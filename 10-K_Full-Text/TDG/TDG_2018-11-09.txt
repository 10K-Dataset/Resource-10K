PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

The Company

TransDigm Inc. was formed in 1993 in connection with a leveraged buyout transaction. TD Group was formed in 2003 to facilitate a leveraged buyout of TransDigm Inc. The Company was owned by private equity funds until its initial public offering in 2006. TD Group’s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol “TDG.”

We believe we are a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers. We estimate that about 90% of our net sales for fiscal year


were generated by proprietary products. In addition, for fiscal year


, we estimate that we generated about 80% of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider.

Most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue. Once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft, we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft, which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years. A typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years, giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years. We estimate that approximately 60% of our net sales in fiscal year


were generated from aftermarket sales, the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets. These aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs.

Products

We primarily design, produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components (and certain systems/subsystems) with significant aftermarket content. We seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers. We attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering, service and manufacturing capabilities. We typically choose not to compete for non-proprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower



margins than proprietary products. We believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality, reliability and customer support.

Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers. Some of our more significant product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, NiCad batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, rods and locking devices, engineered connectors and elastomers, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized cockpit displays, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces and related components, lighting and control technology, military personnel parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems.

Segments

The Company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments: Power & Control, Airframe and Non-aviation.

The Power & Control segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic, fluid, power and mechanical motion control technologies. Major product offerings include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, databus and power controls, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices and cargo loading and handling systems. Primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the OEM and aftermarket market channels.

The Airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that are used in non-power airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies. Major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices, rods and locking devices, engineered connectors and elastomers, cockpit security components and systems, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces and related components, lighting and control technology, military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems. Primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the OEM and aftermarket market channels.

The Non-aviation segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market products for non-aviation markets. Major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications, mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls for space applications, and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries. Primary customers of this segment are off-road vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers, child restraint system suppliers, satellite and space system suppliers and manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries.

For financial information about our segments, see Note 16, “Segments,” to the consolidated financial statements included herein, which is incorporated by reference.

Pending Acquisition of Esterline Technologies Corporation

On October 9, 2018, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Esterline Technologies Corporation (“Esterline”), under which the Company agreed to acquire Esterline.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company will purchase each share of Esterline common stock outstanding for $122.50 per share in cash.  TransDigm anticipates that the total transaction value will be approximately $4 billion, representing the $122.50 price paid per share for common stock outstanding plus existing debt.   The Company expects the acquisition to be financed primarily through existing cash on hand and the incurrence of new term loans. In connection with the merger agreement, the Company entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured term facility up to $3.7 billion.  The actual amount and timing of the new senior secured term facility is subject to the closing of the Esterline acquisition and the cash on hand at that time. The Company currently expects that the merger will be completed in 2019, subject to approval of Esterline’s shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

For further details on the acquisitions and divestiture that occurred during fiscal 2018, refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included herein, which is incorporated by reference.

Sales and Marketing

Consistent with our overall strategy, our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs. In particular, we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to high-margin, repeatable sales in the aftermarket.



We have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings, assigning a business unit manager to certain products. Each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings, sales, new business and profitability for such products. The business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major OEM and aftermarket accounts. Account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel, organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and, together with the business unit managers, to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations. Most of our sales personnel are evaluated, in part, on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities.

Though typically performed by employees, the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer, product and geographic location. We also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts. Our major distributors are Aviall, Inc. (a subsidiary of The Boeing Company) and Satair A/S (a subsidiary of Airbus S.A.S.).

Manufacturing and Engineering

We maintain approximately 80 manufacturing facilities. Most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing, distribution and engineering functions, and most facilities have certain administrative functions, including management, sales and finance. We continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs, including rationalization of operations, developing improved control systems that allow for accurate accounting and reporting, investing in equipment, tooling, information systems and implementing broad-based employee training programs. Management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers.

We attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery. Our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The aggregate of engineering expense and research and development expense represents approximately 8% of our operating units’ aggregate costs, or approximately 4% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2018. Our proprietary products, and particularly our new product initiatives, are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry. These proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements.

We use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements, specifications and Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and OEM requirements. We perform a variety of testing procedures as required by our customers, such as testing under different temperature, humidity and altitude levels, flammability testing, shock and vibration testing and X-ray fluorescent measurement. These procedures, together with other customer approved techniques for document, process and quality control, are used throughout our manufacturing facilities.  Refer to Note 3, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to total costs of research and development, which is incorporated by reference.

Customers

We predominantly serve customers in the commercial, regional, business jet and general aviation aftermarket, which accounts for approximately 36% of total sales; the commercial aerospace OEM market, comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers, which accounts for approximately 24% of total sales; and the defense market, which accounts for approximately 35% of total sales. Non-aerospace sales comprise approximately 5% of our total sales.

Our customers include: (1) distributors of aerospace components; (2) worldwide commercial airlines, including national and regional airlines; (3) large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft OEMs; (4) various armed forces of the United States and friendly foreign governments; (5) defense OEMs; (6) system suppliers; and (7) various other industrial customers. For the year ended September 30,


, Airbus S.A.S. (which includes Satair A/S, a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world) accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales and The Boeing Company (which includes Aviall, Inc., also a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world) accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers for fiscal year


accounted for approximately 43% of our net sales. Products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms.

Active commercial production programs include the Boeing 737 (including the 737MAX), 747, 767, 777 and 787, the Airbus A220 (previously known as the Bombardier CSeries), A320 family (including neo), A330, A350 and A380, the Bombardier CRJs, Q400/Dash-8 aircraft, Challenger and Learjets, the Embraer regional and business jets, the Cessna Citation family, the Gulfstream aircraft family, the Dassault aircraft family, the HondaJet and the ATR42/72 turboprop.  Military platforms include aircraft such as the Boeing AH-64 Apache, CH-47, C-17, F-15, F-18, KC46 Tanker, P-8 and V-22, the Airbus A400M, the Lockheed Martin C-130J, F-16 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter, the Northrop Grumman E-2C Hawkeye, the General



Atomics Predator Drone and the Raytheon Patriot Missile. We have been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the Airbus A330neo, the Boeing 777x, the Bombardier Global 7500/8000, the Embraer E2, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet and the Sikorsky S-97 and JMR helicopter.

The markets in which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns.  The demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on, among other things, the breadth of our installed OEM base, revenue passenger miles (“RPMs”), the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, the percentage of the worldwide fleet that is in warranty, and airline profitability. The demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends, military campaigns and political pressures.

Competition

The niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide. Due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry, competition in these categories comes from both U.S. and foreign companies. Competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately-held entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios.

We compete on the basis of engineering, manufacturing and marketing high quality products, which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers, consistent and timely delivery, and superior customer service and support. The industry’s stringent regulatory, certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products. If customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards, we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process. In addition, we believe that the availability, dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue long-term supplier relationships.

Government Contracts

Companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: (1) suspend us from receiving new contracts; (2) terminate existing contracts; (3) reduce the value of existing contracts; (4) audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; (5) control and potentially prohibit the export of our products; and (6) seek repayment of contract related payments under certain circumstances. Violations of government procurement laws could result in civil or criminal penalties.

Governmental Regulation

The commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and by the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe and other agencies throughout the world, while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies, and, in many cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models.

We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs and airlines that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services. We also maintain several FAA approved repair stations.

In addition, our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters. Without limiting the foregoing, sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses, including the disposal of hazardous wastes, are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws.

Market Channels

The commercial aerospace industry, including the aftermarket and OEM market, is impacted by the health of the global economy and geo-political events around the world. The commercial aerospace industry has shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles, or RPMs, since 2010, and positive growth continued through 2018 with increases in RPMs, as well as the growth in the large commercial OEM sector (aircraft with 100 or more seats) with order announcements by The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S. leading to planned increases in production. The 2019 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued RPM growth and increases in production at the OEM level.



The defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints, the timing of orders, political pressures and the extent of global conflicts. It is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry.

Our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk. We service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry, and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft, which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform. At times, declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another channel. However, due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to OEM and aftermarket customers, variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin.

There are many short-term factors (including inventory corrections, unannounced changes in order patterns, strikes and mergers and acquisitions) that can cause short-term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years. As such, it can be difficult to determine longer-term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons. To normalize for short-term fluctuations, we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete short-term periods.

There are also fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter-to-quarter, as well as variations in product mix from quarter-to-quarter, that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial OEMs. Again, in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators.

Commercial Aftermarket

The key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide RPMs and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft and the percentage of the fleet that is in warranty.

Commercial OEM Market

The commercial transport market sector, the largest sector in the commercial OEM market, grew modestly during 2018. Our commercial transport OEM shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the Boeing and Airbus airframe delivery schedules. As a result and consistent with prior years, our fiscal 2019 shipments will be a function of, among other things, the estimated 2019 and 2020 commercial airframe production rates. We have been experiencing increased sales in the large commercial OEM sector (aircraft with 100 or more seats) driven by an increase in production by The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S tied to previous order announcements. Industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2019 and 2020, though the growth may continue to moderate and begin to flatten.

Defense

Our military business fluctuates from year to year, and is dependent, to a degree, on government budget constraints, the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts. For a variety of reasons, the military spending outlook is very uncertain. For planning purposes we assume that military related sales of our types of products to be flat in future years over the recent high levels.

Raw Materials

We require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes. We also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers. At times, we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships. Most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices.

Intellectual Property

We have various trade secrets, proprietary information, trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, which we believe, in the aggregate but not individually, are important to our business.

Backlog

As of September 30,


, the Company estimated its sales order backlog at $2,026 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of $1,669 million as of September 30,


. The increase in estimated sales order backlog is primarily due to organic growth in the commercial and defense markets and growth from acquisitions.  The majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of September 30,


are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months. Purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment. The level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the Company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, the Company’s backlog as of September 30,


may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.



Foreign Operations

Although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the United States, we manufacture some products in Belgium, China, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Sri Lanka, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers (including distributors) located in the United States, our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers (including airlines and other end users of aircraft) throughout the world. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including currency fluctuations, difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations, general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate, limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, change in trade policies, tariff regulation, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition.

Environmental Matters

Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.  For information regarding environmental accruals, see Note 14, “Environmental Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included herein, which is incorporated by reference.

Employees

As of September 30,


, we had approximately 10,100 full-time, part-time and temporary employees. Approximately 10% of our full-time and part-time employees were represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from December 2018 to May 2022. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

Set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report.

Our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability. These items are, in turn, affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions.

Our commercial business is directly affected by, among other factors, changes in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, the percentage of the fleet that is out-of-warranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry. RPMs and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment, although national and international events also play a key role. For example, in the past, the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy, higher fuel prices, the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of September 11, 2001, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and the conflicts abroad, and could be impacted by future geopolitical or other worldwide events, such as war, terrorist acts, or a worldwide infectious disease outbreak. In addition, global market and economic conditions have been challenging with turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending. As a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events, the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties. Some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights. During periods of reduced airline profitability, some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts, preferring instead to deplete existing inventories, and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending. If demand for spare parts decreases, there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products.  An adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our



expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.

Our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical, and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us.

Our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft, such as The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S, and related OEM suppliers, as well as manufacturers of business jets (which collectively accounted for approximately 24% of our net sales in fiscal year


) have historically experienced periodic downturns. In the past, these sales have been affected by airline profitability, which is impacted by, among other things, fuel and labor costs, price competition, interest rates, downturns in the global economy and national and international events. In addition, sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by, among other things, downturns in the global economy. Downturns adversely affect our net sales, gross margin and net income.

We rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales.

Our two largest customers for fiscal year


were Airbus S.A.S. (which includes Satair A/S) and The Boeing Company (which includes Aviall, Inc.). Airbus S.A.S. accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales and The Boeing Company accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales in fiscal year


. Our top ten customers for fiscal year


accounted for approximately 43% of our net sales. A material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason, including but not limited to economic downturn, decreased production, strike or resourcing, could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, gross margin and net income.

We generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products. Further, when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, we take the risk for cost overruns.

As is customary in our business, we do not generally have long-term contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and, therefore, do not have guaranteed future sales. Although we have long-term contracts with many of our OEM customers, many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and, in most cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements, and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize.

We also have entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of our customers, pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products. Sometimes we accept a fixed-price contract for a product that we have not yet produced, and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices, taxes or labor costs.

U.S. military spending is dependent upon the U.S. defense budget.

The military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends, particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (the “DOD”) budget. In addition to normal business risks, our supply of products to the United States Government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. DOD budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration, the U.S. Government’s budget deficits, spending priorities, the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce U.S. Government military spending, each of which could cause the DOD budget to remain unchanged or to decline. A significant decline in U.S. military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government.

We intend to pursue acquisitions. Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations.

A significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions. Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. We intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support. In addition, we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions. Because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.

We regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. Future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and



amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs.

Acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business. The successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to service, attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities.

We are subject to many of the foregoing risks in connection with our recently announced agreement to acquire Esterline, and these risks may be exacerbated due to the scale and complexity of that acquisition as compared to our recent acquisitions.  The acquisition is not expected to close until 2019, subject to approval of Esterline’s shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, so there can be no assurance that we will not encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays in the process or that we will be able to consummate the acquisition as contemplated or at all.  If the acquisition is completed, it will require extensive integration efforts.  These efforts could result in significant unforeseen costs and will require substantial attention from our senior management.  If we are unable to successfully integrate Esterline or the acquisition otherwise does not perform to our expectations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  It is also possible that the substantial management attention required by, and the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with, the transaction could cause us to forgo other acquisition opportunities, particularly if we encounter delays or unexpected costs or the acquisition otherwise does not perform to our expectations.

We are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the U.S. Government.

Companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:

•

suspend us from receiving new contracts based on alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;

•

terminate existing contracts;

•

reduce the value of existing contracts; and

•

audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.

Most of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government for its convenience without significant notice. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination.

On contracts for which the price is based on cost, the U.S. Government may review our costs and performance, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement.

Furthermore, even where the price is not based on cost, the U.S. Government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable.” Our subsidiaries are periodically subject to a pricing review and in fact, government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries’ products are currently the subject of a DOD Office of Inspector General audit with respect to prices paid for such products.  Pricing reviews and government audits, including the one underway, could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business. As a result of such a review, we could be subject to providing a refund to the U.S. Government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the DOD could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts. Any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from, or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with, certain agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government.

Moreover, U.S. Government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements, which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting.  Failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased.

The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States and in other countries. In order to sell our components, we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the FAA, the DOD and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers. If new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases, we



might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight. In addition, if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our business would be adversely affected.

In addition to the aviation approvals, we are at times required to obtain approval from U.S. Government agencies to export our products. Failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the U.S. Government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the United States, and the penalties that could be imposed by the U.S. Government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of

September 30, 2018

, our total indebtedness, excluding approximately

$17.5 million

of letters of credit outstanding, was approximately

$12.9 billion

, which was

116.3%

of our total book capitalization as a result of our prior year special dividends being funded, in part, with indebtedness and the addition of approximately

$1.1 billion

in net new incremental borrowings during fiscal


.

Also, in connection with the merger agreement to acquire Esterline for approximately $4 billion, the Company entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured term facility up to $3.7 billion.  The actual amount and timing of the new senior secured term facility is subject to the closing of the Esterline acquisition and the cash on hand at that time.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. For example, as of

September 30, 2018

, we had approximately

$582.5 million

of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility. Although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior subordinated notes outstanding (the “Indentures”) contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial. For example, if the usage of the revolving loan facility exceeds 25% of the total revolving commitments, the Company will be required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt, as defined, to trailing four-quarter EBITDA As Defined. A breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the Indentures.

An increase in our substantial indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions;

•

increase the risk we are subjected to downgrade or put on a negative watch by the ratings agencies;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, make investments and incur liens.

In addition, all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility, which includes

$7.6 billion

in term loans and a revolving loan facility of

$600 million

, bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, our debt service expense will also increase. Interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings under our credit facilities. For information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements, see Note 20, “Derivatives and Hedging Instruments,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including the Indentures. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness. If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital.

To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Indentures, amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts due under our Securitization Facility, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability



to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule, or at all, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts borrowed under our Securitization Facility and the Indentures, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, the Securitization Facility, the Indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the Indentures.

The terms of the senior secured credit facility and Indentures may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.

Our senior secured credit facility and the Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The senior secured credit facility and Indentures include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) to:

•

incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

•

pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;

•

make investments;

•

sell assets;

•

enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;

•

incur or allow to exist liens;

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;

•

engage in transactions with affiliates;

•

create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

•

engage in certain business activities.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the Indentures. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes. If the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.

We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.

Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by subsidiaries of the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.



Estimates of the Company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts, laws, regulations and technology. These estimates take into consideration the Company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the Company’s environmental advisors. Estimates of the Company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates, the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.

Accordingly, as investigation and remediation proceed, it is likely that adjustments in the Company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period. Based on currently available information, however, the Company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

We are dependent on our senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business.

Because our products are complicated and highly engineered, we depend on an educated and trained workforce. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry, and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees. We may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel.

Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable. Because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods, any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers.

In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors’ hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense. A loss of senior management and key personnel, or failure to attract qualified new talent could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results and/or market value could be adversely affected.

The Board continually monitors this risk and we believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with our straightforward strategy, clear value drivers, decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk.

We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.

From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits, including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers.

Our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components. Our business, therefore, could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers (such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure, a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality), or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers. Because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive FAA and OEM certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.



Our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.

A number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater Los Angeles area, an area known for earthquakes, and are thus vulnerable to damage. In addition, a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the Eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fire, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Disruptions could also occur due to cyber-attacks, computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error or process failures.  Any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Operations and sales outside of the United States may be subject to additional risks.

A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including currency fluctuations, difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations, general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate, limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, change in trade policies, tariff regulation, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition. Furthermore, the Company is subject to laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and similar local anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their employees, agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject the Company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.

We face significant competition.

We operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies. Competitors in our product lines are both U.S. and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities. We believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance, consistent high quality, short lead-time and timely delivery, competitive pricing, superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.

We could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash.

Our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced. While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate. We also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us.

In addition, a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products. We believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components. If a crash were to be caused by one of our components, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.

We could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns.

The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Further, although we are implementing internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the GDPR and other privacy-related laws, rules and regulations (collectively, the “Data Protection Laws”), there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all Data Protection Laws.

Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and implement data security measures, our facilities, and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and other data loss, including cyber-attacks and, in fact, we have experienced data security incidents that have not had a material impact on our financial results. In addition, it is not possible to predict the impact on our business of the future loss, alteration or misappropriation of information in our possession related to us, our employees, former employees, customers, suppliers or others. This could lead to negative publicity, legal claims, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes, operational disruptions and other significant costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.



We have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, which may never generate the returns we expect.

Mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets, which primarily include trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, and technology, were approximately

$1.8 billion

at

September 30, 2018

, representing approximately

15%

of our total assets. Goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately

$6.2 billion

at

September 30, 2018

, representing approximately

51%

of our total assets. We may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards, we would be required to write-off the amount of any impairment.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions.  The Company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions.  The Company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations.  In addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the Company is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities.  If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Our stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.

There has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities. These market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock.  Such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering, which could cause short-term swings in profit margins.  Or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance, such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock, such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy, changes to or confidence in our management, or expectations for future growth of the Company.

Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price.

We may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate.

Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 149,600,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock. Without stockholder approval, the Board of Directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock, voting together as a single class, is required for the alteration, amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings, notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting, requests for stockholder lists and corporate records, nomination and removal of directors, and filling of vacancies on our Board of Directors.

We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder,” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, “interested stockholder” means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203.



We do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock.

On July 3, 2013, June 4, 2014, October 14, 2016 and August 23, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized and declared special cash dividends of $22.00, $25.00, $24.00 and $22.00, respectively, on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments to holders of options under its stock option plans.

Notwithstanding the special cash dividends, we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future. The amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements. Any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

TransDigm’s principal owned properties (defined as greater than 10,000 square feet or related to a principal operation) as of September 30,

Our Cleveland, OH and Pasadena, CA corporate facilities house our principal executive offices, and we currently lease approximately 20,100 square feet and 5,300 square feet, respectively, for those purposes. TransDigm also leases certain of its other non-material facilities. Management believes that our machinery, plants and offices are in satisfactory operating condition and that it will have sufficient capacity to meet foreseeable future needs without incurring significant additional capital expenditures.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We and certain of our current or former officers and directors are defendants in a consolidated securities class action captioned

In re TransDigm Group, Inc. Securities Litigation

, Case No. 1:17-cv-01677-DCN (N.D. Ohio).  The cases were originally filed on August 10, 2017, and September 18, 2017 and were consolidated on December 5, 2017.  A consolidated amended complaint was filed on February 16, 2018. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false or misleading statements with respect to, or failed to disclose, the impact of certain alleged business practices in connection with sales to the U.S. government on the Company’s growth and profitability.  The plaintiffs assert claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated



thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief.  In addition, we, as nominal defendant, and certain of our current or former officers and directors are defendants in a shareholder derivative action captioned

Sciabacucchi v. Howley et al.

, No. 1:17-cv-1971-DCN (N.D. Ohio). The case was filed on September 19, 2017.  The plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duty and other claims arising out of substantially the same actions or inactions alleged in the securities class actions described above. This action has been stayed pending the outcome of a motion to dismiss on the securities class action.  Although we are only a nominal defendant in the derivative action, we could have indemnification obligations and/or be required to advance the costs and expenses of the officer and director defendants in the action.

We intend to vigorously defend these matters and believe they are without merit.  We also believe we have sufficient insurance coverage available for these matters.  Therefore, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  However, given the preliminary status of the litigation, it is difficult to predict the likelihood of an adverse outcome or estimate a range of any potential loss.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol “TDG.”

Holders

On November 2, 2018, there were 35 stockholders of record of our common stock. We estimate that there were approximately 70,000 beneficial stockholders, which includes an estimated amount of stockholders who have their shares held in their accounts by banks and brokers.

Dividends

During fiscal 2017, TD Group’s Board of Directors authorized and declared special cash dividends of $24.00 (in October 2016) and $22.00 (in August 2017) on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments under options granted under its stock incentive plans.  No dividends were declared during fiscal 2018.

We do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Any declaration of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions under the senior secured credit facility and Indentures, the availability of surplus under Delaware law and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. TD Group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries. Unless TD Group receives dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries, TD Group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future. The ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our senior secured credit facility and Indentures and may be limited by future debt or other agreements that we may enter into.

ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table sets forth selected historical consolidated financial and other data of TD Group for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 to 2018, which have been derived from TD Group’s audited consolidated financial statements.

Separate historical financial information of TransDigm Inc. is not presented since the 5.50% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in October 2012 (the “2020 Notes”), the 6.00% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in June 2014 (the “2022 Notes”), the 6.50% Senior Subordinated Notes issued June 2014 (the “2024 Notes”), the 6.50% Senior Subordinated Notes issued May 2015 (the “2025 Notes”) and the 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes issued June 2016 (the “6.375% 2026 Notes”) (also together with the 2020 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes, and the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by TD Group, TransDigm UK and all of TransDigm Inc.’s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries and because TD Group has no significant operations or assets separate from its investment in TransDigm Inc.

Separate financial information of TransDigm UK Holdings plc (“TransDigm UK”) is not presented because TransDigm UK’s 6.875% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in May 2018 (the “6.875% 2026 Notes”) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by TD Group, TransDigm Inc., and all of  TransDigm Inc.’s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries.

Acquisitions of businesses and product lines completed by TD Group during the last five fiscal years are as follows:

All of the acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method. The results of operations of the acquired businesses and product lines are included in TD Group’s consolidated financial statements from the effective date of each acquisition.

In connection with the settlement of a Department of Justice investigation into the competitive effects of the acquisition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company committed to dispose of the Schroth business.  Therefore, Schroth was classified as held-for-sale beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The results of operations of Schroth are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. On January 26, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Schroth in a management buyout to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately $61.4 million, which includes a working capital adjustment of $0.3 million that was settled in July 2018.  Further disclosure related to Schroth’s discontinued operations is included within Note 22, “Discontinued Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements.

The information presented below should be read together with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere herein.

(5)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company committed to disposing of Schroth in connection with the settlement of a Department of Justice investigation into the competitive effects of the acquisition.  Therefore, Schroth was classified as held-for-sale beginning September 30, 2017. The loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended September 30, 2017 includes a $32.0 million impairment charge to write down the assets to fair value.  On January 26, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Schroth in a management buyout to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately $61.4 million, which includes a working capital adjustment of $0.3 million that was settled in July 2018. Refer to Note 22, “Discontinued Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We present below certain financial information based on our EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined. References to “EBITDA” mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to “EBITDA As Defined” mean EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined presented below.

Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We present EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined because we believe they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity.

Our management believes that EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities analysts, investors, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company’s ability to incur and service debt. In addition, EBITDA As Defined is useful to investors because the revolving commitments under our senior secured credit facility requires compliance under certain circumstances, on a pro forma basis, with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our Consolidated EBITDA defined in the same manner as we define EBITDA As Defined herein.

In addition to the above, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections. Moreover, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions.



Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;

•

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;

•

the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and

•

EBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA or EBITDA As Defined in isolation and specifically by using other GAAP measures, such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

(1)

For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium and the portion (approximately 33%) of rental expense that management believes is representative of the interest component of rental expense.

(2)

EBITDA represents earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA As Defined represents EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined and the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined presented below. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information and limitations regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “Selected Financial Data” and TD Group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.

Overview

For fiscal year


, we generated net sales of

$3,811.1 million

, gross profit of

$2,177.5 million

or

57.1%

of sales, and net income of

$957.1 million

. We believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term.

Our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business. The integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business.

We believe our key competitive strengths include:

Large and Growing Installed Product Base with Aftermarket Revenue Stream.

We provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. We estimate that our products are installed on approximately 95,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.

Diversified Revenue Base.

We believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. Our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. We expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications.

Barriers to Entry

. We believe that the niche nature of our markets, the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements, the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products.

Our business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.

Value-Driven Operating Strategy.

Our three core value drivers are:

•

Obtaining Profitable New Business.

We attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. We have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and OEM products to drive our growth.

•

Improving Our Cost Structure.

We are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.

•

Providing Highly Engineered Value-Added Products to Customers.

We focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. We believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. This has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so.

Selective Acquisition Strategy.

We selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. The aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. We have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. As of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired approximately 70 businesses and/or product lines since our formation in 1993. Many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing TransDigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume.



Acquisitions and the divestiture during the most recent three fiscal years are more fully described in Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.

Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see Note 3, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances

: Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. Collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale. Provisions for returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. We have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances; however, due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts:

Management estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness. The allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. Management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information. The determination of the amount of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. Depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues, or if the financial condition of any of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired, increases in these allowances may be required. Historically, changes in estimates in the allowance for uncollectible accounts have not been significant.

Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. Because the Company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 25 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. Where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. Although management believes that the Company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. In addition, in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year. Historically, changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

: In accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. In addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the Company used a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets.

Fair value adjustments to the Company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition

.

Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Company’s intent to do so. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.

GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting



unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.

At the time of goodwill impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit. For the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.

Management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. As an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting unit’s estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the Company.

The Company had 35 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the date of the last annual impairment test. The estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values, and therefore, no goodwill impairment was recorded. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values. With a one percentage point increase in the discount rate, nearly all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. Management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the WACC methodology considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. Management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.

The discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.

Stock-Based Compensation

: The cost of the Company’s stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with ASC 718, “Stock Compensation.”  The Company uses a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the Company’s common shares, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the stock options award and the Company’s dividend yield. The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management’s control could have an impact on the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

Income Taxes

: The Company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. Historically, such adjustments have not been significant.

$192.9 million

, or

9.7%

, for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

compared to the comparable period last year due to the following items:

•

Gross profit on the sales from the acquisitions indicated above (excluding acquisition-related costs) was approximately $49.3 million for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

, which represented gross profit of approximately 42.8% of the acquisition sales. The lower gross profit margin on the acquisition sales decreased gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales by approximately 0.5 percentage points.

•

Organic sales growth described above, application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume, resulted in a net increase in gross profit of approximately $133.2 million for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

.

•

Also contributing to the increase in gross profit were lower inventory purchase accounting adjustments of

$13.5 million

and

$8.0 million

in favorable foreign currency movement, particularly related to the U.S. dollar against the Euro over the course of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.  Partially offsetting these increases in gross profit is an increase in acquisition integration costs of

$9.8 million

and an increase in stock compensation expense of

$1.3 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

.



Selling and Administrative Expenses.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by

$34.5 million

to

$450.1 million

, or

11.8%

of sales, for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

from

$415.6 million

, or

11.9%

of sales, for the comparable period last year. Selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2018

and


were as follows (amounts in millions):

The increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of

$11.6 million

, higher selling and administrative expenses from organic sales growth of $11.4 million and recent acquisitions of approximately $10.4 million, which was approximately 9% of acquisition sales, and an increase in acquisition-related expenses of

$1.1 million

.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased

$16.8 million

to

$72.4 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

from

$89.2 million

for the comparable period last year. The net decrease was primarily due to the order backlog recorded in connection with the Young & Franklin/Tactair and Data Device Corporation acquisitions becoming fully amortized prior to fiscal 2018.  This is slightly offset by amortization expense on the definite-lived intangible assets (i.e., technology and order backlog) recorded in connection with the Skandia, Extant, Kirkhill and the Third Quarter 2017 acquisitions.

Refinancing Costs.

Refinancing costs of

$6.4 million

were recorded during the year ended

September 30, 2018

representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity as disclosed in Note 11, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements. Refinancing costs of $39.8 million recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 primarily consisted of $28.8 million in premium paid on the redemption of the 2021 Notes and the write-off of $3.1 million in unamortized debt issuance costs

and debt issuance costs expensed in connection with new debt issuance that occurred in fiscal 2017.

Interest Expense-net.

Interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium, and revolving credit facility fees offset by interest income. Interest expense-net increased $

60.4 million

, or

10.0%

, to

$663.0 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

from

$602.6 million

for the comparable period last year. The net increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings, which was approximately $12,603 million for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

compared to approximately $10,993 million for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

. The weighted average cash interest rate was at 5.1% during the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

compared to 5.3% in the prior year. The increase in weighted average level of borrowings was primarily due to the activity in the third fiscal quarter of 2018 consisting of the incurrence of additional term loans of $700 million (gross), $500 million in 6.875% 2026 senior subordinated notes, an additional $100 million drawn on the trade receivable securitization facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and additional net debt financing of $575 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.  The increases in new debt described above was partially offset by principal payments on the term loans over the comparable period.  The weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding at

September 30, 2018

was 5.2%.

Income Taxes.

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately

2.4%

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

compared to

24.9%

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

. The Company’s lower effective tax rate for year ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate that was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) which reduced the tax rate from 35% to 21% as well the one-time impact related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities under the Act. As a result, the blended statutory tax rate for the fiscal year is 24.5%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was less than the Federal statutory tax rate due primarily to excess tax benefits on equity compensation, foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rates, and the domestic manufacturing deduction. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

compared to the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and the one-time impact under the Act.

Loss from Discontinued Operations

. On January 26, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Schroth in a management buy out to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately $61.4 million which includes a



working capital adjustment of $0.3 million that was settled in July 2018. The loss from discontinued operations was

$4.5 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

. Loss from discontinued operations is comprised of the operating loss from the Schroth operations that were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2017. The loss includes a $32 million impairment charge to write-down Schroth’s assets to fair value. More detailed information can be found in Note 22, “Discontinued Operations.”

September 30, 2017

of

$596.9 million

was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of

$159.3 million

resulting in net income available to common shareholders of

$437.6 million

. The increase in earnings per share of

$8.32

per share to $16.20 per share is a result of the factors referred to above.

Total Company

Net Sales

. Net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2017

and


were as follows (amounts in millions):

Acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition date. The amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was attributable to the Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions in fiscal year 2017 and the acquisitions of Y&F/Tactair, DDC and Breeze-Eastern in fiscal year 2016.

The increase in organic sales was primarily driven by commercial aftermarket organic sales increasing by $34.8 million, or 3.0% and defense organic sales increasing by $41.5 million, or 4.4%.  Slightly offsetting the increases was commercial OEM organic sales decreasing by $2.8 million, or 0.3%.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit

. Cost of sales increased by

$76.4 million

, or

5.3%

, to

$1,519.7 million

for the fiscal year ended

compared to

$1,443.3 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2016

. Cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2017

and


were as follows (amounts in millions):

The increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

was primarily due to increased volume associated with the sales from acquisitions and organic sales growth.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by

2.1

percentage points to

56.6%

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

from

54.5%

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2016

. The dollar amount of gross profit increased by

$256.5 million

, or

14.8%

, for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

compared to the comparable period last year due to the following items:

•

Gross profit on the sales from the acquisitions indicated above (excluding acquisition-related costs) was approximately $153.6 million for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

, which represented gross profit of approximately 60% of the acquisition sales. The higher gross profit margin on the acquisition sales increase gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales by approximately 1 percentage point.

•

Organic sales growth described above, application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products to



customers), and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume, resulted in a net increase in gross profit of approximately $106.2 million for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

.

•

Gross profit decreased

$11.8 million

as foreign currency losses increased due to the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This was partially offset by the reduction of the impact of inventory purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition integration costs and stock compensation expense charged to cost of sales of approximately $8.5 million.

Selling and Administrative Expenses.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by

$32.7 million

to

$415.6 million

, or

11.9%

of sales, for the fiscal year ended

from

$382.9 million

, or

12.1%

of sales, for the comparable period last year. Selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2017

and


were as follows (amounts in millions):

The increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately $47.7 million, which was approximately 19% of acquisition sales.  The increase is partially offset by lower acquisition-related and stock compensation expense of $19.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets increased to

$89.2 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2017

from

$77.4 million

for the comparable period last year. The net increase of

$11.8 million

was primarily due to the Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions and full year amortization recorded from the fiscal 2016 acquisitions of Breeze-Eastern, DDC and Y&F/Tactair.

Refinancing Costs.

Refinancing costs of $39.8 million were recorded during the year ended September 30, 2017 representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity as disclosed in Note 11, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements. Included within the $39.8 million was approximately $31.9 million

in debt issuance costs and premium related to the repurchase of the 2021 Notes.

Refinancing costs of $15.8 million were recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity in June 2016.

Interest Expense-net.

Interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium, and revolving credit facility fees offset by interest income. Interest expense-net increased $118.7 million, or 24.5%, to $602.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $483.9 million for the comparable period last year. The net increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings, which was approximately $10,993 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and approximately $8,834 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The weighted average cash interest rate was consistent at 5.3% during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. The increase in weighted average level of borrowings was due to the issuance of the 2026 Notes for $950 million in June 2016, the incremental term loans of $950 million in June 2016, the additional net debt financing of $641 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, the additional 2025 Notes offering of $300 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2017, the additional $100 million drawn on the trade receivable securitization facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the additional net debt financing of $575 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

and


were as follows (amounts in millions):

Organic sales for the Power & Control segment increased $70.8 million, or an increase of 4.4%, when compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The organic sales increase resulted primarily from increases in commercial aftermarket sales ($40.9 million, an increase of 7.5%), defense sales ($28.2 million, an increase of 4.4%), and commercial OEM sales ($1.0 million, an increase of 0.3%). Acquisition sales for the Power & Control segment totaled $234.7 million, or an increase of 14.4%, resulting from the Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions and the acquisitions of Tactair, DDC and Breeze-Eastern in fiscal year 2016.

Organic sales for the Airframe segment decreased $5.8 million, or a decrease of 0.4%, when compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.

Backlog

For information about our backlog, see Item 1. - “Business.”

Foreign Operations

Our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately

$1,355.1 million

,

$1,318.9 million

, and

$1,169.5 million

for the fiscal years


,


and


, respectively. Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the Company within such governments’ countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy.

Inflation

Many of the Company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation, which could result in changing operating costs. Furthermore, recently implemented changes to U.S. and other countries’ tariff and import/export regulations may have an unfavorable impact on raw materials pricing. The effects of inflation on the Company’s businesses during the fiscal years


,


and


were immaterial.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. We expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and/or through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt.

We continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business. The Company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage, taking into consideration the Company’s debt holders, equity holders, credit ratings, acquisition opportunities and other factors. The Company’s debt leverage ratio, which is computed as total debt divided by EBITDA As Defined for the applicable twelve-month period, has varied widely during the Company’s history, ranging from approximately 3.5 to 7.2. Our debt leverage ratio at

September 30, 2018

was approximately

6.9

.

If the Company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt.  Whether the Company undertakes additional common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, the Company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so.

The Company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the Company’s indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the Company’s ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control.

As a result of the additional debt financing during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements.  However, in connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide more than sufficient cash from operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs.  We believe our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own stock, make strategic business combinations and/or pay dividends to our shareholders.

In connection with the merger agreement to acquire Esterline for approximately $4 billion, the Company entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured term facility up to $3.7 billion.  The actual amount and timing of the new senior secured term facility is subject to the closing of the Esterline acquisition and the cash on hand at that time. The merger is anticipated to close in 2019, subject to approval of Esterline’s shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

In the future, the Company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends. Our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.

Operating Activities

. The Company generated

$1,022.2 million

of net cash from operating activities during fiscal


compared to

$788.7 million

during fiscal


. The net increase of  $233.5 million is primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations of $156.6 million (excludes the non-cash effects of the adjustments resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $176.4 million).  Changes in inventories, accounts payable and trade accounts receivable improved by approximately $23.4 million compared to the prior year.  The changes in inventories, accounts payable and trade accounts receivable are more fully described below.

The change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal


was a use of

$43.8 million

in cash compared to a use of cash of

$54.7 million

in fiscal


, which is a reduction to the use of cash of

$10.9 million

year over year.  The reduction in the use of cash in fiscal


compared to fiscal


is attributable to the timing of sales and a higher rate of collections on trade accounts receivable.

The change in inventories was a use of cash of

$10.8 million

in fiscal


compared to a source of cash of

$5.1 million

in fiscal


.  The increase in inventories compared to prior year relates to the building up of inventories at certain reporting units during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 based on existing backlog for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

The change in accounts payable during fiscal


was a source  of cash of

$18.1 million

compared to a use of cash of

$10.4 million

in fiscal


.  The decrease in the use of cash was primarily attributable to the timing of payments to vendors.

The Company generated

$788.7 million

of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2017 compared to

$683.3 million

during fiscal 2016. The net increase is primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations and items adjusting



net income for non-cash expenses and income of $38.8 million, and favorable changes in trade accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable of $28.9 million, net.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities was

$683.6 million

during fiscal


, primarily consisting of cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of Kirkhill, Extant, and Skandia of

$667.6 million

and capital expenditures of

$73.3 million

slightly offset by the cash proceeds received from the sale of Schroth of

$57.4 million

. The Company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019 to be between $85 million and $100 million.  The Company’s capital expenditures incurred from year to year are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improve our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers).

Net cash used in investing activities was

$287.0 million

during fiscal


, primarily consisting of cash paid for the Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions of $106.3 million, the cash settlement of the Breeze-Eastern dissenting shares litigation of $28.7 million, the acquisition of Schroth of

$79.7 million

and capital expenditures of

$71.0 million

.

Net cash used in investing activities was

$1,443.0 million

during fiscal


, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of Breeze-Eastern, DDC, and Y&F/Tactair for a total of $1,401.5 million and capital expenditures of

$44.0 million

.

Financing Activities

. Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

was

$1,085.6 million

.  The source of cash was primarily due to the net proceeds of $678.6 million from the fiscal 2018 term loans activity and net proceeds of $489.6 million from the issuance of the 6.875% 2026 Notes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, along with $57.8 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. Partially offsetting these sources of cash was

$56.1 million

in dividend equivalent payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was $1,443.7 million.  The use of cash was primarily related to the aggregate payment of $2,581.6 million for a $24.00 per share special dividend declared and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a $22.00 per share special dividend declared and paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and dividend equivalent payments.  Also contributing to the use of cash was $1,284.7 million in debt service payments on the existing term loans and the remaining principal on the tranche C term loans, redemption and related premium paid on the 2021 Notes aggregating to $528.8 million and $389.8 million related to treasury stock purchases under the Company's share repurchase program.  Slightly offsetting the uses of cash were net proceeds from the 2017 term loans (tranche F and tranche G term loans) of $2,937.7 million and the additional 2025 Notes offering of $300.4 million, $99.5 million in net proceeds from an additional A/R Securitization draw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and $21.2 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.

Net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $1,632.5 million, which primarily comprised of net proceeds from the fiscal 2016 term loans of $1,711.5 million, net proceeds from our 2026 Notes of $939.6 million, and $30.1 million of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options. These increases were partially offset by $834.4 million of repayments on our existing term loans, $207.8 million  in treasury stock purchases under the Company’s share repurchase programs, $3.0 million in dividend equivalent payments and the impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 which resulted in the excess tax benefits related to share-based payment arrangements being classified within operating activities beginning in fiscal 2016.

Description of Senior Secured Term Loans and Indentures

Senior Secured Credit Facilities

TransDigm has

$7,599.9 million

in fully drawn term loans (the “Term Loans Facility”) and a $600 million revolving credit facility.  The Term Loans Facility consists of three tranches of term loans as follows (aggregate principal amount disclosed is as of

September 30, 2018

):

The Term Loans Facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of $19.1 million. The revolving commitments consist of two tranches which include up to $99.4 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. At

September 30, 2018

, the Company had

$17.5 million

in letters of credit outstanding and

$582.5 million

in borrowings available under the revolving commitments. The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Credit Agreement are, at TransDigm’s option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent agreed to by each relevant lender, nine or twelve-month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The adjusted LIBO rate is not subject to a floor. For the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

, the applicable interest rates ranged from approximately 4.1% to 5.1% on the existing term loans.  Interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset, respectively, the



variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in Note 11, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included herein.

Recent Amendments to the Credit Agreement

On November 30, 2017, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

(“Amendment No. 4”)

. Pursuant to Amendment No. 4, TransDigm, among other things, converted approximately

$798.2 million

of existing tranche D term loans into additional tranche F term loans and decreased the margin applicable to the existing tranche E term loans and tranche F term loans to LIBO rate plus

2.75%

per annum and also removed the LIBO rate floor of 0.75%. The terms and conditions (other than maturity date and pricing) that apply to the tranche F term loans are substantially the same as the terms and conditions that apply to the tranche D term loans immediately prior to Amendment No. 4.

On February 22, 2018, the Company entered into a refinancing facility agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. TransDigm, among other things,

incurred new tranche G term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to

$1,810 million

and repaid in full all of the existing tranche G term loans outstanding under the Second and Amended Restated Credit Agreement immediately prior to the refinancing facility agreement.  The refinancing facility agreement also

decreased the margin applicable to the tranche G term loans to LIBO rate plus

2.5%

per annum. The terms and conditions that apply to the tranche G term loans, excluding pricing, are substantially the same as the terms and conditions that apply to the tranche G term loans immediately prior to the refinancing facility agreement.

On May 30, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 5"). Pursuant to Amendment No. 5, TransDigm, among other things,

incurred new tranche E term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to

$1,322 million

, and repaid in full all of the existing tranche E term loans outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement immediately prior to Amendment No. 5.  The Company also incurred incremental tranche E term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to

$933 million

.  The new tranche E term loans and incremental tranche E term loans mature on May 30, 2025. Amendment No. 5 also

decreased the margin applicable to the new tranche E term loans to LIBO rate plus

2.5%

per annum. The terms and conditions that apply to the tranche E term loans, other than the maturity date and margin, are substantially the same as the terms and conditions that apply to the tranche E term loans immediately prior to Amendment No. 5.

Additionally, pursuant to Amendment No. 5, the Company incurred new tranche F term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to

$3,578 million

, and repaid in full all of the existing tranche F term loans outstanding under the Second and Amended Restated Credit Agreement immediately prior to Amendment No. 5. Amendment No. 5 also decreased the margin applicable to the tranche F term loans to LIBO rate plus

2.5%

per annum.

Under the terms of Amendment No. 5, the maturity date of our

$600 million

revolving credit facility was extended to December 28, 2022. The revolving commitments consist of two tranches which includes up to $99.4 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. The terms and conditions that apply to the revolving credit facility, other than the maturity date, are substantially the same as the terms and conditions that applied to the revolving credit facility immediately prior to Amendment No. 5.

Amendment No. 5 extended our ability to make certain additional restricted payments (including the ability of the Company to declare or pay dividends or repurchase stock) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,500 million, so long as, among other conditions, the consolidated secured net debt ratio is no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 (in the case of share repurchases) or the consolidated net leverage ratio is no greater than 6.75 to 1.00 (in the case of dividends or other distributions), in each case, after giving pro forma effect to such transactions.  If any portion of the $1,500 million is not used for dividends or share repurchases prior to December 31, 2018, such amount (not to exceed $500 million) may be used to repurchase stock at any time thereafter.

Indentures

The 2020 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, and the 6.375% 2026 Notes (the “TransDigm Inc. Notes”) were issued at a price of 100% of the principal amount. The initial $450 million offering of the 2025 Notes (also considered to be part of the “TransDigm Inc. Notes”) were issued at a price of 100% of the principal amount and the subsequent $300 million offering in the



second quarter ended of fiscal 2017 of 2025 Notes were issued at a price of 101.5% of the principal amount, resulting in gross proceeds of $304.5 million. The 6.875% 2026 Notes (the "TransDigm UK Notes," and together with the TransDigm Inc. Notes, the "Notes," are further described below) offered in May 2018 were issued at a price of 99.24% of the principal amount, resulting in gross proceeds of $496.2 million.

The Notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity. Interest under the Notes is payable semi-annually. The Notes represent our unsecured obligations ranking subordinate to our senior debt, as defined in the applicable indentures.

The Notes are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior debt, rank equally with all of our existing and future senior subordinated debt and rank senior to all of our future debt that is expressly subordinated to the Notes. The TransDigm Inc. Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated unsecured basis by TD Group and TransDigm Inc.'s domestic restricted subsidiaries. The TransDigm UK Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by TransDigm Inc., TD Group and TransDigm Inc.'s domestic restricted subsidiaries. The guarantees of the Notes are subordinated to all of the guarantors’ existing and future senior debt, rank equally with all of their existing and future senior subordinated debt and rank senior to all of their future debt that is expressly subordinated to the guarantees of the Notes. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of TD Group’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. The Notes contain many of the restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement. TransDigm is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Notes.

The TransDigm UK Notes were issued during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by TransDigm UK, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of TD Group, at a discount of 0.76%.

Certain Restrictive Covenants in Our Debt Documents

The Credit Agreement and the Indentures governing the Notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of special dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of certain other indebtedness.

The restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement are subject to amendments executed periodically.  The most recent amendment that impacted the restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Agreement is Amendment No. 5.  The restrictive covenants are described above in the

Recent Amendments to the Credit Agreement

section.

Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, TransDigm is entitled, on one or more occasions, to request additional term loans or additional revolving commitments to the extent that the existing or new lenders agree to provide such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments provided that, among other conditions, our consolidated net leverage ratio would be no greater than 7.25 to 1.00 and the consolidated secured net debt ratio would be no greater than 5.00 to 1.00, in each case, after giving effect to such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments.

The Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments of principal based on certain percentages of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement), commencing 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, subject to certain exceptions (including, with respect to asset sales, the reinvestment in productive assets), TransDigm will be required to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and issuance or incurrence of certain indebtedness. No matters mandating prepayments occurred during the quarter ended

September 30, 2018

.

In addition, under the Credit Agreement, if the usage of the revolving credit facility exceeds 25% of the total revolving commitments, the Company will be required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt, as defined, to trailing four-quarter EBITDA As Defined. A breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the Credit Agreement or the Indentures.

If any such default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the holders of the Notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Credit Agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes.

As of

September 30, 2018

, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

Trade Receivables Securitization

During fiscal 2014, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the “Securitization Facility”). The Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company’s borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations’ trade accounts receivable. The Securitization Facility includes the right for the Company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. The Company uses the proceeds from the Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs.  On July 31, 2018, the Company amended



the Securitization Facility to increase the borrowing capacity to $350 million and extend the maturity date to July 31, 2019. As of September 30, 2018, the Company has borrowed $300 million under the Securitization Facility. The Securitization Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s domestic operations’ trade accounts receivable.

Stock Repurchase Program

On November 8, 2017,

our Board of Directors, authorized a new stock repurchase program replacing the previous $600 million program and permitting repurchases of our outstanding shares not to exceed $650 million in the aggregate, subject to any restrictions specified in the Credit Agreement and/or Indentures governing the existing Notes.

No repurchases were made under the program during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

Contractual Obligations

The following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of

September 30, 2018

(in millions):

(1)

The tranche E term loans mature in May 2025, the tranche F term loans mature in June 2023, and the tranche G term loans mature in August 2024. The term loans require quarterly principal payments totaling $19.1 million.

(2)

Assumes that the variable interest rate on our tranche E, tranche F and tranche G borrowings under our Senior Secured Term Loans range from approximately 4.74% to 5.66% based on anticipated movements in the LIBO rate. In addition, interest payments include the impact of the existing interest rate swap and cap agreements described in Note  20, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities” to the consolidated financial statements herein.

In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, the Company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and, from time to time, for facility expansion. Capital expenditures totaled approximately

$73.3 million

,

$71.0 million

, and

$44.0 million

during fiscal years


,


, and fiscal


, respectively. The Company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019 to be between $85 million and $100 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations. Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

New Accounting Standards

For information about new accounting standards, see Note 4, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” to our consolidated financial statements included herein.



Additional Disclosure Required by Indentures

Separate financial statements of TransDigm Inc. are not presented because TransDigm Inc.’s 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes and 6.375% 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by TD Group, TransDigm UK and all of TransDigm Inc's Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries and because TD Group has no significant operations or assets separate from its investment in TransDigm Inc.

Separate financial statements of TransDigm UK are not presented because TransDigm UK's 6.875% 2026 Notes, issued in May 2018, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and all of TransDigm Inc.'s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At

September 30, 2018

, we had borrowings under our term loans of approximately

$7,600 million

that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our term loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the Company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans. The Company's objective is to maintain an allocation of approximately 75% fixed rate and 25% variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates.  The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately $76 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at

September 30, 2018

. The weighted average interest rate on the

$7,600 million

of borrowings under our term loans on

September 30, 2018

was 4.5%.

Interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in Note 20, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,” to our consolidated financial statements included herein.  We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

For information about the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our term loans and the fair value of the Notes, see Note 19, “Fair Value Measurements,” to our consolidated financial statements included herein.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of

September 30, 2018

, TD Group carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of TD Group’s management, including its President, Chief Executive Officer and Director (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of TD Group’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the President, Chief Executive Officer and Director and Chief Financial Officer concluded that TD Group’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by TD Group in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to TD Group’s management, including its President, Chief Executive Officer and Director and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, TD Group’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of TD Group is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, TransDigm’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2018

. Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

September 30, 2018

.

During fiscal


, we completed the acquisitions of Kirkhill, Extant and Skandia.  The results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, we have excluded these acquisitions from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2018

. Total assets as of September 30, 2018, net sales and income from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for these fiscal


acquisitions constituted approximately 6%, 2% and 2%, respectively, of each of these key measures as reported in our consolidated financial statements.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2018

has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal


that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

TransDigm Group Incorporated

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited TransDigm Group Incorporated’s ("the Company") internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)

(the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018, based on the COSO criteria

.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Kirkhill, Extant and Skandia, which are included in the 2018 consolidated financial statements of TransDigm Group Incorporated and constituted 6% of total assets as of September 30, 2018, 2% of revenues and 2% of pre-tax income for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of TransDigm Group Incorporated also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Kirkhill, Extant and Skandia.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’ deficit for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2018 and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) of the Company and our report dated November 9, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting in Item 9A of the Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION

Appointment of Officer

The Company has, effective November 10, 2018, appointed Sarah Wynne, age 44, as Chief Accounting Officer of the Company. Ms. Wynne was most recently a Group Controller of the Company (since 2015). Prior to that, Ms. Wynne was Controller at Aero Fluid Products, a TransDigm operating company (2009 -2015) and held accounting positions with increasing responsibility.

Employment Agreement with Named Executive Officer

On November 6, 2018, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Robert Henderson whereby Mr. Henderson will continue to serve as Vice Chairman of the Company.  Mr. Henderson’s prior employment agreement was scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2018.  It is intended that Mr. Henderson will be responsible for planning for the integration of the Esterline acquisition and, upon closing, integrating the Esterline business.  The Employment Agreement replaced Mr. Henderson’s Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated January 25, 2018. The term of the Employment Agreement will expire on December 31, 2021, unless earlier terminated by the Company or Mr. Henderson; provided, however, that if the Esterline acquisition has not been completed by December 31, 2019, the Employment Agreement will terminate.  The Employment Agreement contemplates that Mr. Henderson will spend full time working for the Company.  This is a change from the prior agreement, which contemplated that Mr. Henderson would work approximately three-quarters time.

Mr. Henderson will receive equity compensation in lieu of cash compensation for salary and bonus on similar terms to those contained in the employment agreement of Mr. Howley, the Company’s Executive Chairman.  Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Henderson will receive $10,000 in cash to cover his employee co-premiums for health benefits and related taxes and, for 2019 salary, a grant of options calculated on a Black Scholes basis with a 37.5% risk premium equal to $750,000.  In addition, Mr. Henderson is entitled to participate in the Company’s annual cash incentive plan with a target bonus of 80%, which will be paid in options calculated in the same manner as his salary. Mr. Henderson may give notice one time during the term of the Employment Agreement if he wishes to discontinue his receipt of equity compensation effective with his bonus or as of the following year.  Other than the manner in calculating the option grant, which was a fixed number in Mr. Henderson’s prior employment agreement, these provisions did not change materially from the prior employment agreement.

The options granted in lieu of salary and bonus will vest 40% immediately and, to the extent the performance criteria is met, 40% at completion of the first fiscal year after the grant and 20% after the second fiscal year after the date of grant. These options will include provisions with regard to post-employment vesting upon termination of employment by reason of death, disability, good reason, without cause or retirement (each as defined in the Employment Agreement). More specifically, if Mr. Henderson’s employment terminates for the aforementioned reasons after the first fiscal year following the date of grant but on or after the second fiscal year end following the date of grant, 40% of the remaining unvested options may continue to vest in accordance with their terms; if Mr. Henderson’s employment terminates for the aforementioned reasons after the second fiscal year end following the date of grant but on or prior to the third fiscal year end following the date of grant, 80% of the remaining unvested options may continue to vest in accordance with their terms; and if Mr. Henderson’s employment terminates for any of the aforementioned reasons after the third fiscal year end following the date of grant, 100% of the remaining unvested options may continue to vest in accordance with their terms.   Mr. Henderson is entitled to participate in the Company’s stock option plan and the other employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements that the Company may maintain from time to time for its senior officers.  These provisions did not change from the prior employment agreement.

The Employment Agreement provides that if Mr. Henderson is terminated for any reason, he will be entitled to payment of any accrued but unpaid base salary through the termination date, any unreimbursed expenses, an amount for accrued but unused sick and vacation days, and benefits owing to him under the benefit plans and programs sponsored by the Company. In addition, if Mr. Henderson’s employment is terminated without cause, if he terminates his employment for customary good reasons, or if his employment terminates due to his death or disability, the Company will pay him, in substantially equal installments over a 12-month period, an amount equal to one times his salary plus one times the greater of the all of the bonuses paid or payable to him for the prior fiscal year (excluding any extraordinary bonus) or the target bonuses for the year in which his employment terminates, determined in accordance with the Company’s bonus program(s) if any, plus 18 times the difference of the monthly COBRA continuation coverage rate and the monthly cost of coverage to Mr. Henderson as of the date of termination.  These provisions did not change from the prior employment agreement.

The Employment Agreement also includes non-competition, non-solicitation provisions, confidentiality and indemnity consistent with Mr. Henderson’s prior agreement. These provisions did not change from the prior employment agreement.

The foregoing description of the terms of the Employment Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith.

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS

Description of the Business

—TransDigm Group Incorporated (“TD Group”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, TransDigm Inc., is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly every commercial and military aircraft in service today. TransDigm Inc., along with TransDigm Inc.’s wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries for which it has a controlling interest (collectively, with TD Group, the “Company” or “TransDigm”), offers a broad range of proprietary aerospace components. TD Group has no significant assets or operations other than its

100%

ownership of TransDigm Inc. TD Group’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the trading symbol “TDG.”

Major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, NiCad batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, rods and locking devices, engineered connectors and elastomers, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized cockpit displays, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces and related components, lighting and control technology, military personnel parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems.

2.    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

During the last three fiscal years, the Company completed the acquisitions of Skandia, Extant, Kirkhill, three separate aerospace product lines (collectively, the “Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions”), Y&F/Tactair, DDC and Breeze-Eastern. The Company accounted for the acquisitions using the acquisition method and included the results of operations of the acquisitions in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of each acquisition. As of

September 30, 2018

, the one-year measurement period is open for Skandia, Extant, and Kirkhill; therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to these acquisitions are subject to adjustment until the end of their respective one-year measurement periods.  The Company is in the process of obtaining a third-party valuation of certain intangible assets and tangible assets and liabilities of Skandia, Extant and Kirkhill. Pro forma net sales and results of operations for the acquisitions had they occurred at the beginning of the applicable fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

or


, are not material and, accordingly, are not provided.

The acquisitions strengthen and expand the Company’s position to design, produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components in niche markets with significant aftermarket content and provide opportunities to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers). The purchase price paid for each acquisition reflects the current earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and cash flows, as well as the future EBITDA and cash flows expected to be generated by the business, which are driven in most cases by the recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of a particular aircraft, estimated to be approximately


to

30 years

.

Skandia

– On July 13, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Skandia Inc. ("Skandia") for a total purchase price of approximately

$84.3 million

, which is net of a

$0.2 million

working capital settlement paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Skandia provides highly engineered seating foam, foam fabrication, flammability testing and acoustic solutions for the business jet market. Skandia is included as a product line within an existing reporting unit in TransDigm's Airframe segment.  The Company expects that no goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

Extant

– On April 24, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Extant for a total purchase price of approximately

$532.5 million

in cash, which is net of a

$0.2 million

working capital settlement received in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Extant provides a broad range of proprietary aftermarket products and repair and overhaul services to the aerospace and defense end markets. Extant owns or exclusively licenses in excess of 2,500 assemblies and sub-assemblies on over 70 active platforms. Extant is included in TransDigm's Power and Control segment.

Prior to the Company's acquisition of Extant, Extant was owned by an equity fund sponsored by Warburg Pincus LLC. Michael Graff, a director of TransDigm, is a managing director of Warburg Pincus LLC and was chairman of the board of Extant. Robert Henderson, Vice Chairman of TransDigm, was also on the board of Extant and owned less than 2% of Extant on a fully diluted basis. In addition, Mr. Graff, W. Nicholas Howley, TransDigm's Executive Chairman, and Messrs. Douglas Peacock and David Barr, directors of TransDigm, each had minority interests of less than 1% in the Warburg Pincus LLC fund that owned Extant.

F-7


The total purchase price of Extant was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon management’s estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, such excess was allocated to goodwill. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the transaction date (in thousands).

The Company expects that approximately

$44 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes over


years and approximately

$358 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Kirkhill

– On March 15, 2018, the Company acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Kirkhill elastomers business from Esterline Technologies for a total purchase price of approximately

$49.3 million

, which is net of a

$0.6 million

working capital settlement received in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Kirkhill's products are primarily proprietary, sole source with significant aftermarket content and used in a broad variety of most major commercial transport and military platforms. Kirkhill is included in TransDigm's Airframe segment. The Company expects that no goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

The Kirkhill acquisition includes loss contract reserves recorded at a fair value of approximately

$39.2 million

at September 30, 2018. Of the

$39.2 million

in loss contract reserves,

$9.0 million

is included accrued liabilities and

$30.2 million

is included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2018. The Company is committed under certain existing Kirkhill agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices that are not sufficient to cover the costs to produce such product.  These agreements were existing at the time of the acquisition. The value of this reserve is analyzed and adjusted at each reporting period.

Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions

– The Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately

$106.7 million

in cash, which includes working capital settlements totaling

$1.0 million

paid in the third and fourth quarters of  fiscal 2017 and an earn-out of $0.4 million paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. All three product lines consist primarily of proprietary, sole source products with significant aftermarket content. The products include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, and communication electronics. Each product line acquired was consolidated into an existing TransDigm reporting unit within TransDigm's Power & Control segment.  Approximately

$66 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes over


years and approximately

$9 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes.

Schroth

– On February 22, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Schroth Safety Products GmbH and certain aviation and defense assets and liabilities from subsidiaries of Takata Corporation (collectively, "Schroth"), for a total purchase price of approximately

$89.7 million

, of which consisted primarily of

$79.7 million

paid in cash during fiscal 2017 and an approximately

$9.0 million

indemnity holdback, of which

$8.5 million

was paid in April 2018 and

$0.5 million

remains a reserve as of September 30, 2018.

In connection with the settlement of a Department of Justice investigation into the competitive effects of the acquisition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company committed to dispose of the Schroth business.  Therefore, Schroth was classified as held-for-sale beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017. The results of operations of Schroth are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

On January 26, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Schroth in a management buyout to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately

$61.4 million

, which includes a working capital adjustment of

$0.3 million

that was settled in July 2018.  Further disclosure related to Schroth’s discontinued operations is included in Note 22.

F-8

years and approximately

$8 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

Data Device Corporation

– On June 23, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of ILC Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Data Device Corporation, for a total purchase price of approximately

$997.7 million

in cash, which includes a working capital settlement of

$1.4 million

received in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. TransDigm financed the acquisition of DDC with cash proceeds from the issuance of senior subordinated notes due in June 2026 and term loans. DDC is a supplier of databus and power controls and related products that are used primarily in military avionics, commercial aerospace and space applications. DDC is included in TransDigm’s Power & Control segment.

The total purchase price of DDC was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon management’s estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, such excess was allocated to goodwill. The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the transaction date (in thousands).

Approximately

$740 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes and approximately

$11 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes over


years.

Breeze-Eastern

– On January 4, 2016, the Company completed the tender offer for all of the outstanding stock of Breeze-Eastern for

$19.61

per share in cash.  The purchase price was approximately

$205.9 million

, of which

$146.4 million

(net of cash acquired of $

30.8 million

) was paid at closing and

$34.9 million

was paid to dissenting shareholders during the first fiscal quarter of 2017. Of the

$34.9 million

payment,

$28.7 million

related to the original merger consideration and

$6.2 million

represented the settlement reached with the dissenting shareholders resolving the dispute over the dissenting shareholders’ statutory appraisal action. Of the

$6.2 million

settlement,

$4.9 million

was recorded as selling and administrative expense and

$1.3 million

was recorded as interest expense for statutory interest arising under Delaware General Corporate Law. Once the Company paid the

$34.9 million

settlement to the dissenting shareholders on October 20, 2016,  the dissenting stockholders fully released their claims against the Company.  Breeze-Eastern manufactures high performance lifting and pulling devices for military and civilian aircraft, including rescue hoists, winches and cargo hooks, and weapons-lifting systems. Breeze-Eastern is included in TransDigm’s Power & Control segment. All of the approximately

$115 million

of goodwill recognized for the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

3.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

—The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of TD Group and subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to current year presentation related to an organizational realignment effective October 1, 2017 of certain businesses comprising the Power & Control and the Non-Aviation segments.

F-9


Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances

—Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. Provisions for estimated returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates.

Shipping and Handling Costs

—Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.

Research and Development Costs

—The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred and classifies such amounts in selling and administrative expenses. The expense recognized for research and development costs for the years ended

September 30, 2018

,


and


was approximately

$73.8 million

,

$73.8 million

, and

$58.6 million

, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

—The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts

—The Company reserves for amounts determined to be uncollectible based on specific identification of losses and estimated losses based on historical experience. The allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. The determination of the amount of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. If circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate or improve, the allowance for uncollectible accounts could increase or decrease.

Inventories

—Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory is made based on management’s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements from


to


years, buildings and improvements from


to


years, machinery and equipment from


to


years and furniture and fixtures from


to


years.  Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur. Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred.

Property, plant and equipment is assessed for potential impairment whenever indicators of impairment are present by determining whether the carrying value of the property can be recovered through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations over the property’s remaining estimated useful life. Any impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.  Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.

Debt Issuance Costs, Premiums and Discounts

—The cost of obtaining financing as well as premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective obligations as a component of interest expense within the consolidated statements of income. Debt issuance costs are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liabilities.

Financial Instruments

—Interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floating-rate borrowings under our credit facility. The interest rate swap and cap agreements utilized by the Company effectively modify the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of the Company’s floating-rate debt to a fixed rate basis through the expiration date of the interest rate swap and cap agreements, thereby reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the term of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. These derivative instruments qualify as effective cash flow hedges under GAAP.

For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instruments was initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ deficit and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line as the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affected earnings. As the interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk, any gains or losses from the derivative instruments that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in interest expense - net in the consolidated statements of income.

Intangible Assets

—Intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles acquired or recognized in accounting for the acquisitions (trademarks, trade names, technology, order backlog and other intangible assets) and goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives (i.e., trademarks and trade names) are subject to annual impairment testing. Management

F-10


determines fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques. The Company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce fair value below current value.

At the time of goodwill impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is therefore necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test consists of two steps.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit (as defined) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired, and the second step of the goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. The second step measures the amount of impairment, if any, by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill associated with a reporting unit to the implied fair value of the goodwill derived from the estimated overall fair value of the reporting unit and the individual fair values of the other assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.

GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.

The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between their fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the sum of any such excesses.

The Company assesses the recoverability of its amortizable intangible assets only when indicators of impairment are present by determining whether the amortization over their remaining lives can be recovered through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations. Amortization of amortizable intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: technology from


to


years, order backlog over

one year

, and other intangible assets over


years.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company records stock-based compensation expense using the fair value method of accounting. Compensation expense is recorded over the vesting periods of the stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives. No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives ultimately forfeited because the recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.

Income Taxes

—The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred taxes are recorded for the difference between the book and tax basis of various assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Contingencies

—During the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time threatened with, or may become a party to, legal actions and other proceedings. While the Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings, it believes the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—The term “comprehensive income (loss)” represents the change in stockholders’ equity (deficit) from transactions and other events and circumstances resulting from non-stockholder sources. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, consisting principally of fair value adjustments to its interest rate swap and cap agreements (net of tax), cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and pension liability adjustments (net of tax), is reported separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

—The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenue and expense items are translated at the average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized currently in income, and those resulting from translation of financial statements are accumulated as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) for the period. Foreign currency gains or losses recognized currently in income from changes in exchange rates were immaterial to our results of operations.

Earnings per Share

—Earnings per share information is determined using the two-class method, which includes the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and other securities that participate in dividends (“participating securities”). Our vested stock options are considered “participating securities” because they include non-forfeitable rights to dividends. In applying the two-class method, earnings are allocated to both common stock shares and participating securities based

F-11


on their respective weighted-average shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share information may include the additional effect of other securities, if dilutive, in which case the dilutive effect of such securities is calculated using the treasury stock method.  Contingently issuable shares are not included in earnings per share until the period in which the contingency is satisfied; therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.

4.    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, which created a new topic in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” In addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard beginning October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.

We have established our accounting policy, provided training to the Company’s reporting units and completed our evaluation of the new standard, including the impact on our business processes, systems and controls, and differences in the timing and/or method of revenue recognition for our contracts. As a result of the evaluation, the Company identified changes to and modified certain of our accounting policies and practices. The Company also designed and implemented specific controls over the evaluation of the impact of the new standard, including the calculation of the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard.  We determined that the revenue recognition for our products and services will remain largely unchanged; and therefore, the adoption of ASC 606 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  We will provide expanded disclosures as required under ASC 606 in the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (ASC 842),” which will require that a lessee recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a lease term of more than twelve months, with the result being the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability.  Additionally, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, "Codification Improvements to ASC 842, Leases" which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new leases standard. The new leases standard guidance is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods, including interim periods therein, beginning October 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13)," which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. The new model uses a forward-looking expected loss method, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows—Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments," which clarifies existing guidance related to accounting for cash receipts and cash payments and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” to eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test in order to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, "Compensation—Retirement Benefits (ASC 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost," that will change how employers that sponsor defined benefit and/or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Under the new guidance, employers will present the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item(s) as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets. Employers will present the other components separately from the line item(s) that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income, if one is presented. Employers will have to disclose the line(s) used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost, if the components are not presented separately in the income statement.The standard is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within the fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim

F-12


period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, "Compensation—Stock Compensation (ASC 718): Scope of Modification Accounting," which provides clarity on which changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards require an entity to apply the modification accounting provisions required in ASC 718. The standard is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities,” which amends the FASB’s hedge accounting model to enable entities to better portray their risk management activities in financial statements. The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. ASU 2017-12 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods, including interim periods therein, beginning October 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. As early adoption is permissible, the Company adopted the pronouncement beginning October 1, 2017. Changes were applied prospectively in accordance with the standard and prior periods were not adjusted. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (ASC 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income," which gives entities the option to reclassify tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") into retained earnings. The guidance allows entities to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings stranded tax effects resulting from the Act's new federal corporate income tax rate. The guidance also allows entities to elect to reclassify other stranded tax effects that relate to the Act but do not directly relate to the change in the federal tax rate (e.g., state taxes, changing from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system). Tax effects that are stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income for other reasons (e.g., prior changes in tax law, a change in valuation allowance) may not be reclassified. The standard is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within the fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Entities have the option to apply the guidance retrospectively or in the period of adoption. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, “Income Taxes (ASC 740), Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.” The ASU adds various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of the December 2017 SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which was effective immediately. The SEC issued SAB 118 to address concerns about reporting entities’ ability to timely comply with the accounting requirements to recognize all of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the period of enactment. SAB 118 allows disclosure that timely determination of some or all of the income tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are incomplete by the due date of the financial statements and if possible to provide a reasonable estimate. We have accounted for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act under the guidance of SAB 118, on a provisional basis. Our accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but we have determined reasonable estimates for those effects and have recorded provisional amounts in our consolidated financial statements.  Refer to Note 13, "Income Taxes," for further information.

Trade Receivable Securitization Facility

During fiscal 2014, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the “Securitization Facility”). The Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company’s borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations’ trade accounts receivable. The Securitization Facility includes the right for the Company to exercise annual

one year

extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. The Company uses the proceeds from the Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs. In August 2018, the Company amended the Securitization Facility to increase the borrowing capacity to

$350 million

and extend the maturity date to

July 31, 2019

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from

35%

to

21%

, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred as well as other changes. We recorded provisional tax benefits of

$176.4 million

related to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate. We also recorded a provisional tax expense of

$30.0 million

related to the one-time transition tax.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for years before fiscal 2014. The Company is currently under examination in the U.S. for its fiscal 2014 federal taxes. The Company expects the examinations to be completed during fiscal 2019. In addition, the Company is subject to state income tax examinations for fiscal years 2009 and later.

The Act’s one-time repatriation tax liability effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes in jurisdictions in which we are not considered definitely reinvested, however, such amounts are not significant.

At September 30, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially result in changes to our current estimates. Any revisions to the impacts of the Act will be finalized by the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

14.    ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.

Estimates of the Company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts, laws, regulations and technology. These estimates take into consideration the Company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the Company’s environmental advisors. Estimates of the Company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates, the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.

Accordingly, as investigation and remediation proceed, it is likely that adjustments in the Company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period. Based on currently available information, however, the Company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

Environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable, which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the Company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action. The Company also takes into consideration the estimated period of time in which payments will be required.  The liabilities are reviewed periodically and, as investigation and remediation proceed, adjustments are made as necessary. Liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. The liabilities are not offset by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties, but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state-managed sites, third party indemnity obligations, and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites.

The Company’s consolidated balance sheets includes environmental remediation obligations at

of

$39.1 million

and

$39.9 million

, respectively.

16.    SEGMENTS

The Company’s businesses are organized and managed in

three

reporting segments: Power & Control, Airframe and Non-aviation.

The Power & Control segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic, fluid, power and mechanical motion control technologies. Major product offerings include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, databus and power controls, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices and cargo loading and handling systems. Primary

F-23


customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.

The Airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that are used in non-power airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies. Major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices, rods and locking devices, engineered connectors and elastomers, cockpit security components and systems, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces and related components, lighting and control technology, military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems. Primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.

The Non-aviation segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market products for non-aviation markets. Major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications, mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls for space applications, and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries. Primary customers of this segment are off-road vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers, child restraint system suppliers, satellite and space system suppliers and manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries.

The primary measurement used by management to review and assess the operating performance of each segment is EBITDA As Defined. The Company defines EBITDA As Defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses including refinancing costs, acquisition-related costs, transaction-related costs and non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with the Company’s stock option plans.  Acquisition-related costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold; costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the Company’s operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction related costs comprising deal fees; legal, financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments.

EBITDA As Defined is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP. Although the Company uses EBITDA As Defined to assess the performance of its business and for various other purposes, the use of this non-GAAP financial measure as an analytical tool has limitations, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.

The Company’s segments are reported on the same basis used internally for evaluating performance and for allocating resources. The accounting policies for each segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at values based on market prices, which creates intercompany profit on intersegment sales or transfers that is eliminated in consolidation. Intersegment sales were insignificant for the periods presented below. Certain corporate-level expenses are allocated to the operating segments.

Effective October 1, 2017, the Company made an organizational realignment of certain businesses comprising the Power & Control, Airframe and the Non-Aviation segments. Operating results for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and total assets as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

17.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock compensation plans are designed to assist the Company in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding key employees, directors or consultants, and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders by closely

F-25


aligning the interests of these individuals with those of the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s stock compensation plans provide for the granting of stock options and other stock-based incentives.

Non-cash stock compensation expense recognized by the Company during the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2018

,


and


was

$58.5 million

,

$45.5 million

and

$48.3 million

, respectively.

September 30, 2018

,


and


was

$81.04

,

$67.11

and

, respectively.

Compensation expense is recognized based upon probability assessments of awards that are expected to vest in future periods. Such probability assessments are subject to revision and, therefore, unrecognized compensation expense is subject to future changes in estimate. As of

September 30, 2018

, there was approximately

$74.3 million

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested awards expected to vest, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.5 years

.

The fair value of the Company’s employee stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for all options granted during the fiscal years ended:

The risk-free interest rate is based upon the Treasury bond rates as of the grant date. The average expected life of stock-based awards is based on the Company’s actual historical exercise experience. Expected volatility of stock was calculated using a rate based upon the historical volatility of TransDigm’s common stock. Notwithstanding the special cash dividends declared and paid from time to time, the Company historically has not declared and paid regular cash dividends and does not anticipate declaring and paying regular cash dividends in future periods; thus, no dividend rate assumption is used.

The total fair value of options vested during fiscal years ended

$44.4 million

,

$42.9 million

and

19.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The following tables present our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments (in thousands):

(1)

Included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

(2)

Included in prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheet.

(3)

Included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

(4)

Included in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

(5)

The carrying amount of the debt instrument is presented net of the debt issuance costs.  Refer to Note 11, “Debt”, for gross carrying amounts.

The Company values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. No financial instruments were recognized using unobservable inputs.

Interest rate swaps were measured at fair value using quoted market prices for the swap interest rate indexes over the term of the swap discounted to present value versus the fixed rate of the contract. The interest rate caps were measured at fair value using implied volatility rates of each individual caplet and the yield curve for the related periods. The estimated fair value of the Company’s term loans was based on information provided by the agent under the Company’s senior secured credit facility. The estimated fair values of the Company’s notes were based upon quoted market prices.  There has not been any impact to the fair value of derivative liabilities due to the Company’s own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any impact to the fair value of derivative assets based on the Company’s evaluation of counterparties’ credit risks.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable-net and accounts payable approximated book value due to the short-term nature of these instruments at September 30,


and


.

F-29


20.    DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates in the normal course of business. The Company’s risk management program is designed to manage the exposure and volatility arising from these risks, and utilizes derivative financial instruments to offset a portion of these risks. The Company uses derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to hedge identified business risks and does not enter into such transactions for trading purposes. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security with counterparties to these financial instruments and is therefore subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance; however, the Company monitors credit risk and currently does not anticipate nonperformance by other parties. The Company has agreements with each of its swap and cap counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company defaults on the credit facility the Company could also be declared in default on its swaps and caps, resulting in an acceleration of payment under the swaps and caps.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floating-rate borrowings under our credit facility. The interest rate swap and cap agreements utilized by the Company effectively modify the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of the Company’s floating-rate debt to a fixed rate basis through the expiration date of the interest rate swap and cap agreements, thereby reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the term of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. These derivative instruments qualify as effective cash flow hedges under GAAP. For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instruments was initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ deficit and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line as the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affected earnings. As the interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk, any gains or losses from the derivative instruments that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in interest expense - net in the consolidated statements of income.

The following table summarizes the Company’s interest rate swap agreements:

The following table summarizes the Company’s interest rate cap agreements:

F-30


All interest rate swap and cap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Certain derivative asset and liability balances are offset where master netting agreements provide for the legal right of setoff. For classification purposes, we record the net fair value of each type of derivative position that is expected to settle in less than one year with each counterparty as a net current asset or liability and each type of long-term position as a net non-current asset or liability. The amounts shown in the table below represent the gross amounts of recognized assets and liabilities, the amounts offset in the consolidated balance sheet and the net amounts of assets and liabilities presented therein.

(1)

Refer to Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," for the consolidated balance sheet classification of our interest rate swap and cap agreements.

Based on the fair value amounts of the interest rate swap and cap agreements determined as of

September 30, 2018

, the estimated net amount of existing gains and losses and caplet amortization expected to be reclassified into interest expense within the next twelve months is approximately

$7.3 million

.

Effective September 30, 2016, the Company redesignated the interest rate cap agreements related to the

$400 million

and the

$750 million

aggregate notional amount with cap rates of

2.0%

and

2.5%

, respectively, based on the expected probable cash flows associated with the 2016 term loans and 2015 term loans in consideration of the Company’s ability to select one-month, two-month, three-month, or six-month LIBO rate set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  Accordingly, amounts previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholder’s deficit amortized into interest expense was

$4.0 million

and

$3.8 million

for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The accumulated other comprehensive income to be reclassified into interest expense over the remaining term of the cap agreements is

$11.0 million

with a related tax benefit of

$2.6 million

as of

September 30, 2018

.

Effective December 30, 2017, the Company redesignated the existing interest rate swap agreements related to the

$750 million

,

$500 million

,

$1,000 million

and

$750 million

aggregate notional amounts with swap rates of

5.0%

,

4.4%

,

4.3%

and

5.3%

, respectively, based on the expected probable cash flows associated with certain term loans in consideration of the Company’s removal of the LIBO rate floor on the certain term loans as set forth in Amendment No. 4 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  Accordingly, the amount recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficit related to these redesignated interest rate swap hedges will be amortized into earnings based on the original maturity date of the related interest rate swap agreements. Amounts previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder’s deficit amortized into interest expense was

$0.8 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

. The accumulated other comprehensive income to be reclassified into interest expense over the remaining term of the swap agreements is immaterial.

Effective March 31, 2018, the Company redesignated the existing interest rate swap agreements related to the

$1,000 million

and the

$400 million

aggregate notional amount with swap rates of

4.9%

and

4.4%

, respectively, based on the expected probable cash flows associated with certain term loans in consideration of the Company’s removal of the LIBO rate floor on the certain term loans as set forth in the refinancing facility agreement dated February 22, 2018 related to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Accordingly, the amount recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficit related to these redesignated interest rate swap hedges will be amortized into earnings based on the original maturity date of the related interest rate swap agreements. Amounts previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder’s deficit amortized into interest income was

$1.4 million

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

. The accumulated other comprehensive income to be reclassified into interest income over the remaining term of the swaps agreements is

$11.4 million

with a related tax expense of

22.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In connection with the settlement of a Department of Justice investigation into the competitive effects of the acquisition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company committed to dispose of the Schroth business.  Therefore, Schroth was classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2017. The results of operations of Schroth are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. On January 26, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Schroth in a management buyout to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately

$61.4 million

, which includes a working capital adjustment of

$0.3 million

that was settled on July 6, 2018.  The Company previously acquired Schroth in February 2017 (refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures”).

The loss from discontinued operations was

$4.5 million

and

$31.7 million

in the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Previously, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a

$32.0 million

impairment charge to write down the Schroth assets to fair value. The impairment charge was based on an internal assessment of the recovery of Schroth’s assets. The following is the summarized operating results for Schroth for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):

24.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On October 1, 2018, Extant completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and technical data rights from the Corona, California operations of NavCom Defense Electronics, Inc. (“NavCom”) for approximately

$27 million

in cash.  NavCom is a product line of Extant and therefore will be included in TransDigm’s Power and Control segment.

On October 9, 2018, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Esterline, under which the Company agreed to acquire Esterline.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company will purchase each share of Esterline common stock outstanding for

$122.50

per share in cash.  TransDigm anticipates that the total transaction value will be approximately

$4 billion

, representing the

$122.50

price paid per share for common stock outstanding plus existing debt.  The Company expects the acquisition to be financed primarily through existing cash on hand and the incurrence of new term loans. In connection with the merger agreement, the Company entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured term facility up to
