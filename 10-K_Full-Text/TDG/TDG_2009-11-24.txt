PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

The Company

TransDigm Inc. was formed in July 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses from IMO Industries Inc.
TransDigm Group Incorporated (“TD Group”), was formed in July 2003 at the direction of Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII, L.P. (“Warburg Pincus”) to facilitate the acquisition of TransDigm Inc. In March 2006, certain
stockholders of TD Group and certain members of our management sold shares of TD Group common stock in an underwritten initial public offering. TD Group did not offer any shares of common stock for sale in the initial public offering and TD Group
did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. As a result of the initial public offering, TD Group’s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
“TDG.”

In May 2007, certain of TD Group’s stockholders, including certain members of our management, sold
shares of TD Group’s common stock in an underwritten public offering. As a result of this offering, TD Group was no longer a “controlled company” for the purposes of the NYSE listing requirements. TD Group did not sell any shares in
the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering.

We believe we are a leading global designer, producer and
supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers.

We estimate that over 95% of our net sales for fiscal year 2009 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design. In
addition, for fiscal year 2009, we estimate that we generated approximately 80% of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider.

Most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue. Once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft, we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption
over the life of that aircraft, which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years. We estimate that approximately 60% of our net sales in fiscal year 2009 were generated from aftermarket sales, the vast majority of which come from the
commercial and military aftermarkets. These aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs.

Products

We primarily
design, produce and supply highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components (and certain systems/subsystems) with significant aftermarket content. We seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and
manufacturers. We attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering, service and manufacturing capabilities. We typically choose not to compete for non-proprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins
than proprietary products. We believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality, reliability and customer support.

Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers. Some of our more significant product
offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include: (1) mechanical /electro-mechanical actuators and controls used in numerous actuation applications; (2) ignition systems and
components such as igniters, exciters and spark plugs used to start and spark turbine and reciprocating aircraft engines; (3) gear pumps used primarily in lubrication and fuel applications; (4) specialized valves used in fuel, hydraulic
and pneumatic applications; (5) engineered connectors used in fuel, pneumatic and hydraulic applications; (6) power conditioning devices used to modify and control electrical power; (7) specialized fluorescent lighting;
(8) specialized AC/DC electric motors and components;



(9) aircraft audio systems; (10) engineered latching and locking devices used in various bin, security and other applications; (11) lavatory hardware and components; (12) rods
and locking devices used primarily to hold open cowlings to allow access to engines for maintenance; (13) specialized cockpit displays; (14) elastomers used in various clamping and heating applications; (15) NiCad batteries/chargers
used to provide starting and back-up power; and (16) starter generators and related components.

Sales and Marketing

Consistent with our overall strategy, our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that
meet customer needs. In particular, we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to high-margin, repeatable sales in the aftermarket.

We have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings, assigning a product manager to certain products. Each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the
products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings, sales, new business and profitability for such products. The product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible
for covering major OEM and aftermarket accounts. Account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel, organization and needs of specific customers, to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and,
together with the product managers, to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations. Most of our sales personnel are compensated, in part, on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business
opportunities.

Though typically performed by employees, the account manager function may be performed by independent
representatives depending on the specific customer, product and geographic location. We also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts. Our major distributors are
Aviall, Inc. (a subsidiary of The Boeing Company) and Satair A/S.

Manufacturing and Engineering

We maintain fifteen principal manufacturing facilities. Each manufacturing facility comprises manufacturing, distribution and engineering as
well as administrative functions, including management, sales and finance. We continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs, including rationalization of operations, developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product
profit and loss accounting, investing in equipment, tooling, and information systems and implementing broad-based employee training programs. Management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by
permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers.

We attempt
to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery. Our engineering costs are recorded in Cost of Sales and in Selling and Administrative captions in our Statements of
Income. Total engineering expense represents approximately 9% of our operating units’ aggregate costs, or approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales. Our proprietary products, and particularly our new product initiatives, are designed by
our engineering staff and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry. These proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous
demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements.

We use sophisticated equipment and procedures to attempt
to ensure the quality of our products and comply with military specifications and Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) and OEM certification requirements. We perform a variety of testing procedures, including testing under different
temperature, humidity and altitude levels, shock and vibration testing and X-ray fluorescent measurement. These procedures, together with other customer approved techniques for document, process and quality control, are used throughout our
manufacturing facilities.



Customers

Our customers include: (1) distributors of aerospace components; (2) worldwide commercial airlines, including national and regional airlines; (3) large commercial transport and regional and
business aircraft OEMs; (4) various armed forces of the United States and friendly foreign governments; (5) defense OEMs; (6) system suppliers; and (7) various other industrial customers. For the year ended September 30,
2009, Boeing (which includes Aviall, Inc., a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world) accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales, and Honeywell International, Inc. accounted for approximately 9% of our net
sales. Products supplied to many of our customers, including the two largest customers, are used on multiple platforms.

Active commercial production programs include the Boeing 737, 747, 767 and 777, the Airbus A300, A319/20/21, A330/A340 and A380, the Bombardier CRJ’s and Challenger, the Embraer RJ’s, the Cessna Citation family, the Raytheon
Premier and Hawker and most Gulfstream airframes. Military platforms include aircraft such as the Boeing C-17, F-15 and F-18, the Lockheed Martin C-130J and F-16, the Northrop Grumman E2C (Hawkeye), the Joint Strikefighter and the Blackhawk, Chinook
and Apache helicopters. TransDigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350XWB and A400M programs.

We believe that we have strong customer relationships with almost all large commercial transport, regional, general aviation and military
OEMs. The demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on, among other things, the breadth of our installed OEM base, revenue passenger miles, or RPMs, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and, to a lesser extent, airline
profitability. We believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on U.S. designed military aircraft, including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft, military freighters and military helicopters.

Competition

The niche
markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide. Due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry, competition in these
categories comes from both U.S. and foreign companies. Competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations that have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do, to
small privately-held entities, with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios.

We compete on the basis of
engineering, manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers, consistent and timely delivery, and superior customer service and support. The
industry’s stringent regulatory, certification and technical requirements, and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products, create barriers to entry for potential new competitors. As long as customers receive
products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards, we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process. In addition,
we believe that concerns about safety and flight delays if products are unavailable or undependable are reasons for our customers to continue long-term supplier relationships.

Government Contracts

Companies engaged in supplying defense-related
equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: (1) suspend us from receiving new contracts pending
resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations; (2) terminate existing contracts; (3) reduce the value of existing contracts; (4) audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and
(5) control and potentially prohibit the export of our products.



As described elsewhere in this report, five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been
subject to a U.S. Department of Defense (the “DOD”) Office of Inspector General review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the DOD’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare
parts purchased from those five divisions and subsidiaries in fiscal years 2002 through 2004. For additional information regarding the details and status of the pricing review, please refer to “Risk Factors—Certain of our divisions and
subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the DOD Office of Inspector General.”

Governmental Regulation

The commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the FAA in the United States and by the Joint Aviation Authorities
in Europe and other agencies throughout the world, while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or
agencies, and, in many cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models.

We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs and airlines that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the
government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our
repair and overhaul services. We also maintain several FAA approved repair stations.

In addition, sales of many of our
products that will be used on aircraft owned by non-U.S. entities are subject to compliance with U.S. export control laws.

Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. The Occupational Safety and Health Act, mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and
measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances.

Raw Materials

We require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes. We also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from
various suppliers. At times, we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships. Raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices.

Intellectual Property

We
have various trade secrets, proprietary information, trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, which we believe, in the aggregate but not individually, are important to our business.

Backlog

As of
September 30, 2009, the Company estimated its sales order backlog at $402 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of $418 million as of September 30, 2008. This decrease in backlog of $16 million is mainly due to lower
commercial OEM and aftermarket demand including the impact of order cancellations and pushouts as well as significant reductions in business jet production rates. These declines were partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions of Aircraft
Parts Corporation, Acme Aerospace Inc. and a product line of Woodward Governor Company. The majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of September 30, 2009 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months. Purchase orders may be
subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment. The level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the Company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which
those orders are filled. Accordingly, the Company’s backlog as of September 30, 2009 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.



Foreign Operations

Although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the United States, we manufacture some products in Malaysia through our wholly-owned Malaysian subsidiary. We sell our products in the United
States, as well as in foreign countries. Substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in U.S. dollars and, therefore, we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar as a
result of foreign sales. In addition, the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers, including our Malaysian manufacturing subsidiary, are not material, with substantially all such transactions
being made in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar arising from these transactions.

Our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $150.4 million, $144.3 million, and $143.0 million for fiscal years 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that
foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the Company within such governments’ countries. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy.

Environmental Matters

Our operations and facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations governing, among other matters, the emission, discharge, generation, management, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, wastes and pollutants, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites, and permits required
in connection with our operations. Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws, or the
regulations or requirements thereunder, or in the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future. Further, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines
and sanctions, and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law, or the environmental permits required for our operations.

Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of
investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous
materials also may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them. Because we own and/or operate a number of
facilities that have a history of industrial or commercial use and because we arrange for the disposal of hazardous materials at many disposal sites, we may and do incur costs for investigation, removal and remediation. Contaminants have been
detected at some of our present and former sites, principally in connection with historical operations, and investigations and/or clean-ups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites. We receive inquiries and notices of potential
liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time. Although we have not incurred any material investigation or cleanup costs to date and investigation and cleanup costs are not expected to be material in the future, the
discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites, or the failure of any other potentially liable party to meet its obligations, could result in significant liability for us.

Employees

As of
September 30, 2009, we had approximately 2,000 employees. Approximately 4% of our employees were represented by the United Steelworkers Union, approximately 3% were represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement
Workers of America and approximately 4% were



represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in April 2011, November 2012 and
May 2013, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory.

Legal Proceedings

We are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Based upon information currently known to us, we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition or results of
operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Set
forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report.

Our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide
aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability. These items are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions.

Our business is directly affected by, among other factors, changes in revenue passenger miles (“RPMs”) the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and, to a lesser extent, changes in the profitability of the commercial
airline industry. RPMs and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment, although national and international events also play a key role. For example, in recent years, the airline industry has been
severely affected by the downturn in the global economy, higher fuel prices, the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of September 11, 2001, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, epidemic and the
conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. As a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events, the airline industry incurred, and some in the industry continue to incur, large losses and financial difficulties. Some
carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights. During periods of reduced airline profitability, some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts, preferring instead to deplete existing
inventories. If demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases, there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products.

Future
terrorist attacks may have a material adverse impact on our business.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks, passenger traffic on commercial flights was significantly lower than prior to the attacks and many commercial airlines reduced their operating schedules. Overall, the terrorist attacks resulted in billions of dollars in losses to the
airline industry. Any future acts of terrorism and any military response to such acts could result in further acts of terrorism and additional hostilities, including possible retaliatory attacks on sovereign nations, as well as financial, economic
and political instability. While the precise effects of any such terrorist attack, military response or instability on our industry and our business is difficult to determine, it could result in further reductions in the use of commercial aircraft.
If demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases, demand for certain of our products would also decrease.

Our sales to manufacturers
of aircraft are cyclical, and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us.

Our sales to
manufacturers of large commercial aircraft, such as The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S, related OEM suppliers, as well as manufacturers of business jets, which accounted for approximately 22% of our net sales in fiscal year 2009, have historically
experienced periodic downturns. In the past, these sales have been affected by airline profitability, which is impacted by, among other things, fuel and labor costs, price competition, downturns in the global economy and national and international
events, such as the events of September 11, 2001. In addition, sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by, among other things, downturns in the global economy. Prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales,
gross margin and net income.

We rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales.

Our two largest customers for fiscal year 2009 were Boeing (which includes Aviall, Inc., a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to
airlines throughout the world) and Honeywell International Inc. These two customers accounted for approximately 13% and 9%, respectively, of our net sales in fiscal year 2009. Our top ten customers for fiscal year 2009 accounted for
approximately 44% of our net sales. A reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason, such as economic downturn, decreased production or strike, could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, gross margin and net
income. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.”



We generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products. Further, when we enter into fixed price
contracts with some of our customers, we take the risk for cost overruns.

As is customary in our business, we do not
generally have long-term contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and, therefore, do not have guaranteed future sales. Although we have long-term contracts with many of our OEM customers, many of those customers may terminate the contracts
on short notice and, in most cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers
and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements, and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize.

We also have entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of our customers, pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize all the benefit or
detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products. Sometimes we accept a fixed-price contract for a product that we have not yet produced, and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the
completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices, taxes or labor costs.

U.S. military spending is dependent upon the U.S. defense budget.

The
military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends, particularly the DOD budget. In addition to normal business risks, our supply of products to the United States Government is subject to unique risks largely beyond
our control. Future DOD budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration, the U.S. Government’s budget deficits, spending
priorities, the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and possible political pressure to reduce U.S. Government military spending, each of which could cause the DOD budget to remain unchanged or to decline. A
significant decline in U.S. military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government.

We intend to pursue future acquisitions. Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we
cannot effectively integrate acquired operations.

A significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions.
Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. We intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe
will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms. In
addition, we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the
value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect.

We regularly engage in discussions with respect
to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. Future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and
contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs.

In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business. The successful integration of
new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our



senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers and develop new products and services. In addition,
because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.

We are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the U.S. Government. In addition,
government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to modification and audit.

Companies
engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:

•

suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;

•

terminate existing contracts;

•

reduce the value of existing contracts; and

•

audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.

Most of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to
perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide
for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.

On contracts where the price is based on cost, the U.S. Government may review our costs and performance, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our
contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets, portions of research and
development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement.

In addition to these U.S. Government
contract risks, we are at times required to obtain approval from U.S. Government agencies to export our products. Additionally, we are not permitted to export some of our products. A determination by the U.S. Government that we failed to receive
required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the United States, and the penalties that could be imposed by the U.S. Government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant.

Certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the DOD Office of Inspector General.

Five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been the subject of a DOD Office of Inspector General review of our records for the purpose of
determining whether the DOD’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years 2002 through 2004. On April 19, 2006, the Inspector
General issued its final report dated February 23, 2006 and made public a redacted version of the report. The report recommends (i) that the Defense Logistics Agency request that those five subsidiaries and divisions voluntarily refund, in
the aggregate, approximately $2.6 million for allegedly overpriced parts and (ii) that Defense Logistics Agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased
from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop Strategic Supplier Alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries.



Our position has been, and continues to be, that our pricing has been fair and reasonable
and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the Inspector General in its report. In response to the report, we offered reasons why we disagree with the Inspector General’s overall analysis and why computations
related to the voluntary refund contained in the report fail to consider key data, such as actual historical sales. If the Defense Logistics Agency requests a voluntary refund from any of our divisions or subsidiaries, we would consider such a
request under the circumstances existing at that time.

In February 2006, the Defense Logistics Agency made a request to
initiate discussions regarding future pricing and developing an acquisition strategy that would mutually strengthen our business relationship with the Defense Logistics Agency. Around that time, the parties discussed future purchasing but have not
engaged in negotiations regarding Strategic Supplier Alliances. Negotiations regarding Strategic Supplier Alliances may occur at a later date. As a result of those negotiations, it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the
pricing review will enter into Strategic Supplier Alliances with the Defense Logistics Agency. It is likely that in connection with any Strategic Supplier Alliance, the Defense Logistics Agency will seek prices for parts based on cost. It is also
possible that the DOD may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts. The entry into Strategic Supplier Alliances or a decision by the DOD to pursue alternative sources of supply for parts we currently provide could reduce the amount of
revenue we derive from, and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with, certain agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government.

Our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased.

The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States and in other countries. In order to sell our components,
we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the FAA, the DOD and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers. If new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases, we
might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight. In addition, if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our business would be adversely affected.

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us
from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness, including the notes.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness.
As of September 30, 2009, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,356.8 million (including premium received, net of amortization, in connection with the issuance of the original notes), which was approximately 62.4% of our total
capitalization.

In addition to the foregoing indebtedness outstanding on September 30, 2009, in
October 2009, TransDigm Inc. issued $425 million aggregate principal amount of 7


/


% senior subordinated notes (“New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes”) at an issue price of 97.125% of the principal amount thereof pursuant to an indenture dated October 6, 2009 (the “New Indenture” and together, with the
Indenture referred to below, the “Indentures”). The terms of the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes are substantially identical to the terms of the already outstanding 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes that were issued and sold by TransDigm
Inc. in June 2006 and February 2007. The proceeds from the issuance of the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes, after the original issue discount, were used to make a cash distribution to TD Group, which paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately $375 million,
made dividend equivalent payments to its holders of stock options of approximately $30 million and paid for transaction-related fees and expenses. Our total indebtedness, on a pro forma basis as if the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes were issued and the special dividend was
paid on September 30, 2009, represents approximately 81% of our capitalization.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. For example, as of September 30, 2009, we had $198.0 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility. Although



our senior secured credit facility, the indenture (the “Indenture”) governing the 7


/


% senior subordinated notes issued in June 2006 and February 2007
(the “7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes”)
and the New Indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications
and exceptions could be substantial. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability
to borrow additional funds, make investments and incur liens.

In addition, all of our debt under the senior
secured credit facility, which includes a $780 million term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of $200 million, bears interest at floating rates. Accordingly, in the event that interest rates increase, our debt service expense
will also increase. In order to reduce the floating interest rate risk, as of September 30, 2009, the Company was party to an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate of interest on $300 million of debt under the senior secured credit
facility.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to
generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes. We cannot assure you that our business
will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility
or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness. If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or
seeking additional equity capital.

To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to
generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and amounts borrowed under the senior
secured credit facility, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are
beyond our control.

We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise
in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.
If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital



investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, the Indenture and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any
of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes.

The terms of the senior secured credit facility
and the Indenture may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.

Our senior secured credit facility and the Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its
subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The senior
secured credit facility and Indenture include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its
subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) to:

•

incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

•

pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;

•

make investments;

•

sell assets;

•

enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;

•

incur or allow to exist liens;

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;

•

engage in transactions with affiliates;

•

create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

•

engage in certain business activities.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the Indenture.
If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and the holders of the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable.
The lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the senior secured credit
facility, the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments
on the 7


/

/


% Senior Subordinated Notes. If the debt under
the senior secured credit facility or the 7

Senior Subordinated Notes and/or the New 7

Senior Subordinated Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.



We are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar
employees could adversely affect our business.

Because our products are complicated and highly engineered, we depend on an
educated and trained workforce. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry, and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees. We may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies
created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel.

As of September 30, 2009, we had
approximately 2,000 employees. Approximately 4% of our employees were represented by the United Steelworkers Union, approximately 3% were represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and approximately
4% were represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in April 2011, November 2012 and May 2013, respectively. Although we believe that our
relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable. Because we maintain a
relatively small inventory of finished goods, any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers.

Our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers.

Our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components. Our business, therefore, could be adversely impacted by factors
affecting our suppliers (such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure, a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite
quality), or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers. Because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts, our business could be
adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative
raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive FAA and OEM certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.

We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such environmental laws and regulations.

Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other
things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the remediation of contamination. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions
and/or third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations.

Pursuant to certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire
cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment
of hazardous materials may also be held liable for such costs related to a disposal or treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them. Contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites,
principally in connection with historical operations, and investigations and/or clean-ups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites. We also receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal
facilities from time to time. Although we are not aware of any sites for which material obligations exist, the discovery of additional contaminants, the imposition of additional clean-up obligations or the initiation of suits for personal injury or
damages to property or natural resources could result in significant liability.



We have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, which may never generate the returns we
expect.

Mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.
Identifiable intangible assets, which primarily include trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, license agreements and technology, were approximately $372.9 million at September 30, 2009, representing approximately 15% of our total assets.
Goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately $1,462.3 million at September 30, 2009, representing approximately 60% of our total assets. We may never realize the full value of our identifiable
intangible assets and goodwill, and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting regulations, we would be required to write-off the amount of any
impairment.

We face significant competition.

We operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies, including divisions of larger companies, some of which have significantly greater resources than we do, and
therefore may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. Competitors in our product lines are both U.S. and
foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities. We believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance, consistent high quality, short lead-time and timely
delivery, competitive pricing, superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.

We could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash.

Our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we
have designed, manufactured or serviced. While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims, in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be
adequate. We also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us.

In addition, a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products. We believe our
customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components. If a crash were to be caused by one of our components, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and
reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.

Our stock prices may be volatile, and your
investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.

There has been significant volatility in the market price
and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. You may not be able to
resell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace
industry and other factors such as fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering, which could cause short-term swings in profit margins, or unrelated to our operating performance, including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or
the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically.



Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price.

We may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the
future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that
these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate.

Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition
involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 149,600,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock. Without
stockholder approval, the Board of Directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire us. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board of Directors, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with approximately one-third of the directors coming up for re-election each
year. Having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our Board of Directors through a proxy contest, which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our Board of Directors.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock, voting together as a single class, is required for the
alteration, amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including the provisions authorizing a staggered board, and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, including the
provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings, notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting, requests for stockholder lists and corporate records, nomination and removal of
directors, and filling of vacancies on our Board of Directors.

We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder,” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special
approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, “interested stockholder” means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our
outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203.

We do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock.

Notwithstanding the special cash dividend paid in October 2009, we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future.
The amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on
our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of
our common stock.

Our
common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol “TDG.” The following chart sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of the common stock on the NYSE.

Quarterly Stock Prices

Holders

We estimate that there were approximately 3,800 beneficial holders of our common stock as of November 11, 2009.

Dividends

There have been no cash dividends declared on any class of
common equity of TD Group for the two most recent fiscal years. In October 2009 TD Group’s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $7.65 on each outstanding share of common stock.

We do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Any payment of cash dividends on our
common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed
relevant by our Board of Directors. TD Group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries. Unless TD Group receives dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our
subsidiaries, TD Group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future. The ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our debt documents and may be limited by future debt or
other agreements that we may enter into.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We present below certain financial information
based on our EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined. References to “EBITDA” mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to “EBITDA As Defined” mean EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant
period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined presented below.



Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We present EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined because we believe they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity.

Our management believes that EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities
analysts, investors, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company’s ability to incur and service debt. In addition, EBITDA As Defined is useful to investors because our revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit
facility requires compliance, on a pro forma basis, with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our Consolidated EBITDA defined in the same manner as we define EBITDA As Defined
herein. This financial covenant is a material term of our senior secured credit facility as the failure to comply with such financial covenant could result in an event of default in respect of the revolving credit facility (and such an event of
default could, in turn, result in an event of default under the indenture governing our 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes).

In addition to the above, our
management uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections. Moreover, our management uses EBITDA As Defined
to evaluate acquisitions.

Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business
and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as
reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our
indebtedness;

•

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future,
and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;

•

the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As
Defined;

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and

•

EBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of
certain of our acquisitions.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined should not be
considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA or EBITDA As Defined in isolation and specifically by using other GAAP measures,
such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or
cash flow from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.



The information presented below should be read together with “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere herein.



(1)

Gross profit and operating income include the effect of charges relating to purchase accounting adjustments to inventory associated with the acquisition of various
businesses and product lines for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 of $2,264,000, $1,933,000, $6,392,000, $200,000, and $1,493,000, respectively.

(2)

The weighted-average common shares outstanding for the periods presented have been adjusted to give effect to the 149.6 for 1.00 stock split that occurred on
March 14, 2006 in connection with the initial public offering.

(3)

Net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding.

(4)

Net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. However, stock options totaling 0.1 million
outstanding at September 30, 2009 and 2008 and September 30, 2006, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2006 due to the anti-dilutive effect of such options.

(5)

On November 10, 2005, TransDigm Inc. paid a cash dividend of approximately $98.0 million to its then parent company, TransDigm Holding Company, and made bonus
payments of approximately $6.2 million to certain members of our management. TransDigm Holding Company used all of the proceeds received from TransDigm Inc. to pay a cash dividend to TD Group. On November 10, 2005, TD Group entered into a loan
facility and used the net proceeds received from the borrowings thereunder of approximately $193.8 million, together with substantially all of the proceeds received from the dividend payment from TransDigm Holding Company, to (i) prepay the
entire outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest on its 12% senior unsecured promissory notes issued in connection with acquisition of the Company by Warburg Pincus in July 2003, which payments in the aggregate were equal to
approximately $262.7 million, and (ii) make certain distributions to members of our management who participated in our deferred compensation plans, which distributions in the aggregate were equal to approximately $26.0 million.

(6)

For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of earnings before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest
expense, amortization of debt issuance costs and the portion (approximately 33%) of rental expense that management believes is representative of the interest component of rental expense.

(7)

EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA As Defined represents EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period,
certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined and the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined presented below. See “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures” for additional information and limitations regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “Selected Financial
Data” and TD Group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks
and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.

Overview

We
believe we are a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we
offer to our customers. Some of our more significant product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electromechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and
components, gear pumps, specialized valves, engineered connectors, power conditioning devices, specialized fluorescent lighting, specialized AC/DC electric motors, aircraft audio systems, engineered latches and cockpit security devices, lavatory
hardware and components, hold open rods and locking devices, specialized cockpit displays, elastomers, NiCad batteries and chargers, starter generators and related components. Each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that
are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer.

For fiscal year 2009, we generated
net sales of $761.6 million and net income of $162.9 million. In addition, for fiscal year 2009, our EBITDA was $362.9 million, or 47.7% of net sales, our EBITDA As Defined was $374.7 million, or 49.2% of net sales, and our
capital expenditures were $13.2 million, or 1.7% of net sales. See “EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined” below for certain information regarding EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, including a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As
Defined and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined.

We estimate that
over 95% of our net sales for fiscal year 2009 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design. These products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers (who often certify only one manufacturer’s
component design for a specific application on an aircraft), government agencies and/or the FAA and similar entities or agencies. In addition, for fiscal year 2009, we estimate that we generated approximately 80% of our net sales from products for
which we are the sole source provider.

Most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue. Once our parts are
designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft, we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft. This installed base and our sole source provider position generate a long-term stream of
aftermarket revenues over the estimated 30-year life of an individual aircraft. We estimate that approximately 60% of our net sales in fiscal year 2009 were generated from aftermarket sales, the vast majority of which come from the commercial and
military aftermarkets. These aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have been more stable than sales to OEMs.

In fiscal year 2009, our top two customers accounted for approximately 22% of our net sales, and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately 44% of our net sales. However,
our components are ultimately used on a large, diverse installed base of aircraft and, therefore, we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate end-users of our products. In the commercial
aerospace sector, which generated approximately 65% of our net sales for fiscal year 2009, we sell to distributors of aftermarket components, as well as directly to commercial airlines, aircraft maintenance facilities, systems suppliers, and
aircraft and engine OEMs. In addition, for fiscal year 2009, approximately 32% of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector. Net sales to the defense sector are generated



primarily through sales to the United States and foreign militaries, brokers, distributors and defense OEMs. The remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year 2009, or approximately 3%
of our net sales during this period, were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining and power generation industries.

Public Offerings

On May 25, 2007, certain of TD Group’s
stockholders, including certain members of our management, sold an aggregate of 11.5 million shares of TD Group’s common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $35.25 per share. TD Group did not sell any
shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering.

On March 20, 2006, certain stockholders of TD
Group and certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 12.6 million shares of TD Group’s common stock in the Initial Public Offering at a price of $21.00 per share. TD Group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale
in the initial public offering and TD Group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders. As a result of the initial public offering, TD Group’s common stock is publicly traded on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “TDG.”

Certain Acquisitions

Woodward HRT Product Line Acquisition

On August 10, 2009, TransDigm Inc., through its AeroControlex Group Inc. subsidiary, acquired certain product line assets of Woodward HRT, Inc., a subsidiary of Woodward Governor Company
(“Woodward HRT product line”) for approximately $48 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the level of working capital as of the closing date of the acquisition. The product line comprises a range of highly engineered fuel and
pneumatic valves and surge suppressors, the majority of which are used on military rotary and fixed wing aircraft, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. Woodward Governor recently acquired this business as part of
its acquisition of HR Textron, Inc.

Acme Aerospace Acquisition

On July 24, 2009, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Acme Aerospace, Inc. (“Acme”) for
approximately $40.7 million in cash, which includes a purchase price adjustment of $0.2 million paid in October 2009. Acme is a designer and manufacturer of proprietary, highly engineered components to the commercial aerospace industry, comprising
primarily fibrous nickel cadmium main ship batteries, battery chargers, battery back-up systems and power conversion equipment. These products fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction.

Aircraft Parts Corporation Acquisition

On December 16, 2008, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Aircraft Parts Corporation (“APC”) for approximately $66.9 million in cash, net of a purchase price
adjustment of $0.7 million received in November 2009. APC is a designer and manufacturer of starter generators, generator control units and related components for turbine engines, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business
direction.

Unison Product Line Acquisition

On September 26, 2008, TransDigm Inc., through its wholly-owned Champion Aerospace, LLC subsidiary, acquired certain assets related to the magneto and harness product line business of Unison
Industries, LLC (“Unison”) for approximately $68.3 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $1.1 million received



in November 2008. The acquired product line includes the highly engineered SLICK

TM

magnetos, harnesses and components, which are used on substantially all of the world’s general aviation piston
aircraft. These products fit well with Champion’s existing product offerings and TransDigm’s overall business direction.

CEF
Acquisition

On May 7, 2008, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of CEF Industries, Inc.
(“CEF”) for approximately $84.5 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $0.5 million received in January 2009. CEF is a designer and manufacturer of specialized and highly engineered actuators, pumps and related components
primarily for the military aerospace market, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction.

Bruce Acquisition

On August 10, 2007, TransDigm Inc., through a newly formed subsidiary, Bruce Aerospace Inc. (“Bruce”),
acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Bruce Industries for approximately $35.5 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $0.2 million received in February 2008. Bruce designs and manufactures specialized fluorescent
lighting used in the aircraft industry. The proprietary nature, established positions, and aftermarket content fit well with our overall business direction.

ATI Acquisition

On February 7, 2007, TransDigm Inc. acquired
all of the outstanding capital stock of Aviation Technologies, Inc. (“ATI”) for approximately $430 million in cash. ATI consists of two primary operating units that service the commercial and military aerospace markets – Avtech
Corporation (“Avtech”) and Transicoil LLC (which, together with Transicoil (Malaysia) Sendirian Berhad is referred to as “ADS/Transicoil”). Avtech is a supplier of flight deck and passenger audio systems, cabin lighting, and
power control products and related components. ADS/Transicoil is a supplier of displays, clocks, brushless motors and related components and instruments. Through Avtech and ADS/Transicoil, ATI manufactures proprietary products for the aerospace
industry with broad platform positions and high aftermarket content, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall direction.

The purchase price consideration and costs associated with the acquisition of $430.1 million were funded through additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility of $125.4 million (net of fees of $4.6 million), the proceeds
from the issuance by TransDigm Inc. of additional senior subordinated notes of $296.5 (net of fees of $6.5 million) and the use of $8.2 million of our available cash balances.

Mr. W. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TD Group, and Mr. Douglas Peacock, a director of TD Group, each
indirectly owned less than one-half of 1% of ATI’s outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis. In addition, prior to the acquisition, Mr. Howley and Mr. Peacock were directors of ATI commencing in 2003, and Mr. Peacock served as
ATI’s Chairman from 2003 through February 2007.

Trend Information

We
predominantly serve customers in the commercial, regional, business jet and general aviation aftermarket, which accounts for approximately 40% of total sales; the commercial aerospace OEM market, comprising large commercial transport manufacturers
and regional and business jet manufacturers, which accounts for approximately 25% of total sales; and the defense market, which accounts for approximately 32% of total sales. Non-aerospace sales comprise approximately 3% of our total sales.

The commercial aerospace industry, including the aftermarket and OEM market, is impacted by the health of the global economy
and geo-political events around the world. The commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles, or RPMs, between 2003 and 2008, as well as increases in OEM production and backlog, however, the global
economic downturn, airline capacity reductions and concerns over the financial credit markets have negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing RPMs to decline slightly in 2009. The defense aerospace market is dependent on
government budget constraints, the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts. It is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry.

Our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any
specific industry risk. We service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry, and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft, which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform. At
times, declines in sales in one sector have been offset by increased sales in another. However, due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to OEM and aftermarket customers, variation in product mix can cause variation in gross
margin.

There are many short-term factors (including inventory corrections, unannounced changes in order patterns, strikes
and mergers and acquisitions) that can cause short-term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years. To normalize for short-term fluctuations, we tend to look at our performance
over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet short-term periods. As such, it can be difficult to determine longer-term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons.

There are also fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter-to-quarter, as well as variations in product
mix from quarter-to-quarter, that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial OEMs. Again, in many instances these are
timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators.



Commercial Aftermarket

The key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide RPMs and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of
aircraft. Although RPMs increased annually between 2003 and 2008, industry consensus indicates that 2009 will have had negative growth as a result of expected reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy. Industry
reports expect RPMs to stabilize in 2010 and return to positive growth thereafter.

Commercial OEM Market

There is industry consensus that aircraft deliveries in the large commercial transport market sector (aircraft with 100 or more seats) may
reach its peak in 2009. However, there are conflicting industry opinions regarding the level of future deliveries, but we believe deliveries may be flat or decrease going forward. Another indicator of future OEM sales in this market is the order
backlog at The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S. Despite a significant number of airplanes in the backlog, current year orders for new airplanes have decreased from the prior year and the availability of financing is uncertain due to the current
state of the credit markets. Furthermore, the business jet OEM market significantly declined in 2009 and is expected to continue to decrease in the near future. This market has also been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth,
corporate profits, commodity prices and stock market returns across the world.

Defense

In recent years, defense spending has reached historic highs, due in part to the military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on
terrorism. Our military business fluctuates from year to year, and is dependent, to a degree, on government budget constraints, the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts. We anticipate that military related sales of our types of
products will be flat in 2010 over the current high levels.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which often requires the judgment of management in the
selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However,
investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.

We have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends. These critical policies
were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. Our most critical accounting policies are as follows:

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances:

Substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the
customer, at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer. Substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. Provisions for returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs
under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. We have a history of
making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances; however, due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material.

Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness. The
allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. Management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for
estimated losses based on historical information. The



determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. If circumstances change or economic conditions
deteriorate, management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts.

The Company provides limited warranties in
connection with the sale of its products. The warranty period for products sold varies throughout the Company’s operations, ranging from 90 days to six years. In addition, certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions.
The Company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources. The Company also provides a general amount based on historical
results. Historically, actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods for all locations except CEF,
which determines the cost of inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Because the Company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 30 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while
the airframes are in use. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels, past usage and future sales forecasts. Although management believes that the Company’s estimates of
obsolete and slow-moving inventory are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. In addition, in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as
current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year.

Intangible Assets:

Mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit
of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Company’s intent to do so. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates. The determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the Company’s strategic
plans and long-range planning forecasts. The revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and Company specific data. The profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and
anticipated cost changes. If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required. Intangible assets, such as
goodwill, trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized. All other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the Company. Substantially
all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction, and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for
purposes of the impairment assessment. Certain of the acquisitions were or are being integrated into an existing operating subsidiary, and therefore any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary.

Stock Options and Deferred Compensation Plans:

The Company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with GAAP

,

which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options’ vesting periods. Compensation
expense is recorded over the service period using the straight-line method for service-based awards and in the service period corresponding to the performance target for performance-based awards. In addition, the Company accounts for its deferred
compensation plans by recording the cost of deferred compensation arrangements over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner.



Purchase accounting:

Our mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the
purchase method. Accordingly, fair value adjustments to the Company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of
the merger or acquisition. We generally use third-party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments.

Results of
Operations

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data of the Company, including
presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales, (amounts in thousands):

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008

Net Sales.

Net sales increased by $47.8 million, or 6.7%, to $761.5 million for fiscal year 2009 from $713.7
million for fiscal year 2008. Sales of $64.7 million resulted from the acquisitions of CEF and the Unison product line in fiscal 2008 as well as the recent acquisitions of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme and the Woodward HRT product line.

Sales declined excluding acquisitions by $16.9 million or 2.4% from the prior year. The organic sales decline was primarily
due to: (i) a decrease of $30.4 million of commercial OEM sales resulting primarily from the impact of the significant decline in production rates in the business jet market resulting from the continued impact of global economic conditions
negatively impacting the business jet market and a reduction in sales to The Boeing Company due to its employee strike, and (ii) a decrease of $20.1 million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the impact of the global economic downturn
resulting in a decline in worldwide airline traffic and business jet activity. Partially offsetting the decline in organic commercial sales was an increase of $37.9 million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for OEM and aftermarket
spare parts and repairs across most of our product lines.

Cost of Sales

.

Cost of sales increased by $4.4
million, or 1.4%, to $332.2 million for fiscal year 2009 from $327.8 from fiscal year 2008. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 43.6% for fiscal year 2009 from 45.9% for fiscal year 2008. The increase in cost of sales was primarily
due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of $47.8 million discussed above and higher acquisition-related costs of $3.4 million. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due the strength of the
Company’s proprietary products, productivity improvements from continued cost reduction efforts and favorable product mix partially offset by the dilutive impact from recent acquisitions and higher acquisition-related costs.

Selling and Administrative Expenses.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by $5.4 million or 7.2%, to $80.0 million,
10.5% of net sales, for fiscal year 2009 from $74.6 million, or 10.5% of net sales, for fiscal year 2008. This increase was primarily due to the higher sales discussed above.



Amortization of Intangibles.

Amortization of intangibles increased by $1.9 million to
$13.9 million for fiscal year 2009 from $12.0 million for fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the recent acquisitions discussed above.

Income from Operations.

Operating income increased by $36.1 million, or 12.1%, to $335.4 million for fiscal year 2009 from $299.3 million for fiscal year 2008, primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above.

Interest Expense-Net

.

Interest expense decreased $8.3 million, or 8.9%, to $84.4 million for fiscal year
2009 from $92.7 million for fiscal year 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a reduction in interest income of $4.5 million. The Company’s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately $1.36
billion during both fiscal 2009 and 2008 year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately 6.0% during fiscal 2009 from 6.9% for the comparable period last year (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below).

Income Taxes

.

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 35.1% for fiscal year
2009 compared to 35.6% for fiscal year 2008. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the research and development tax credit.

Net Income.

Net income increased $29.8 million, or 22.4%, to $162.9 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to $133.1 million for fiscal year 2008, primarily as a result of the factors referred to
above.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2007

Net Sales.

Net sales increased by $120.9 million, or 20.4%, to $713.7 million for fiscal year 2008 from $592.8 million for fiscal year
2007. Sales growth excluding acquisitions was $51.9 million and represented an 8.8% increase over the prior year. The organic sales growth was primarily due to: (i) an increase of $24.5 million of military sales primarily resulting from
increased demand for aftermarket spare parts across most of our product lines; (ii) an increase of $16.5 million of commercial OEM sales primarily resulting from an increase in production rates from The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S. and
related OEM suppliers; and (iii) an increase of $10.2 million of commercial aftermarket sales despite being negatively impacted by an increase in the replacement time period for certain cockpit security components, as well as, modest system
wide inventory fluctuations. The remaining $69.0 million increase in net sales resulted from the acquisition of of CEF in fiscal 2008 and the businesses of ATI and Bruce in fiscal 2007.

Cost of Sales

.

Cost of sales increased by $44.0 million, or 15.5%, to $327.8 million for fiscal year 2008 from $283.8
from fiscal year 2007. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 45.9% for fiscal year 2008 from 47.9% for fiscal year 2007. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of $120.9
million discussed above, partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease, or 1% of net sales, in acquisition-related costs. The decrease in acquisition-related expenses was primarily due to inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs
recorded in the prior year of $8.4 million related to the acquisitions of ATI and CDA partially offset by current year inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs of $2.3 million primarily related to the acquisitions of Bruce and
CEF.

The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due a decrease from acquisition-related costs
discussed above, the strength of the Company’s proprietary products and continued productivity efforts, partially offset by the impact from the acquisitions of ATI, Bruce and CEF.

Selling and Administrative Expenses.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by $11.8 million or 18.7%, to $74.7 million
for fiscal year 2008 from $62.9 million for fiscal year 2007. This increase was primarily due to the higher sales discussed above and an increase in research and development expenses of $3.5 million primarily relating to the Boeing 787 program,
partially offset by the non-recurring charge of $1.7 million relating to the secondary offering recorded in the prior year.



Amortization of Intangibles.

Amortization of intangibles decreased by $0.3 million to
$12.0 million for fiscal year 2008 from $12.3 million for fiscal year 2007.

Income from Operations.

Operating income
increased by $65.4 million, or 28.0%, to $299.2 million for fiscal year 2008 from $233.8 million for fiscal year 2007, primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above.

Interest Expense-Net

.

Interest expense increased $0.9 million, or 1.0%, to $92.7 million for fiscal year 2008 from
$91.8 million for fiscal year 2007 due to an increase in our debt of approximately $430 million from the acquisition ATI in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest rates and higher interest income of $2.3 million. The Company’s
weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately $1.36 billion during fiscal 2008 compared to approximately $1.20 billion during the comparable period last year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately 6.9% during
fiscal 2008 from 7.6% for the comparable period last year (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below).

Income
Taxes

.

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 35.6% for fiscal year 2008 compared to 37.6% for fiscal year 2007. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in state and
local taxes, an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of a prior year IRS audit and state tax refund of $1.2 million partially offset by a lower research and development tax credit.

Net Income.

Net income increased $44.5 million, or 50.2%, to $133.1 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to $88.6 million for fiscal
year 2007, primarily as a result of the factors referred to above.

Backlog

As of September 30, 2009, the Company estimated its sales order backlog at $402 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of
$418 million as of September 30, 2008. This decrease in backlog of $16 million is mainly due to lower commercial OEM and aftermarket demand including the impact of order cancellations and pushouts as well as significant reductions in business
jet production rates. These declines were partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme and the Woodward HRT product line. The majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of September 30, 2009 are
scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months. Purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment. The level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing
of the Company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, the Company’s backlog as of September 30, 2009 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any
future period.

Foreign Operations

Although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the United States, we manufacture some products in Malaysia through our wholly-owned Malaysian subsidiary. We sell our products in the United
States, as well as in foreign countries. Substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in U.S. dollars and, therefore, we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar as a
result of foreign sales. In addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers, including our Malaysian manufacturing subsidiary, are not material, with substantially all such transactions
being made in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar arising from these transactions.

Our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $150.4 million, $144.3 million, and $143.0 million for fiscal years 2009,
2008, and 2007, respectively. Sales to foreign customers are subject to



numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign
governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the Company within such governments’ countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance
that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy.

Inflation

Many of the Company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of
inflation, which could result in changing operating costs. The effects of inflation on the Company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 were not significant.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating Activities.

The Company
generated $197.1 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2009 compared to $189.6 million generated during fiscal 2008. The increase of $7.5 million in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to an increase in net income of $29.8 million
partially offset by the payout of the deferred compensation liability of $6.2 and the change in income taxes receivable (including the impact of the excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options) of $12.8 million.

The Company generated $189.6 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2008 compared to $112.4 million generated during fiscal
2008. The increase of $77.2 million in fiscal 2008 is primarily due to an increase in net income of $44.5 million and favorable changes in accounts receivable and inventory of approximately $31.0 million.

Investing Activities.

Cash used in investing activities was $168.4 million during fiscal 2009 consisting of the acquisitions of the
businesses of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme and Woodward HRT product lines for a total of $155.2 million and capital expenditures of $13.2 million.

Cash used in investing activities was $165.0 million during fiscal 2008 consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of CEF and Unison for a total of $154.1 million and capital expenditures of $10.9
million.

Cash used in investing activities was $521.7 million during fiscal 2007 consisting of the acquisitions of the
businesses of ATI, CDA, and Bruce for a total of $511.4 million and capital expenditures of $10.3 million.

Financing
Activities.

Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 was $2.4 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $28.5 million in fiscal 2008. The cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 related to the
exercise of stock options of $17.6 million partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock for $15.2 million.

Cash
provided by financing activities during fiscal 2008 of $28.5 million related to the exercise of stock options.

Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2007 of $454.0 million consisted of the proceeds received of $296.5 million, net of fees, from the issuance of additional 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and additional term loans of $125.4
million, net of fees, to finance the acquisition of ATI and $32.1 million related to the exercise of stock options.

Description of
Current Senior Secured Credit Facility and Indenture

In June 2006 TransDigm refinanced its entire debt structure. In
connection with the refinancing, TransDigm Inc. obtained a new senior secured credit facility. The senior secured credit facility consisted of a $650 million term loan facility, which was fully drawn at closing, and a $150 million revolving loan
facility. In addition, under



the terms of the senior secured credit facility, TransDigm Inc. had the right to request (but no lender was committed to provide) additional term loans of up to $250 million, subject to the
satisfaction of customary conditions, including pro forma compliance with the financial covenant contained in the senior secured credit facility after giving effect to any such incremental term loan borrowings.

In connection with the acquisition of ATI in February 2007, TransDigm Inc. entered into an amendment of the senior secured credit facility,
which provided for, among other things, (i) an additional term loan of $130 million, (ii) a $50 million increase in the revolving credit facility (bringing the total available revolver to $200 million), and (iii) a $50 million
increase in the uncommitted incremental loan facility to $300 million. At September 30, 2009, $198.0 million of the revolving credit facility was available.

The term loan facility will mature in June 2013 and is not subject to interim scheduled amortization, but is subject to certain prepayment requirements. Under the amended terms of the senior secured
credit facility, commencing 90 days after the end of fiscal 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, TransDigm Inc. is required to prepay outstanding term loans in a principal amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the senior secured
credit facility); provided that the amount of the prepayment will be reduced to 25% of Excess Cash Flow if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the end of the applicable fiscal year is less than 5.00 to 1.00, but greater than 4.50 to 1.00. TransDigm
Inc. will not be required to prepay any of the term loans if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal year is equal to or less than 4.50 to 1.00 or if the term loans achieve certain minimum credit ratings at the end of
such fiscal year. “Excess Cash Flow” is a negotiated definition generally designed to capture the cash that was generated by our business in excess of cash used in the business. “Consolidated Leverage Ratio” means the ratio of
consolidated total indebtedness to the aggregate amount of EBITDA As Defined, calculated on a pro forma basis. TransDigm’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 3.5 to 1.00 at September 30, 2009, thus the Company was not obligated
to make a prepayment of the term loans based upon the Excess Cash Flow provision.

In addition, subject to exceptions
(including reinvestment in productive assets), TransDigm Inc. is required to offer to prepay the term loans with the net proceeds of certain asset sales. The revolving loan facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in June
2012.

The senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by TD Group and all of TransDigm Inc.’s current and future
domestic restricted subsidiaries, and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of TransDigm Inc. and all of TransDigm Inc.’s existing and future domestic restricted
subsidiaries, and a first priority pledge of the capital stock of TransDigm Inc. and TransDigm Inc.’s domestic subsidiaries.

The interest rates per annum applicable to loans, other than swingline loans, under the senior secured credit facility are, at the Company’s option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three or
six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine or twelve month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm Inc., in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. The alternate base rate is the greater of (1) Credit Suisse’s prime
rate or (2) 50 basis points over the weighted average rates on overnight Federal funds as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The adjusted LIBO rate is determined by reference to settlement rates established for deposits in
dollars in the London interbank market for a period equal to the interest period of the loan as adjusted for the maximum reserve percentages established by the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve. The applicable margin percentage
is a percentage per annum equal to (1) 1.00% for alternate base rate term loans, (2) 2.00% for adjusted LIBO rate term loans, (3) in the case of alternate base rate revolving loans and adjusted LIBO rate revolving loans, a percentage
which varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio of TransDigm Inc. as of the relevant date of determination.

TransDigm
Inc. entered into a three year interest rate swap in June 2006 with Credit Suisse for an initial notional amount of $187 million at a fixed rate of 7.63%. The notional amount decreased to $150 million on September 23, 2008, and the swap
agreement expired on June 23, 2009. TransDigm Inc. entered into an additional three year interest rate swap in January 2008 with Credit Suisse for the notional amount of $300 million at a fixed rate of 5.0% through March 2011.



In connection with the refinancing, TransDigm Inc. also issued $275
million aggregate principal amount of 7

% Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result of the acquisition of ATI,
TransDigm Inc. issued an additional $300 million aggregate principal amount of 7

%
Senior Subordinated Notes under the Indenture dated as of June 23, 2006.

Such notes do not require
principal payments prior to their maturity in July 2014. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally and on an unsecured senior subordinated basis, by TD Group and all of our existing domestic subsidiaries.

Upon the closing of the ATI acquisition, the additional term loan of $130 million, together with the net proceeds
from the $300 million from the additional 7

balances, was drawn to fund the approximately $430 million purchase price of ATI.

% Senior Subordinated Notes that were issued and sold by TransDigm in June 2006 and February 2007.

The proceeds from the issuance of the New 7

used to make a cash distribution to TD Group, which paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately $375 million, made dividend equivalent payments to its holders of stock options of approximately $30 million and paid for
transaction-related fees and expenses.

Certain Restrictive Covenants in Our Debt Documents

Both the senior secured credit facility and the Indentures contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of other indebtedness. In addition, the revolving loan
facility under the senior secured credit facility requires TransDigm Inc. to comply with a first lien leverage ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the
senior secured credit facility or the Indentures. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7

have to provide further borrowings In addition, following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes
our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7

Stock
Repurchase Program

In October 2008 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares
not to exceed $50 million in the aggregate. During 2009, we repurchased under this program 494,100 shares of at an aggregate cost of approximately $15.2 million.



Contractual Obligations

The following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2009 (in millions):

(1)

The senior secured credit facility will mature on June 23, 2013 and will not be subject to interim scheduled amortization.

(2)

Assumes that the variable interest rate on our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility remains constant at 5.2%.

In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, the Company issued $425 of New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. The annual scheduled interest
payments under the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated
Notes will be approximately $33 million. Also, the Company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and, from time to time, for facility expansion. Capital expenditures totaled
approximately $13.2 million, $10.9 million, and $10.3 million during fiscal 2009, 2008, and fiscal 2007, respectively. The Company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 to be between $15 million and $20 million and such expenditures are
projected to increase moderately thereafter.

The Company intends to pursue acquisitions that present
opportunities consistent with the Company’s business direction. The Company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate
an agreement with respect to any future acquisition. The Company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all. If
the Company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions, total interest expense will increase.

If the Company has excess
cash, it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend, prepayment of indebtedness, repurchase of stock, or other means. In October 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million, in the aggregate, of the Company’s common stock. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased a total of 494,100 shares at an aggregate cost of $15.2 million. Whether the Company undertakes
additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. In addition,
the Company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so.

The Company’s ability
to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the Company’s indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the Company’s ability to generate cash in the
future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control. Based on its current levels of operations and anticipated cost savings and operating improvements and absent
any disruptive events, management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations, non-acquisition related capital expenditures,
research and development efforts and long-term indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2010. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated
cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future



borrowings will be available to the Company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs. The Company
may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity. Also, to the extent the Company accelerates its growth plans, consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses, the Company may
also need to raise additional capital. In particular, increased working capital needs occur whenever the Company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise
additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

New Accounting Standards

New Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2009

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance codifying GAAP. While the guidance was not intended to change GAAP, it did change the way the
Company references these accounting principles in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of this
authoritative guidance as of September 30, 2009 changed how it references GAAP in its disclosures.

In May 2009, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of accounting and disclosures for events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before financial statements are issued. Application of this authoritative guidance was required for
interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of this guidance during fiscal 2009 resulted in additional disclosures. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with GAAP, and also expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for
the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The adoption of this guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective October 1, 2008 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, at various dates the FASB has issued authoritative guidance requiring additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments and derivatives and hedging activities that were
effective for the Company during fiscal 2009. The Company’s adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosures. See Notes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, contingent consideration, and certain acquired contingencies to be measured at
their fair values as of the date of acquisition. This guidance also requires that acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business combination. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008 and is therefore applicable to the Company effective October 1, 2009. The implementation of this guidance will affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position after its effective
date only to the extent it completes applicable business combinations subsequent to the effective date and, therefore, the impact of this guidance cannot be determined prior to the completion of any applicable business combination transactions.

Additional Disclosure Required by Indenture

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At
September 30, 2009, we had borrowings under our senior secured credit facility of $780 million that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either
an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly,
the Company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in
interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our senior secured credit facility by approximately $7.8 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2009. The weighted average interest rate on the $780
million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility on September 30, 2009 was 2.3%.

At September 30,
2009, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our senior secured credit facility for fixed interest rates through March 23, 2011 for the notional amount of $300 million. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement
is adjusted at each balance sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was a liability of $7.8 million.

The fair value of the $780 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the senior secured credit facility is
exposed to the market risk of interest rates. The estimated fair value of such term loan approximated $749 million at September 30, 2009 based upon information provided to the Company from its agent under the credit facility. The fair value of
the $575 million aggregate principal amount of our 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes. The estimated fair value of such notes approximated $571 million at September 30, 2009 based upon quoted market rates.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and
Procedures

As of September 30, 2009, TD Group carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of TD Group’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of TD Group’s
disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that TD Group’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by TD Group in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange



Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to TD Group’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, TD Group’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of TD Group is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Using criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, TransDigm’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2009. Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2009.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have issued an audit report on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting of the Company as of September 30, 2009. This report is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in TD Group’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, TD Group’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

TransDigm Group Incorporated

We have audited TransDigm Group Incorporated’s internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). TransDigm Group
Incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, TransDigm Group Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of TransDigm Group Incorporated and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2009 and our report dated November 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Options issued outside of the 2003 stock option plan and the 2006 stock incentive plan.

2003 Stock Option Plan

In connection with the acquisition of the Company
by Warburg Pincus in 2003, TD Group adopted a stock option plan for the benefit of our employees. The stock option plan has been amended and restated on several occasions, most recently effective as of July 18, 2008 and we refer to such stock
option plan as it is currently in effect as the 2003 stock option plan.

Upon the closing of the acquisition of the Company by
Warburg Pincus, certain employees rolled over certain then-existing options to purchase shares of common stock of TransDigm Holding Company with an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $35.7 million into a combination of options to
purchase shares of common stock of TD Group, or rollover options, and interests in the two deferred compensation plans which have since been terminated. These employees were granted rollover options to purchase an aggregate of 3,870,152 shares of TD
Group common stock, which gives effect to the 149.60 for 1.00 stock split that we effected on March 14, 2006 in connection with our initial public offering. All rollover options granted in



connection with the closing of the acquisition were fully vested on the date of grant. As of September 30, 2009, there were rollover options to purchase 174,795 shares of TD Group common
stock issued and outstanding (after giving effect to the stock split).

In addition to the shares of TD Group common stock
reserved for issuance upon exercise of rollover options, under the terms of the 2003 stock option plan, an aggregate of 5,469,301 shares of TD Group common stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of new management options (after giving effect
to the stock split). As of September 30, 2009, there were new management options to purchase 3,262,586 shares of TD Group common stock issued and outstanding (after giving effect to the stock split). As of September 30, 2009, there were
76,857 shares available for issuance under options not yet granted.

2006 Stock Incentive Plan

Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, TD Group adopted a new stock incentive plan, which was amended on October 20,
2006 and effective July 29, 2008, designed to assist us in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding key employees, directors or consultants, and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders of TD Group by closely aligning
the interests of these individuals with those of our stockholders. The 2006 stock incentive plan permits TD Group to award our key employees, directors or consultants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives. The total number
of shares of TD Group common stock available for issuance or delivery under the 2006 stock incentive plan is 1,277,271, subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, share exchange or
any other similar corporate transaction or event. As of September 30, 2009, there were 4,067 restricted shares issued and outstanding under the 2006 stock incentive plan. As of September 30, 2009, options to purchase 2,823,400 shares had
been issued thereunder.

In connection with the acquisition of the Company by Warburg Pincus, the Company issued 132,096
options to Michael Graff, a director of the Company. Because Mr. Graff was not an employee of the Company and because participation in the 2003 Stock Option Plan was limited to employees, the options were issued outside of the 2003 Stock Option
Plan. All of the options awarded to Mr. Graff are vested. As of September 30, 2009, 108,096 options remained outstanding and exercisable.

INDEX



TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

TransDigm Group Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TransDigm Group Incorporated and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2009
and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2009. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of TransDigm Group Incorporated and subsidiaries at September 30, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of TransDigm Group Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 24, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ACQUISITIONS

Woodward HRT Product Line

On August 10, 2009, TransDigm Inc., through its AeroControlex Group Inc. subsidiary, acquired certain product line assets of Woodward HRT, Inc., a subsidiary of Woodward
Governor Company (“Woodward HRT product line”) for approximately $48 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the level of working capital as of the closing date of the acquisition. The product line comprises a range of highly
engineered fuel and pneumatic valves and surge suppressors, the majority of which are used on military rotary and fixed wing aircraft, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. Woodward Governor recently acquired this

TM

magnetos, harnesses and components, which are used on substantially all of the world’s general aviation piston
aircraft. These products fit well with Champion’s existing product offerings and TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company expects that the $60 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax
purposes.

CEF

—

On May 7, 2008, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of CEF Industries, Inc. (“CEF”) for approximately $84.5 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $0.5 million received in January 2009. CEF is a designer and manufacturer of specialized and highly engineered actuators,
compressors, pumps and related components primarily for the military aerospace market, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company expects that the $52 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will
not be deductible for tax purposes.

Bruce

—

On August 10, 2007, TransDigm
Inc., through a newly formed subsidiary, Bruce Aerospace Inc. (“Bruce”), acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Bruce Industries for approximately $35.5 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $0.2
million received in February 2008. Additionally, in accordance with the purchase agreement, the Company recorded a contingent liability based upon the earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to the sale of certain part
numbers for a period of three years following the closing. Bruce designs and manufactures specialized fluorescent lighting used in the aircraft industry. The proprietary nature, established positions, and aftermarket content fit well with
TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company expects that the $24 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

ATI

—On February 7, 2007, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Aviation Technologies, Inc. (“ATI”) for approximately $430 million in cash. ATI
consists of two primary operating units that service the commercial and military aerospace markets—Avtech Corporation (“Avtech”) and Transicoil LLC (which, together with Transicoil (Malaysia) Sendirian Berhad, is referred to as
“ADS/Transicoil”). Avtech is a supplier of flight deck and passenger audio systems, cabin lighting, and power control products and related components. ADS/Transicoil is a supplier of displays, clocks, brushless motors and related
components and instruments. Through Avtech and ADS/Transicoil, ATI manufactures proprietary products for the aerospace industry with broad platform positions and high aftermarket content, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall
direction. Substantially all of the goodwill of $308 million recognized in accounting for the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Mr. W. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TransDigm, and Mr. Douglas Peacock, a director of TransDigm, each indirectly owned less than one-half of 1% of ATI’s
outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis. In addition, prior to the acquisition, Mr. Howley and Mr. Peacock were directors of ATI commencing in 2003, and Mr. Peacock served as ATI’s Chairman from 2003 through February 2007.

CDA

—

On October 3, 2006, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
CDA InterCorp (“CDA”) for $45.7 million in cash, which includes a purchase price adjustment of $0.3 million paid in March 2007. CDA designs and manufactures specialized controllable drive actuators, motors, transducers, and gearing. The
products are consistent with TransDigm’s recent acquisition of similar product lines. Goodwill of $34 million recognized in accounting for the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

F-7


The Company accounted for the acquisitions of the businesses of the Woodward HRT product
line, Acme, APC, the Unison product line, CEF, Bruce, ATI and CDA (collectively, the “Acquisitions”) as purchases and included the results of operations of the Acquisitions in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date
of each acquisition. The Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets of APC, Acme and the Woodward HRT product line; thus, the values attributed to acquired assets in the consolidated
financial statements are subject to adjustment. Pro forma net sales and results of operations for the Acquisitions, had the Acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the applicable fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 or 2008, are not
significant and, accordingly, are not provided.

The Acquisitions strengthen and expand the Company’s position to design,
produce and supply highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components in niche markets with significant aftermarket content and provide opportunities to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. The
purchase price paid for each acquisition reflects the current earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and cash flows, as well as, the future EBITDA and cash flows expected to be generated by the business, which are
driven in most cases by the recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of a particular aircraft, estimated to be approximately 30 years.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

—The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”) and include the accounts of TD Group and subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances

—The Company recognizes substantially all revenue based upon shipment of products to the customer, at which time title and risk of loss passes
to the customer. Substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. Provisions for estimated returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided
for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, it is possible that
actual results may vary from the estimates.

Shipping and Handling Costs

—

All shipping and
handling costs are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Research and Development
Costs

—The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. The expense recognized for research and development costs for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $12.6 million, $13.2 million,
and $9.6 million, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

—

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Uncollectible
Accounts

—

The Company reserves for amounts determined to be uncollectible based on specific identification of losses and estimated losses based on historical experience. The allowance also incorporates a provision for the
estimated impact of disputes with customers. The determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. If circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate
or improve, the allowance for doubtful accounts could increase or decrease.

Inventories

—

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods for all locations except CEF, which
determines the cost of inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Approximately 9% of the inventory was valued under the

F-8


LIFO method at September 30, 2009. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory is made based on management’s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts. In
accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives: land improvements from 10 to 20 years, buildings and improvements from 5 to 30 years, machinery and equipment from 2 to 10 years and furniture and fixtures from 3 to 10 years.

The Company assesses the potential impairment of its property by determining whether the carrying value of the property can be recovered
through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations over the property’s remaining estimated useful life. Any impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Debt Issue Costs, Premiums

and Discounts

—

The cost of obtaining financing as well as premiums
and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective obligations/securities.

Intangible Assets

—

Intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles acquired or recognized in accounting for the acquisitions (trademarks, trade names, technology, order backlog and a license agreement)
and goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment testing. The Company’s annual impairment test is performed as of its fiscal year end. Management determines fair value using a
discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.

GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim,
impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the Company. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the
accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction, and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment. Certain of the acquisitions were or are being
integrated into an existing operating subsidiary, and therefore any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary.

A two-step impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting
unit (as defined) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired, and the second step of the goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. The second
step measures the amount of impairment, if any, by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill associated with a reporting unit to the implied fair value of the goodwill derived from the estimated overall fair value of the reporting unit and the
individual fair values of the other assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.

The impairment test for indefinite lived
intangible assets consists of a comparison between their fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount
equal to the sum of any such excesses.

The Company assesses the recoverability of its amortizable intangible assets by
determining whether the amortization over their remaining lives can be recovered through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations.

Stock Option and Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company records stock-based compensation measured using the fair value method of accounting. Compensation expense is recorded over the
service period using the straight-line method for service-based awards and in the service period corresponding to the performance target for performance-based awards. Beginning in fiscal 2009, stock-based compensation expense was adjusted for
projected forfeitures based on historical experience.

The Company accounts for its deferred compensation plans by recording
the cost of deferred compensation arrangements over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner.

F-9


Income Taxes

—

The Company accounts for income taxes using an
asset and liability approach. Deferred taxes are recorded for the difference between the book and tax basis of various assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset
will not be realized.

On October 1, 2007, the Company adopted authoritative guidance establishing the minimum accounting
and disclosure requirements of uncertain tax positions. The Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $1.7 million, increasing its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties and reducing the October 1, 2007
balance of retained earnings.

Contingencies

—

During the ordinary course of business, the
Company is from time to time threatened with, or may become a party to, legal actions and other proceedings. While the Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings, it believes the results of these proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company believes that its potential exposure to such legal actions is adequately covered by its aviation product and general liability insurance.

Estimates

—

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

—

The term “comprehensive income (loss)” represents the change in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events and circumstances resulting from non-stockholder sources. The
Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, consisting principally of its interest rate swaps, is reported separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, net of taxes of $3.4
million, ($0.1) million, and $1.1 million as of September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Reporting

—

Management evaluates the Company as one reporting segment in the aerospace industry. The Company is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of highly
engineered aircraft components used in aerospace and defense applications through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Substantially all of the Company’s operations are located within the United States.

Earnings per Share

—

Basic earnings per share information is determined using the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share information includes the additional effect of potentially dilutive securities, which comprise stock options outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of stock options
is calculated using the treasury stock method.

Reclassifications

—

Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified within current liabilities to conform to the current year presentation. The changes were made for disclosure purposes only and did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

New Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2009

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance codifying GAAP. While the guidance was not intended to change GAAP, it did change the way the Company references these accounting principles in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This
guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of this authoritative guidance as of September 30, 2009 changed how it references GAAP in its disclosures.

In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of accounting and disclosures for events
that occur after the balance sheet date, but before financial statements are issued.

F-10


Application of this authoritative guidance was required for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of this guidance during fiscal 2009
resulted in additional disclosures. See Note 21.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and also expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The adoption of this guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective
October 1, 2008 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 17.

In addition, at various dates the FASB has issued authoritative guidance requiring additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments and derivatives and hedging activities that were
effective for the Company during fiscal 2009. The Company’s adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosures. See Notes 17 and 18.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
requiring assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, contingent consideration, and certain acquired contingencies to be measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. This guidance also requires that acquisition-related
costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business combination. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is therefore applicable to the Company effective
October 1, 2009. The implementation of this guidance will affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position after its effective date only to the extent it completes applicable business combinations subsequent to the
effective date and, therefore, the impact of this guidance cannot be determined prior to the completion of any applicable business combination transactions.

DEBT

The Company’s
long-term debt consists of the following at September 30 (in thousands):

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans

—TransDigm Inc.’s
Senior Secured Credit Facility totals $980 million, which consists of (1) a $200 million revolving credit line maturing in June 2012 and (2) a $780 million term loan facility maturing in June 2013. The interest rate on the term loans at
September 30, 2009 was 2.3%. At September 30, 2009, the Company had $2.0 million letters of credit outstanding and $198.0 million of borrowings available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $300 million which effectively converts the variable rate interest
on the notional amount of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 3.04% plus the 2% margin percentage, over the term of the agreement.

The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, or six-month (or to
the extent available to each lender, nine or twelve month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm Inc. in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. The alternate base rate is the greater of (1) Credit Suisse’s prime rate or
(2) 50 basis points over the weighted average of rates on overnight Federal funds as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The adjusted LIBO rate is determined by reference to settlement rates established for deposits in dollars in
the London interbank market for a period equal to the interest period of the loan as adjusted for the maximum reserve percentages established by the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve. The applicable margin percentage is a
percentage per annum equal to (1) 1.00% for alternate base rate term loans, (2) 2.00% for adjusted LIBO rate term loans, and (3) in the case of alternate base rate revolving loans and adjusted LIBO rate revolving loans, a percentage
which varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio of TransDigm Inc. as of the relevant date of determination.

F-15


Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay the
administrative agent certain fees. In addition, on the last day of each calendar quarter the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% of any unused commitments under the revolving credit line and certain other fees in respect of letters
of credit that may be outstanding thereunder from time to time.

The term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility is
subject to mandatory prepayments of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the agreement) if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 4.50 to 1.00 for the Company’s fiscal year or if the term loans do not achieve certain minimum credit ratings at the
end of such fiscal year. “Consolidated Leverage Ratio” means the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to the aggregate amount of EBITDA As Defined, calculated on a pro forma basis. TransDigm’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was
approximately 3.5 to 1.00 at September 30, 2009, thus the Company was not obligated to make the prepayment of the term loans based upon the excess cash flow provision.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by TD Group and all of TransDigm Inc.’s current and future domestic restricted
subsidiaries, and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future property and assets, including inventory, equipment, general intangibles, intellectual property, investment property and other
personal property (but excluding leasehold interests, deposit accounts and certain other assets) of TransDigm Inc. and all of TransDigm Inc.’s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, and a first priority pledge of the capital
stock of TransDigm Inc. and TransDigm Inc.’s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting capital stock of TransDigm Inc.’s foreign subsidiaries.

The agreement also contains a number of restrictive covenants restricting or limiting the ability of TD Group, TransDigm
Inc. and TransDigm Inc.’s direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or
repurchase our subordinated debt, make investments, sell assets, enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us, incur liens, consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our
assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, create unrestricted subsidiaries, and engage in certain business activities. Such negative covenants are subject to certain exceptions. The negative covenants are substantially identical to the
corresponding negative covenants of the 7

%
Senior Subordinated Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility includes a financial maintenance covenant requiring that TransDigm comply, on a pro forma basis, with a consolidated secured debt ratio test. Such covenant, however, inures
only to the benefit of the revolving lenders. TransDigm is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, which together cover certain union employees. The plans provide benefits of stated
amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute actuarially determined amounts allowable under Internal Revenue Service regulations. The Company uses a September 30

th

measurement date for its defined benefit pension plans.

The plan assets as of September 30, 2009 and 2008 were $6.7 million. The Company’s accumulated benefit obligation for its
defined benefit pension plans was $8.0 million as of September 30, 2009 and 2008. The total liability recognized at September 30, 2009 and 2008 was $1.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The net period pension cost recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Income as of September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Defined Contribution Plans

—The Company sponsors certain defined contribution employee savings plans that cover substantially all of the Company’s non-union employees. Under the
plans, the Company contributes a percentage of employee compensation and matches a portion of employee contributions. The cost recognized for such contributions for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $2.4
million, $2.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—Prior to 2005 the
Company maintained two deferred compensation plans of TD Group for certain management personnel of the Company. In 2005, TD Group adopted the TD Holding Corporation 2005 New Management Deferred Compensation Plan (the “New Management Deferred
Compensation Plan”) for the benefit of certain management personnel of the Company who were granted new management options under the TD Group 2003 stock option plan. The New Management Deferred Compensation Plan, along with a deferred
compensation arrangement for one employee who was not an executive officer, provide that a participant’s deferred compensation account is fully distributed upon the earlier of: December 31, 2008 or a Change in Control (as defined in the
plan). The cost of the plans totaled $0.3 million, $2.2 million and $2.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The obligations under the New Management Deferred Compensation Plan and the additional
employee deferred compensation arrangement represent obligations of TD Group and are not guaranteed by TransDigm Inc. or any of its subsidiaries.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and local jurisdictions.
During the fourth quarter of the Company’s fiscal 2009 year, the Internal Revenue Service informed the Company that they will be conducting an examination of the Company’s 2008 fiscal year. In addition, the Company is subject to state and
local income tax examinations for fiscal years 2005 through 2009.

Unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2009 and 2008, the recognition of
which would have an effect on the effective tax rate for each fiscal year, amounted to $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The Company classifies all income tax related interest and penalties as income tax expense. During the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in income tax interest and penalties. As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, the Company accrued $1.1 million and $0.9 million,
respectively, for the potential payment of interest and penalties. The Company anticipates no significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits through fiscal 2010.

—Authorized capital stock of TD Group consists of 224,400,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock and 149,600,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock. The total number of shares of common stock
outstanding at September 30, 2009 and 2008 was 49,448,028 and 48,600,848, respectively. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at September 30, 2009 and 2008. The terms of the preferred stock have not been established.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock compensation plans are designed to assist the Company in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding key employees, directors or consultants, and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders by
closely aligning the interests of these individuals with those of the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s stock compensation plans provide for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives.

The following table shows the expense recognized by the Company for stock-based compensation (in thousands):

F-19


The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $10.45, $13.66 and $10.16, respectively.

As of September 30, 2009, there was
$23.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards expected to vest, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of four years.

The fair value of the Company’s employee stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for all
options granted during the fiscal years ended:

The risk-free interest rate is based upon the Treasury bond rates as of the grant
date. The average expected life of stock-based awards is based on vesting schedules and contractual terms. Expected volatility of stock was calculated using a rate based upon the historical volatility of publicly traded companies in the
Company’s peer group in the aerospace industry. This was used because TD Group’s common stock has only been publicly traded since March 2006. The Company historically has not paid regular cash dividends and does not anticipate paying
regular cash dividends in future periods; thus, no dividend rate assumption is used.

The total fair value of shares vested
during fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $4.9 million, $5.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

2006 Stock Incentive Plan

In conjunction with the consummation of the initial public offering, a 2006
stock incentive plan was adopted by TD Group. In July 2008, the plan was amended to increase the number of shares available for issuance thereunder. TD Group has reserved 4,119,668 shares of its common stock for issuance to key employees, directors
or consultants under the plan. Awards under the plan may be in the form of options, restricted stock or other stock-based awards. Options granted under the plan will expire no later than the tenth anniversary of the applicable date of grant of the
options, and will have an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock granted under the plan vests over three years.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, 3,164 shares of commons stock were issued with a weighted-average grant date fair
value of $37.89.

September 30, 2009 under the 2006 stock incentive plan have been pursuant to an equity incentive program adopted by the Company in 2008. Under the 2008 equity incentive program, all of the options granted will vest based on the Company’s
achievement of established operating performance goals. The following table summarizes the activity, pricing and other information for the Company’s performance vested stock-based award activity during the fiscal year ended September 30,
2009:

At September 30, 2009, 1,277,271 remaining shares were available for award under
TD Group’s 2006 stock incentive plan.

2003 Stock Option Plan

Certain executives and key employees of the Company were granted stock options under TD Group’s 2003 stock option plan. Upon the closing
of the acquisition of the Company by Warburg Pincus in 2003, certain employees rolled over certain then-existing options to purchase shares of common stock of TransDigm Holdings. These employees were granted rollover options to purchase an aggregate
of 3,870,152 shares of common stock of TD Group (after giving effect to the 149.60 for 1.00 stock split effected on March 14, 2006). All rollover options granted were fully vested on the date of grant. In addition to shares of common stock
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of rollover options, an aggregate of 5,469,301 shares of TD Group’s common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of new management options. In general, approximately 20% of all new management
options vested based on employment service or a change in control. These time vested options have a graded vesting schedule of up to four years. Approximately 80% of all new management options vested (i) based upon the satisfaction of specified
performance criteria, which is annual and cumulative EBITDA As Defined targets through 2008, or (ii) upon the occurrence of a change in control if the Investor Group (defined as Warburg Pincus and the other initial investors in TD Group)
received a minimum specified rate of return. Unless terminated earlier, the options expire ten years from the date of grant. All of the outstanding performance options were vested as of September 30, 2009.

TD Group has reserved a total of 9,339,453 shares of its common stock for issuance to the Company’s employees under the plan, 9,262,596
of which had been issued as of September 30, 2009.

In addition to the stock options issued under the
2003 stock option plan and 2006 stock incentive plan, two members of the Company’s Board of Directors were also been granted stock options of TD Group. Of the 134,040 options issued under these agreements, 108,096 remain outstanding with an
exercise price of $6.68. All of such options were vested as of September 30, 2009.

Dividend Equivalent Plans

Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated TransDigm Group Incorporated 2003 Stock Option Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan and the Second
Amended and Restated TransDigm Group Incorporated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan, all of the options granted under the 2003 stock option plan and the 2006 stock incentive plan are entitled to certain dividend equivalent payments
in the event of the declaration of a dividend by the Company. Options granted outside the plans to directors are also entitled to comparable dividend equivalents. No dividends had been declared prior to September 30, 2009 and so no dividend
equivalents had been paid. The Company declared a special dividend of $7.65 per share in October 2009. See Note 21. As a result, holders of outstanding options received dividend equivalents of approximately $30.3 million in the aggregate. In
addition, to the extent unvested options outstanding on the dividend declaration date vest, such options will be entitled to receive a dividend equivalent payment in the amount of $7.65 per share at the time of vesting.

LEASES

TransDigm leases
certain manufacturing facilities with annual rental payments required through December 2015. One of the facility leases is with a company in which one of our employees is an owner. The term of the lease is through December 2014, although it may be
terminated early under certain circumstances. The base rental for the property is $0.6 million per year. TransDigm also leases office space for its corporate headquarters. The office space leases require annual rental payments of approximately $0.1
million per year through fiscal 2011.

TransDigm also has commitments under operating leases for vehicles and equipment.
Rental expense during the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $3.3 million, $3.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments at September 30, 2009 under operating leases having initial or
remaining non-cancelable lease terms exceeding one year are $3.7 million in fiscal 2010, $3.3 million in fiscal 2011, $2.9 million in fiscal 2012, $2.0 million in fiscal 2013, $1.7 million in fiscal 2014, and $0.5 million thereafter.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The following tables present our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the
inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
liability. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments as of September 30 (in thousands):

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates in the normal course of business. The Company’s risk management program is designed to manage the exposure and
volatility arising from these risks, and utilizes derivative financial instruments to offset a portion of these risks. The Company uses derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to hedge identified business risks, and does not
enter into such transactions for trading purposes. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security with counterparties to these financial instruments and is therefore subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance;
however, the Company monitors credit risk and currently does not anticipate nonperformance by other parties.

Interest rate
swap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floating-rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $780 million. The interest rate swap agreements utilized by the Company effectively modify the Company’s
exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of the Company’s floating-rate debt to a fixed rate basis through the expiration dates of the agreements, thereby reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.
These agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts. These derivative instruments qualify as effective
cash flow hedges under GAAP. For these hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instrument is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and
subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line as the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.

At September 30, 2009, one agreement was in place to swap variable interest rates on the Senior Secured Credit Facility for fixed interest rates for the notional amount of $300 million through
March 23, 2011. This interest rate swap agreement effectively converts the variable rate interest on the notional amount of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 3.04% plus the 2% margin percentage, over the term of the
agreement.

An additional interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of $150 million expired on June 23, 2009.
This interest rate swap agreement effectively converted the variable rate interest on the notional amount of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 5.63% plus the 2% margin percentage, over the term of the agreement.

The net after-tax derivative loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is expected to be reclassified into interest
expense in conjunction with the recognition of interest payments on the notional amounts of the swap contract, with a net $3.6 million of after-tax net loss expected to be recognized in interest expense within the next year.
