PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

The Company

TransDigm
Inc. was formed in July 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses from IMO Industries Inc. TransDigm Group Incorporated (“TD Group”) was formed in July 2003 at the direction of Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII, L.P.
(“Warburg Pincus”) to facilitate the acquisition of TransDigm, Inc. In March 2006 and May 2007, certain stockholders of TD Group and certain members of our management sold shares of TD Group common stock in underwritten public offerings.
TD Group did not offer any shares of common stock for sale in the offerings and TD Group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. As a result of the initial public offering in 2006, TD Group’s
common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “TDG.” As a result of the follow on offering in 2007, TD Group was no longer a “controlled company” for the purposes of the NYSE listing
requirements.

We believe we are a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for
use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers. We estimate that over 95% of our net sales for fiscal year 2010 were generated by
proprietary products. In addition, for fiscal year 2010, we estimate that we generated approximately 80% of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider.

Most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue. Once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft, we generate
net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft, which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years. We estimate that approximately 60% of our net sales in fiscal year 2010 were generated from aftermarket sales, the vast
majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets. These aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs.



On September 25,
2010, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with McKechnie Holdings LLC to purchase all of the outstanding stock of McKechnie Aerospace Holdings, Inc. (“McKechnie”), a privately owned supplier of
innovative aerospace products controlled by JLL Partners Inc., for a total purchase price on a cash-free, debt-free basis of approximately $1,265 million in cash. The Purchase Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and conditions
that we believe are customary for a transaction of this size and type, as well as indemnification provisions subject to specified limitations. The closing of the McKechnie acquisition is subject to several conditions, including receipt of required
regulatory approvals, and there can be no assurance that the McKechnie acquisition will be consummated as contemplated, or at all. We intend to finance the McKechnie acquisition and concurrently refinance a portion of our existing indebtedness
through a combination of senior subordinated notes and borrowings under a new senior secured credit facility.

Products

We primarily design, produce and supply highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components (and certain systems/subsystems) with
significant aftermarket content. We seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers. We attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering, service and manufacturing capabilities. We
typically choose not to compete for non-proprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products. We believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a
reputation for high quality, reliability and customer support.

Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of
products that we offer to our customers. Some of our more significant product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls,
ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, aircraft audio systems, specialized cockpit displays, engineered latching and locking devices,
specialized lavatory components, engineered connectors and elastomers, rods and locking devices, NiCad batteries/chargers, and lighting and control technology.

Sales and Marketing

Consistent with our overall strategy, our sales and
marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs. In particular, we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to high-margin, repeatable sales in the aftermarket.

We have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings, assigning a product manager to certain products. Each product
manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings, sales, new business and profitability for such products. The product managers are
assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major OEM and aftermarket accounts. Account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel, organization and needs of specific customers,
to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and, together with the product managers, to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations. Most of our sales personnel are compensated, in part, on their
bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities.

Though typically performed by employees, the
account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer, product and geographic location. We also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with
certain smaller accounts. Our major distributors are Aviall, Inc. (a subsidiary of The Boeing Company) and Satair A/S (a Danish public company on whose Board of Directors Mr. Howley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, serves).



Manufacturing and Engineering

We maintain eighteen principal manufacturing facilities. Each manufacturing facility comprises manufacturing, distribution
and engineering as well as administrative functions, including management, sales and finance. We continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs, including rationalization of operations, developing improved control systems that allow for
accurate product profit and loss accounting, investing in equipment, tooling, information systems and implementing broad-based employee training programs. Management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to
compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers.

We attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely
delivery. Our engineering costs are recorded in Cost of Sales and in Selling and Administrative captions in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Total engineering expense represents approximately 9% of our operating units’ aggregate costs, or
approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales. Our proprietary products, and particularly our new product initiatives, are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry. These proprietary designs
must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements.

We use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements, specifications and Federal Aviation Administration
(the “FAA”) and OEM requirements. We perform a variety of testing procedures, including testing under different temperature, humidity and altitude levels, shock and vibration testing and X-ray fluorescent measurement. These procedures,
together with other customer approved techniques for document, process and quality control, are used throughout our manufacturing facilities.

Customers

Our customers
include: (1) distributors of aerospace components; (2) worldwide commercial airlines, including national and regional airlines; (3) large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft OEMs; (4) various armed forces of
the United States and friendly foreign governments; (5) defense OEMs; (6) system suppliers; and (7) various other industrial customers. For the year ended September 30, 2010, Boeing (which includes Aviall, Inc., a distributor of
commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world) accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales. Our top ten customers for fiscal year 2010 accounted for approximately 48% of our net sales. Products supplied to many of our customers
are used on multiple platforms.

Active commercial production programs include the Boeing 737, 747, 767 and 777, the Airbus
A319/20/21, A330/A340 and A380, the Bombardier CRJ’s and Challenger, the Embraer RJ’s, the Cessna Citation family, the Raytheon Premier and Hawker and most Gulfstream airframes. Military platforms include aircraft such as the Boeing C-17,
F-15 and F-18, the Lockheed Martin C-130J and F-16, the Northrop Grumman E2C (Hawkeye), the Joint Strikefighter and the Blackhawk, Chinook and Apache helicopters. TransDigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered
products for production on the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350XWB and A400M programs.

We believe that we have strong customer
relationships with almost all large commercial transport, regional, general aviation and military OEMs. The demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on, among other things, the breadth of our installed OEM base, revenue passenger miles
(“RPMs”), the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and, to a lesser extent, airline profitability. We believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on U.S. designed military aircraft, including components that are
used on a variety of fighter aircraft, military freighters and military helicopters.

Competition

The niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the
products and services we provide. Due to the global nature of the commercial



aircraft industry, competition in these categories comes from both U.S. and foreign companies. Competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations that
have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do, to small privately-held entities, with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios.

We compete on the basis of engineering, manufacturing and marketing high quality products, which we believe meet or exceed the
performance and maintenance requirements of our customers, consistent and timely delivery, and superior customer service and support. The industry’s stringent regulatory, certification and technical requirements, and the investments necessary
in the development and certification of products, create barriers to entry for potential new competitors. As long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards, we believe that they will have a reduced
incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process. In addition, we believe that concerns about safety and flight delays if products are unavailable or undependable are
reasons for our customers to continue long-term supplier relationships.

Government Contracts

Companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to business risks specific
to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: (1) suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations; (2) terminate
existing contracts; (3) reduce the value of existing contracts; (4) audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and (5) control and potentially prohibit the export of our products.

Governmental Regulation

The commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the FAA in the United States and by the Joint Aviation Authorities
in Europe and other agencies throughout the world, while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or
agencies, and, in many cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models.

We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs and airlines that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the
government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our
repair and overhaul services. We also maintain several FAA approved repair stations.

In addition, sales of many of our
products that will be used on aircraft owned by non-U.S. entities are subject to compliance with U.S. export control laws.

Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. The Occupational Safety and Health Act
(“OSHA”), mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances.

Raw Materials

We
require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes. We also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers. At times, we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier
relationships. Raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices.



Intellectual Property

We have various trade secrets, proprietary information, trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights and other
intellectual property rights, which we believe, in the aggregate but not individually, are important to our business.

Backlog

As of September 30, 2010, the Company estimated its sales order backlog at $467 million compared to an estimated
sales order backlog of $402 million as of September 30, 2009. The increase in backlog is due to the acquisitions of Dukes Aerospace and Semco, discussed below, totaling approximately $35 million and an increase in orders across existing product
lines in both OEM and aftermarket channels, reflecting the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic. The majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of September 30, 2010 are scheduled for delivery within the next
twelve months. Purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment. The level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the Company’s
receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, the Company’s backlog as of September 30, 2010 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.

Foreign Operations

Although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the United States, we manufacture some products in Malaysia through our wholly-owned Malaysian subsidiary and some products in Mexico through a
maquiladora relationship with a third party. We sell our products in the United States, as well as in foreign countries. Substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in U.S. dollars and, therefore, we have no material exposure to
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar as a result of foreign sales. In addition, the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers, including our
Malaysian manufacturing subsidiary, are not material, with substantially all such transactions being made in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the
U.S. dollar arising from these transactions.

Our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $170.6 million, $150.4
million, and $144.3 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in
business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the Company within such
governments’ countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy.

Environmental Matters

Our operations and facilities are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other
matters, the emission, discharge, generation, management, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, wastes and pollutants, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites, the health and safety of our employees, and permits
required in connection with our operations. Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws, or the
regulations or requirements thereunder, or in the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future. Further, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines
and sanctions, and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law, or the environmental permits required for our operations. Changes in environmental,
health and safety laws or regulations or other or new regulations could increase our cost of doing business or impact the demand for our products.



Under some
environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of,
or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous materials also may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or
treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them. Because we own and/or operate a number of facilities that have a history of industrial or commercial use and because we arrange for the disposal of hazardous
materials at many disposal sites, we may and do incur costs for investigation, removal and remediation. Contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites, principally in connection with historical operations, and investigations
and/or clean-ups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites. We receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time. Although we have not incurred any material
investigation or cleanup costs to date and investigation and cleanup costs are not expected to be material in the future for existing operations of TD Group, the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup
obligations at these or other sites, the failure of any other potentially liable party to meet its obligations, or the initiation of suits for personal injury or damages to property or natural resources could result in significant liability for us.

Employees

As of September 30, 2010, we had approximately 2,400 employees. Approximately 3% of our employees were represented by the United
Steelworkers Union, approximately 2% were represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and approximately 3% were represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Collective
bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in April 2011, November 2012 and May 2013, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory.

Legal Proceedings

We
are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Based upon information currently known to us, we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition or results of operations.

Available Information

TD Group’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, including any amendments, will
be made available free of charge on the Company’s website, www.transdigm.com, as soon as reasonably practicable, following the filing of the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
forward-looking statements contained in this report.

Our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’
planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability. These items are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions.

Our business is directly affected by, among other factors, changes in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), the size and age of the worldwide
aircraft fleet and, to a lesser extent, changes in the profitability of the commercial



airline industry. RPMs and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment, although national and international events also play a key role. For
example, in recent years, the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy, higher fuel prices, the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of September 11, 2001, the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, epidemic and the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition, recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with continued turbulence in the U.S. and international
markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending. As a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events, the airline industry incurred, and some in the industry continue to incur,
large losses and financial difficulties. Some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights. During periods of reduced airline profitability, some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts,
preferring instead to deplete existing inventories. If demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases, there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products.

Future terrorist attacks may have a material adverse impact on our business.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, passenger traffic on commercial flights was significantly lower than prior to the attacks and many commercial airlines reduced their operating
schedules. Overall, the terrorist attacks resulted in billions of dollars in losses to the airline industry. Any future acts of terrorism and any military response to such acts could result in further acts of terrorism and additional hostilities,
including possible retaliatory attacks on sovereign nations, as well as financial, economic and political instability. While the precise effects of any such terrorist attack, military response or instability on our industry and our business is
difficult to determine, it could result in further reductions in the use of commercial aircraft. If demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases, demand for certain of our products would also decrease.

Our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical, and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us.

Our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft, such as The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S, and related OEM suppliers, as well as
manufacturers of business jets, which accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal year 2010, have historically experienced periodic downturns. In the past, these sales have been affected by airline profitability, which is impacted by,
among other things, fuel and labor costs, price competition, downturns in the global economy and national and international events, such as the events of September 11, 2001. In addition, sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets
are impacted by, among other things, downturns in the global economy. Prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales, gross margin and net income.

We rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales.

Our largest
customer for fiscal year 2010 was The Boeing Company (which includes Aviall, Inc., a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world). Boeing accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal year 2010. Our top
ten customers for fiscal year 2010 accounted for approximately 48% of our net sales. A reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason, such as economic downturn, decreased production or strike, could have a material adverse
effect on our net sales, gross margin and net income.

We generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products. Further, when we
enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, we take the risk for cost overruns.

As is customary in our
business, we do not generally have long-term contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and, therefore, do not have guaranteed future sales. Although we have long-term contracts with many of our OEM customers, many of those customers may
terminate the contracts on short notice and, in most cases,



our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing
patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements, and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize.

We also have entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of our customers, pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize all the benefit or
detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products. Sometimes we accept a fixed-price contract for a product that we have not yet produced, and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the
completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices, taxes or labor costs.

U.S. military spending is dependent upon the U.S. defense budget.

The
military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends, particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (the “DOD”) budget. In addition to normal business risks, our supply of products to the United States
Government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. Future DOD budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration, the
U.S. Government’s budget deficits, spending priorities, the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and possible political pressure to reduce U.S. Government military spending, each of which could cause the DOD
budget to remain unchanged or to decline. A significant decline in U.S. military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government.

We intend to pursue future acquisitions. Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory
terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations.

A significant portion of our growth has occurred
through acquisitions. Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. We intend to pursue
acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on
economically acceptable terms. In addition, we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that
business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect.

We regularly
engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. Future acquisitions could likely (and, if the McKechnie
acquisition is consummated, would) result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as
significant charges relating to integration costs.

In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we
acquire (including, potentially, the McKechnie business) into our existing business. The successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. The successful integration of future
acquisitions may (and if the McKechnie acquisition is consummated, will) also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to service, attract
customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities. Furthermore, if the McKechnie acquisition is consummated, the integration of McKechnie into our operations will require significant one-time costs. In
addition, because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities



simultaneously, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight. Assuming
consummation of the McKechnie acquisition, if we have difficulties in integrating the acquisition or if the benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition do not materialize, our substantial indebtedness incurred to fund the acquisition and/or
the substantial attention required from our management could result in our having to forego other opportunities.

We are subject to certain
unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the U.S. Government.

Companies engaged in
supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:

•

suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;

•

terminate existing contracts;

•

reduce the value of existing contracts; and

•

audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.

Most of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government for its convenience. Termination for convenience
provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination.

On contracts where the price is based on cost, the U.S. Government may review our costs and performance, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the
U.S. Government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets,
portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement.

In addition,
even where the price is not based on cost, the U.S. Government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable.” Five of our subsidiaries and divisions were subject to such a pricing review for years
2002 through 2004 and it is possible that we will be subject to a similar pricing review in the future. Such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business. As a
result of such a review, we could be subject to providing a refund to the U.S. Government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the DOD could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for
our parts. Any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from, or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with, certain agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government.

Our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted
or if industry oversight is increased.

The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States and in other
countries. In order to sell our components, we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the FAA, the DOD and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers. If new and more stringent government regulations are
adopted or if industry oversight increases, we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight. In addition, if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our business would
be adversely affected.



In addition to the
aviation approvals, we are at times required to obtain approval from U.S. Government agencies to export our products. Additionally, we are not permitted to export some of our products. A determination by the U.S. Government that we failed to receive
required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the United States, and the penalties that could be imposed by the U.S. Government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant.

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business
and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As
of September 30, 2010, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,771.6 million (including discount or premium, net of amortization, in connection with the issuance of the original notes), which was approximately 74.9% of our total
capitalization. If we consummate the McKechnie acquisition, we expect to add approximately $1,300 million of indebtedness. Accordingly, we expect that indebtedness would represent approximately 84% of our total capitalization as of
September 30, 2010 on a pro forma basis.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional
indebtedness in the future. For example, as of September 30, 2010, we had approximately $198.0 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility. If we consummate the McKechnie acquisition, we expect to obtain a new revolving loan
facility with available borrowings of up to $300 million. Although our senior secured credit facility, the indentures (the “Indentures”) governing the


/


% senior subordinated notes issued in June
2006, February 2007 and October 2009 (the “7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes”) contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the
indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability
to borrow additional funds, make investments and incur liens.

In addition, all of our debt under the senior
secured credit facility, which includes a $780 million term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of $200 million, bears interest at floating rates. If we consummate the McKechnie acquisition, we expect that we would have a higher amount of
term loans and a revolving facility of $300 million bearing interest at floating rates. Accordingly, in the event that interest rates increase, our debt service expense will also increase. In order to reduce the floating interest rate risk, as of
September 30, 2010, the Company was party to an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate of interest through March 23, 2011 on $300 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to
pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and, if the McKechnie acquisition is consummated, any new



notes issued and other indebtedness incurred in connection therewith. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be
available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness. If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments,
selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital.

To service our indebtedness, we will require a
significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes (as well as any new notes that will be
issued and other indebtedness incurred if the McKechnie acquisition is consummated) and amounts borrowed under the credit facilities, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent,
is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at
all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and
the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes (as well as any
new notes that will be issued and other indebtedness incurred if the McKechnie acquisition is consummated), or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital
investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to
restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants,
which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, the Indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make
payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise
adversely affect the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated
Notes (as well as any new notes that will be issued if the McKechnie acquisition is consummated).

The terms of the senior
secured credit facility, Indentures and other debt instruments may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.

Our existing senior secured credit facility and the Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) and may limit their ability to engage
in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The senior secured credit facility and Indentures include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured
credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) to:

•

incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

•

pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;

•

make investments;

•

sell assets;



•

enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;

•

incur or allow to exist liens;

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;

•

engage in transactions with affiliates;

•

create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

•

engage in certain business activities.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the Indentures. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility
and the holders of the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated
Notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these
circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the
collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes. If the debt under the senior secured
credit facility or the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated
Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.

We expect that any new credit facility or new senior subordinated notes entered into or issued in connection with the financing of the McKechnie acquisition would also contain restrictive covenants and
significant operating and financial restrictions on TD Group.

We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities
under environmental laws and regulations.

Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local
and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and
the health and safety of our employees. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and/or third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental
laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws or regulations or other new regulations could increase our costs of doing business or adversely impact the demand
for our products.

Pursuant to certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may
be held liable for the entire cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials. Persons who arrange
for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be held liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by
them. Contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites, principally in connection with historical operations, and investigations and/or clean-ups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites. We also receive
inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time. Although we are not aware of any sites for which material obligations exist, the discovery of additional contaminants, the imposition of
additional clean-up obligations at these or other sites, the failure of any other potentially liable party to meet its obligations or the initiation of suits for personal injury or damages to property or natural resources could result in significant
liability.

McKechnie is a party to a number of legal proceedings and is responsible, in whole or in part, for remediation at
a number of owned or third-party sites, for which McKechnie has reserves on its balance sheet.



Assuming the McKechnie acquisition is consummated, if the amount of any reserves we establish in connection with those remediations and related legal liabilities is significantly less than the
actual costs incurred to satisfy those liabilities, our operating results could be materially impacted.

We are dependent on our highly
trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business.

Because our products are complicated and highly engineered, we depend on an educated and trained workforce. There is substantial
competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry, and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees. We may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain
qualified personnel.

As of September 30, 2010, we had approximately 2,400 employees. Approximately 3% of our employees
were represented by the United Steelworkers Union, approximately 2% were represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and approximately 3% were represented by the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in April 2011, November 2012 and May 2013, respectively. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot assure
you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable. Because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods, any work stoppage could
materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers.

Our business is dependent on the availability of certain
components and raw materials from suppliers.

Our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials
and component parts that we use to manufacture our components. Our business, therefore, could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers (such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure, a
work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality), or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases
to our customers. Because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we
require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive FAA and OEM certification processes associated with aerospace
products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.

We have recorded a significant amount of
intangible assets, which may never generate the returns we expect.

Mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant
increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets, which primarily include trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, license agreements and technology, were approximately $400.4 million at September 30,
2010, representing approximately 15% of our total assets. Goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately $1,571.7 million at September 30, 2010, representing approximately 59% of our total assets. We may
never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards, we
would be required to write-off the amount of any impairment.

We face significant competition.

We operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies, including divisions of larger companies,
some of which have significantly greater resources than we do, and therefore may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote



greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. Competitors in our product lines are both U.S. and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public
corporations to small privately held entities. We believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance, consistent high quality, short lead-time and timely delivery, competitive pricing, superior customer service and support and
continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.

We could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash.

Our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced. While we maintain
liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims, in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate. We also may not be able to maintain insurance
coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us.

In addition, a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products. We believe our customers consider
safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components. If a crash were to be caused by one of our components, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to
retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.

Our stock prices may be volatile, and your investment in our common
stock could suffer a decline in value.

There has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of
equity securities, which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. You may not be able to sell your shares at or
above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such
as fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering, which could cause short-term swings in profit margins, or unrelated to our operating performance, including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies
more specifically.

Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price.

We may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the
future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales
may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate.

Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger
or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 149,600,000 shares of “blank check” preferred
stock. Without stockholder approval, the Board of Directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire us. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board of Directors, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with approximately one-third of the directors coming up for
re-election each year. Having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our Board of Directors through a proxy



contest, which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our Board of Directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock, voting together as a single class, is required for the alteration, amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, including the provisions authorizing a staggered board, and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings, notice
provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting, requests for stockholder lists and corporate records, nomination and removal of directors, and filling of vacancies on our Board of Directors.

We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions,
if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder,” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could
delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, “interested stockholder” means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding
voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203.

We do not intend to pay regular
cash dividends on our stock.

Notwithstanding the special cash dividend paid in October 2009, we do not anticipate
declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future. The amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements. Any payment of
cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and
other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol “TDG.” The following chart sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of the
common stock on the NYSE.

Holders

We estimate that there were approximately 3,400 beneficial holders of our common stock as of November 8, 2010.

Dividends

In October
2009 TD Group’s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $7.65 on each outstanding share of common stock.

We do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Any payment of cash dividends on
our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors
deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. TD Group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries. Unless TD Group receives dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments
from our subsidiaries, TD Group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future. The ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our debt documents and may be limited by future
debt or other agreements that we may enter into.

Non-GAAP Financial
Measures

We present below certain financial information based on our EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined. References to
“EBITDA” mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to “EBITDA As Defined” mean EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations
of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined presented below.



Neither EBITDA nor
EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We present EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined because we believe they are useful indicators for
evaluating operating performance and liquidity.

Our management believes that EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined
are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities analysts, investors, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company’s ability to incur and service debt. In addition, EBITDA As Defined is useful to investors because the
revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility requires compliance, on a pro forma basis, with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our Consolidated EBITDA
defined in the same manner as we define EBITDA As Defined herein. This financial covenant is a material term of our senior secured credit facility as the failure to comply with such financial covenant could result in an event of default in respect
of the revolving credit facility (and such an event of default could, in turn, result in an event of default under the indenture governing our 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes).

In addition to the above, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection
with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections. Moreover, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions.

Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical
tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our
indebtedness;

•

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future,
and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;

•

the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As
Defined;

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and

•

EBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of
certain of our acquisitions.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined should not be
considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA or EBITDA As Defined in isolation and specifically by using other GAAP measures,
such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or
cash flow from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.



The information
presented below should be read together with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere herein.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “Selected Financial
Data” and TD Group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks
and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.

Overview

We believe we are a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all
commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers. Some of our more significant product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to
end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators,
aircraft audio systems, specialized cockpit displays, engineered latching and locking devices, specialized lavatory components, engineered connectors and elastomers, rods and locking devices, NiCad batteries/chargers, and lighting and control
technology. Each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer.

Long-term Sustainable Growth

For fiscal year 2010, we generated net
sales of $827.7 million, gross profit of $473.1 million or 57.2% of sales, and net income of $163.4 million. We believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to
our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure
and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term.

Our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business. The integration of certain acquisitions into our
existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business.

Our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below.



We believe our key
competitive strengths include:

Large and Growing Installed Product Base with Aftermarket Revenue Stream.

We
provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. We estimate that our products are installed on more than 63,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation
fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.

Diversified Revenue Base.

We believe that our diversified
revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. Our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms
now in production.

Significant Barriers to Entry.

We believe that the niche nature of our markets, the
industry’s stringent regulatory and customer certification requirements, the relatively low unit cost as compared to many other highly engineered aerospace products and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create
significant practical barriers to entry for potential competitors.

Our business strategy is made up of two key elements:
(1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.

Value-Driven Operating Strategy.

Our three core value drivers are:

•

Obtaining Profitable New Business.

We attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise, application skill and our
detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. We have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and OEM products to drive our growth.

•

Improving Our Cost Structure.

We are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to
the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.

•

Providing Highly Engineered Value-Added Products to Customers.

We focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of
highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. We believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. This has generally enabled us to price our products to
fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so.

Selective Acquisition
Strategy.

We selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. The aerospace industry, in
particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. We have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions
and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. As of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired and integrated 28 businesses and/or product lines since our formation in 1993. Many of these acquisitions have been
integrated into an existing TransDigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production
volume.

Public Offerings

On March 20, 2006 and May 25, 2007, certain stockholders of TD Group (including certain members of our management) sold an aggregate of 11.5 million and 12.6 million shares of TD
Group’s common stock, respectively, in public offerings at prices of $21.00 and $35.25 per share. TD Group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale in the public offerings and TD Group did not receive any of the proceeds from the
sale of such shares by the selling stockholders. As a result of the initial public offering, TD Group’s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “TDG.”



Certain Acquisitions

Semco Instruments Acquisition

On September 3, 2010, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Semco Instruments, Inc. (“Semco”) for approximately $71 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on
the level of working capital as of the closing date of the acquisition. Semco is a designer and manufacturer of proprietary, highly engineered components for all major turbo-prop, turbo-fan, and turbo-shaft engines, which are primarily used on
helicopters, business jets and selected regional airplanes. These products fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company is in the process of obtaining information to value certain tangible and intangible assets of Semco,
and therefore the consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2010 reflect a preliminary purchase price allocation for the business.

Dukes Aerospace Acquisition

On December 2, 2009, TransDigm
(through Dukes Aerospace, Inc., a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc.) acquired substantially all of the aerospace-related assets of Dukes, Inc. and GST Industries, Inc. (collectively “Dukes Aerospace”) for
approximately $96 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the level of working capital as of the closing date of the acquisition. In addition, the agreement provides for potential earn-out payments up to a total of $60 million over four
years based on the achievement of certain growth targets. Dukes Aerospace is a supplier of proprietary, highly engineered components primarily to the business jet, regional jet, and military aerospace markets, along with commercial and military
helicopter markets. The products are comprised primarily of highly engineered valves and certain pumps, solenoids and related components. These products fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The preliminary purchase price
allocation includes a fair value liability of $8 million recorded for the potential earn-out payments.

Woodward HRT Product Line
Acquisition

On August 10, 2009, TransDigm Inc., through its AeroControlex Group Inc. subsidiary, acquired certain
product line assets of Woodward HRT, Inc., a subsidiary of Woodward Governor Company (“Woodward HRT product line”) for approximately $48.7 million in cash, which includes a purchase price adjustment of $0.7 million paid in February 2010.
The product line comprises a range of highly engineered fuel and pneumatic valves and surge suppressors, the majority of which are used on military rotary and fixed wing aircraft, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business
direction. Woodward Governor had recently acquired this business as part of its acquisition of HR Textron, Inc.

Acme Aerospace
Acquisition

On July 24, 2009, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Acme Aerospace,
Inc. (“Acme”) for approximately $40.9 million in cash, which includes a purchase price adjustment of $0.2 million paid in October 2009. Acme is a designer and manufacturer of proprietary, highly engineered components to the commercial
aerospace industry, comprising primarily fibrous nickel cadmium main ship batteries, battery chargers, battery back-up systems and power conversion equipment. These products fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction.

Aircraft Parts Corporation Acquisition

On December 16, 2008, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Aircraft Parts Corporation (“APC”) for approximately $66.9 million in cash, net of a purchase price
adjustment of $0.7 million received in November 2009. APC is a designer and manufacturer of starter generators, generator control units and related components for turbine engines, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business
direction.

Unison Product Line Acquisition

On September 26, 2008, TransDigm Inc., through its wholly-owned Champion Aerospace, LLC subsidiary, acquired certain assets related to the magneto and harness product line business of Unison
Industries, LLC



(“Unison”) for approximately $68.3 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $1.1 million received in November 2008. The acquired product line includes the highly
engineered SLICK

TM

magnetos, harnesses and components,
which are used on substantially all of the world’s general aviation piston aircraft. These products fit well with Champion’s existing product offerings and TransDigm’s overall business direction.

CEF Acquisition

On May 7, 2008, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of CEF Industries, Inc. (“CEF”) for
approximately $84.5 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $0.5 million received in January 2009. CEF is a designer and manufacturer of specialized and highly engineered actuators, pumps and related components primarily for the
military aerospace market, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction.

Trend Information

We
predominantly serve customers in the commercial, regional, business jet and general aviation aftermarket, which accounts for approximately 40% of total sales; the commercial aerospace OEM market, comprising large commercial transport manufacturers
and regional and business jet manufacturers, which accounts for approximately 23% of total sales; and the defense market, which accounts for approximately 34% of total sales. Non-aerospace sales comprise approximately 3% of our total sales.

The commercial aerospace industry, including the aftermarket and OEM market, is impacted by the health of the global economy
and geo-political events around the world. The commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles, or RPMs, between 2003 and 2008, as well as increases in OEM production and backlog, however, the recent global
economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing RPMs to decline slightly in 2009. In 2010, the commercial aerospace industry has slightly rebounded with increases in RPMs, as well the large commercial OEM sector
(aircraft with 100 or more seats) with order announcements by The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S. leading to planned



increases in production. The 2011 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest that conditions in the commercial transport market sector are likely to improve, including a return to RPM
growth and a modest acceleration of capacity growth.

The defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget
constraints, the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts. It is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry.

Our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of
any specific industry risk. We service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry, and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft, which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe
platform. At times, declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another. However, due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to OEM and aftermarket customers, variation in product mix can cause
variation in gross margin.

There are many short-term factors (including inventory corrections, unannounced changes in order
patterns, strikes and mergers and acquisitions) that can cause short-term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years. To normalize for short-term fluctuations, we tend to look
at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete short-term periods. As such, it can be difficult to determine longer-term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons.

There are also fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter-to-quarter, as well as variations in
product mix from quarter-to-quarter, that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial OEMs. Again, in many instances
these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators.

Commercial Aftermarket

The key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide RPMs and the size and activity level of the
worldwide fleet of aircraft. Although RPMs increased annually between 2003 and 2008, 2009 had negative growth as a result of the expected reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy. Current industry consensus
indicates that RPMs is stabilizing and will return to positive growth thereafter.

Commercial OEM Market

There is industry consensus that conditions in the commercial transport market sector have improved recently. We are expecting increased
activity in the large commercial OEM sector (aircraft with 100 or more seats) driven by order announcements by The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S. Furthermore, the business jet OEM market significantly declined in 2009 and 2010 and is expected to
bottom out in the near future. This market has also been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth, corporate profits, commodity prices and stock market returns across the world.

Defense

In recent years, defense spending has reached historic
highs, due in part to the military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on terrorism. Our military business fluctuates from year to year, and is dependent, to a degree, on government budget constraints, the timing of orders and the extent
of global conflicts. We anticipate that military related sales of our types of products could be flat to modestly down in future years over the current high levels.



Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which often requires the judgment of
management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of
operations. However, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.

We have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends. These critical
policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. Our most critical accounting policies are as follows:

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances:

Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to
the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. Provisions for returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract
warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. We have a history of making reasonably
dependable estimates of such allowances; however, due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material.

Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness. The
allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. Management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for
estimated losses based on historical information. The determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. If circumstances change or economic conditions
deteriorate, management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts.

The Company provides limited warranties in
connection with the sale of its products. The warranty period for products sold varies throughout the Company’s operations, generally ranging from 90 days to six years. In addition, certain contracts with distributors contain right of return
provisions. The Company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources. The Company also provides a general amount based on
historical results. Historically, actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods for all locations except CEF,
which determines the cost of inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Because the Company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 30 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while
the airframes are in use. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels, past usage and future sales forecasts. Although management believes that the Company’s estimates of
obsolete and slow-moving inventory are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. In addition, in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as
current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year.

Intangible Assets:

Mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Fair value
adjustments to the



Company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the
merger or acquisition. We generally use third-party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments.

Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other
legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Company’s intent to do so. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are
reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates. The determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the Company’s strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. The revenue growth
rates included in the plans are based on industry and Company specific data. The profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes. If different assumptions were used in
these plans, the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required. Intangible assets, such as goodwill, trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite
useful life are not amortized. All other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

GAAP requires
that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the Company. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating
subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction, and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment. With respect to
acquisitions integrated into an existing operating subsidiary, any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary.

Stock Options:

The Company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with GAAP

,

which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based
on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options’ vesting periods. Compensation expense is recorded over the service period using the straight-line method for service-based awards and
in the service period corresponding to the performance target for performance-based awards.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data of the Company, including presentation of the amounts as
a percentage of net sales (amounts in thousands):

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009

Net Sales.

Net sales increased by $66.1 million, or 8.7%, to $827.7 million for fiscal 2010 from $761.5 million for fiscal 2009.
Sales of $73.8 million resulted from the acquisitions of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme



and the Woodward HRT product line in fiscal 2009 as well as the recent acquisitions of Dukes Aerospace and Semco in fiscal 2010.

Sales excluding acquisitions declined by $7.6 million, or 1.0%, from the prior year. The decline in organic sales was primarily due to a
decrease of $18.7 million of commercial OEM sales resulting primarily from the business jet OEM’s significant production rate reductions and related inventory reductions resulting from the impact of the global economic conditions. Partially
offsetting the decline in organic commercial OEM sales was (i) an increase of $6.2 million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic; and (ii) an increase of $2.7 million
in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for OEM products across most of our product lines.

Cost of Sales and
Gross Profit.

Cost of sales increased by $22.4 million, or 6.7%, to $354.6 million for fiscal 2010 from $332.2 million for fiscal 2009. The increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the
higher net sales discussed above. In addition, the increase was partially attributable to higher costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into TD Group’s operations and purchase accounting adjustments to inventory that were charged to
cost of sales of $3.3 million.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 57.2% for fiscal 2010 from 56.4% for fiscal
2009. The dollar amount of gross profit increased by $43.7 million, or 10.2%, to $473.1 million for fiscal year 2010 from $429.3 million for fiscal 2009. The increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items:

•

Sales of $73.8 million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately $26 million in fiscal 2010, which includes the
acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with those acquisitions. These acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 by approximately 2 percentage points.

•

Favorable product mix, favorable product pricing on our proprietary products and cost reduction efforts partially offset by the negative impact of
fixed overhead costs spread over lower production volume (excluding acquisitions). The net impact of these items resulted in increased gross profit of approximately $18 million in fiscal 2010 despite the decline in organic sales of $7.6 million
discussed above.

Selling and Administrative Expenses.

Selling and administrative expenses increased
by $14.9 million or 18.6%, to $94.9 million, 11.5% of net sales, for fiscal 2010 from $80.0 million, or 10.5% of net sales, for fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent
acquisitions of approximately $6.4 million, transaction-related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Dukes Aerospace and Semco Instruments of approximately $2.7 million, higher research and development expenses primarily relating
to Airbus A350 and A380 platforms more than offsetting declines in expenses on the Boeing 787, new business development expenses and higher professional fees.

Amortization of Intangibles.

Amortization of intangibles increased to $15.1 million for fiscal 2010 from $13.9 million for fiscal 2009. The net increase of $1.2 million was primarily due to
amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months partially offset by the order backlog becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2009 relating to prior
acquisitions.

Income from Operations.

Operating income increased by $27.7 million, or 8.2%, to $363.1 million for
fiscal 2010 from $335.4 million for fiscal 2009, primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above.

Interest Expense-Net

.

Interest expense-net increased $27.8 million, or 33.0%, to $112.2 million for fiscal 2010 from $84.4 million for fiscal 2009, comprising an increase in interest
expense of $26.7 million and a decrease in interest income of $1.1 million. Interest expense increased primarily due to interest expense of approximately $37.3 million attributable to the $425 million of 7


/


% senior subordinated notes due 2014 issued



in October 2009. Partially offsetting the increase was lower interest rates on the Company’s existing floating-rate borrowings under its senior secured credit facility. The Company’s
weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately $1.78 billion for fiscal 2010 and approximately $1.36 billion for fiscal 2009. The average interest rate on total debt was approximately 6.0% for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 (see
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” below). Interest income was lower primarily due to lower interest rates on our invested cash balances.

Income Taxes

.

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 34.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.1% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was primarily due to reductions in estimated state tax obligations and domestic tax credits.

Net Income.

Net
income increased $0.5 million, or 0.3%, to $163.4 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $162.9 million for fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of the factors referred to above.

Earnings per Share.

The basic and diluted earnings per share, calculated under the two-class method, was $2.52 per share for fiscal 2010 and $3.10 per share for fiscal 2009. Due to the special cash
dividend declared and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the net income for fiscal 2010 of $163.4 million was reduced by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of $30.3 million (approximately $0.57 per share) resulting in
a net income applicable to common stockholders of $133.1 million.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
ended September 30, 2008

Net Sales.

Net sales increased by $47.8 million, or 6.7%, to $761.5 million for
fiscal 2009 from $713.7 million for fiscal 2008. Sales of $64.7 million resulted from the acquisitions of CEF and the Unison product line in fiscal 2008 as well as the recent acquisitions of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme and the Woodward HRT
product line.

Sales excluding acquisitions declined by $16.9 million, or 2.4%, from the prior year. The net decline in
organic sales was primarily due to: (i) a decrease of $30.4 million of commercial OEM sales resulting primarily from the impact of the significant decline in production rates in the business jet market resulting from the continued impact of
global economic conditions negatively impacting the business jet market and a reduction in sales to The Boeing Company due to its employee strike; (ii) a decrease of $20.1 million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the impact of the global
economic downturn resulting in a decline in worldwide airline traffic and business jet activity; and (iii) an increase of $37.9 million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for OEM and aftermarket spare parts and repairs across
most of our product lines.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.

Cost of sales increased by $4.4 million, or 1.4%, to $332.2
million for fiscal 2009 from $327.8 million for fiscal 2008. The increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of $47.8 million discussed above and higher
acquisition-related costs of $3.4 million, partially offset by the cost savings from the work force reductions discussed below.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 56.4% for fiscal 2009 from 54.1% for fiscal 2008. The dollar amount of gross profit
increased by $43.4 million, or 11.2%, to $429.3 million for fiscal 2009 from $385.9 million for fiscal 2008. The increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items:

•

Sales of $64.7 million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately $23 million in fiscal 2009, which includes the
acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with those acquisitions. These acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 by approximately 2 percentage points.

•

Reductions in manufacturing workforce of approximately 10% which occurred from mid-calendar year 2008 throughout calendar year 2009. These reductions
in manufacturing workforce were in response to an anticipated drop in overall commercial aerospace market sales. These workforce reductions resulted in cost savings which increased gross profit by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2009.



•

Favorable product mix, meaning that the lower margin OEM product sales dropped more than the higher margin aftermarket product sales, favorable product
pricing on our proprietary products and other cost reduction efforts partially offset by the impact of fixed overhead costs spread over lower production volume (excluding acquisitions). These factors resulted in increased gross profit of
approximately $10 million in fiscal 2009 despite the decrease in organic sales.

Selling and
Administrative Expenses.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by $5.4 million or 7.2%, to $80.0 million for fiscal 2009 from $74.7 million for fiscal 2008. This increase was primarily due to the higher sales discussed above.

Amortization of Intangibles.

Amortization of intangibles increased by $1.9 million to $13.9 million for fiscal 2009 from $12.0
million for fiscal 2008 primarily due to the recent acquisitions discussed above.

Income from Operations.

Operating
income increased by $36.1 million, or 12.1%, to $335.4 million for fiscal 2009 from $299.2 million for fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above.

Interest Expense-Net

.

Interest expense decreased $8.3 million, or 8.9%, to $84.4 million for fiscal 2009 from $92.7
million for fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a reduction in interest income of $4.5 million. The Company’s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately $1.36 billion during both fiscal
2009 and 2008 year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately 6.0% during fiscal 2009 from 6.9% for the comparable period last year.

Income Taxes

.

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 35.1% for fiscal 2009 compared to 35.6% for fiscal 2008. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the research and development tax credit.

Net Income.

Net income increased
$29.8 million, or 22.4% to $162.9 million for fiscal 2009 compared to $133.1 million for fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of the factors referred to above.

Earnings per Share.

The basic and diluted earnings per share, calculated under the two-class method, was $3.10 per share for fiscal 2009 and $2.56 per share for fiscal 2008.

Backlog

As of
September 30, 2010, the Company estimated its sales order backlog at $467 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of $402 million as of September 30, 2009. The increase in backlog is due to the acquisitions of Dukes Aerospace
and Semco, discussed above, totaling approximately $35 million and an increase in orders across existing product lines in both OEM and aftermarket channels, reflecting the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic. The
majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of September 30, 2010 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months. Purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment. The level of unfilled
purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the Company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, the Company’s backlog as of
September 30, 2010 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.

Foreign Operations

Although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the United States, we manufacture some products in Malaysia
through our wholly-owned Malaysian subsidiary and some products in Mexico through a maquiladora relationship with a third party. We sell our products in the United States, as well as in foreign countries. Substantially all of our foreign sales are
transacted in U.S. dollars and, therefore, we have no material



exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar as a result of foreign sales. In addition the amount of components or other raw materials or
supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers, including our Malaysian manufacturing subsidiary, are not material, with substantially all such transactions being made in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we have no material exposure to currency
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar arising from these transactions.

Our
direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $170.6 million, $150.4 million, and $144.3 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of
foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on
the business or market opportunities of the Company within such governments’ countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and
growth strategy.

Inflation

Many of the Company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation, which could result in changing operating costs. The effects of inflation on the Company’s
businesses during the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not significant.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage both to optimize
our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. We expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and/or through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the
maturity dates of our debt.

We continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and
effectively meet the current and future needs of our business. The Company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage, taking into consideration the Company’s debt holders, equity holders, credit ratings,
acquisition opportunities and other factors. The Company’s debt leverage ratio, which is computed as total debt divided by EBITDA As Defined for the applicable twelve-month period, has varied widely during the Company’s history, ranging
from approximately 3.5 to 6.5. Our debt leverage ratio for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 was approximately 4.3.

Notwithstanding the definitive agreement to acquire McKechnie Aerospace Holdings, Inc. described below, the Company has not, at this
time, determined to change the nature of its debt facilities. However, in the future, the Company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other
short-term cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends. Our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.

We note that our senior secured credit facility matures in June 2013 and our 7


/


% Senior Secured Notes under our Indentures mature in July 2014. As
always, we are evaluating our options with respect to the maturity of such indebtedness. Notwithstanding the definitive agreement to acquire McKechnie Aerospace Holdings, Inc. described below, our current plan is to refinance a significant portion
of our long-term debt upon maturity or prior to that time if the conditions of the credit markets become more favorable.

On September 25, 2010, TransDigm entered into a Definitive Agreement with McKechnie Holdings LLC to purchase all of the outstanding
stock of McKechnie, for a total purchase price on a cash-free, debt-free basis of approximately $1,265 million in cash. The Purchase Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and conditions that we believe are customary for a
transaction of this size and type, as well as indemnification provisions subject to specified limitations. The closing of the McKechnie acquisition, which is expected before



the end of the calendar year, is subject to several conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, and there can be no assurance that the McKechnie acquisition will be
consummated as contemplated, or at all. We intend to finance the McKechnie acquisition and concurrently refinance a portion of our existing indebtedness through a combination of senior subordinated notes and borrowings under a new senior secured
credit facility. If we consummate the McKechnie acquisition, we expect to add approximately $1,300 million of indebtedness.

Operating Activities.

The Company generated $197.3 million of cash from operating activities on net income of $163.4 million
during fiscal 2010 compared to $197.1 million of cash from operating activities generated on net income of $162.9 million during fiscal 2009.

The Company generated $197.1 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2009 compared to $189.6 million generated during fiscal 2008. The increase of $7.5 million in fiscal 2009 is primarily
due to an increase in net income of $29.8 million partially offset by the payout of the deferred compensation liability of $6.2 and the change in income taxes receivable (including the impact of the excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options)
of $12.8 million.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $176.6 million during fiscal 2010
consisting primarily of the acquisitions of Dukes Aerospace and Semco for a total of $166.6 million and capital expenditures of $12.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2010 also includes cash proceeds of $2.9 million from the
sale of real estate no longer utilized that was acquired in a previous acquisition.

Cash used in investing activities was
$168.4 million during fiscal 2009 consisting primarily of the acquisitions of the businesses of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme and Woodward HRT product lines for a total of $155.2 million and capital expenditures of $13.2 million.

Cash used in investing activities was $165.0 million during fiscal 2008 consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of CEF and the
Unison product line for a total of $154.1 million and capital expenditures of $10.9 million.

Financing
Activities.

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2010 was $23.2 million, which comprised $404.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes in October 2009, $404.9 million of
dividends and dividend equivalent payments, and $23.8 million of cash for tax benefits related to share-based payment arrangements and from the exercise of stock options.

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 was $2.4 million related to the exercise of stock options of $17.6 million
partially offset by purchases of treasury stock amounting to $15.2 million.

Cash provided by financing activities during
fiscal 2008 of $28.5 million related to the exercise of stock options.

Description of Current Senior Secured Credit Facility and
Indentures

In June 2006 TransDigm refinanced its entire debt structure. In connection with the refinancing, TransDigm Inc.
obtained a new senior secured credit facility. The senior secured credit facility was amended in 2007 in connection with the acquisition of ATI. The senior secured credit facility consists of a $780 million in term loans and a $200 million revolving
loan facility. In addition, under the terms of the senior secured credit facility, TransDigm Inc. has the right to request (but no lender was committed to provide) additional term loans of up to $300 million, subject to the satisfaction of customary
conditions, including pro forma compliance with the financial covenant contained in the senior secured credit facility after giving effect to any such incremental term loan borrowings. At September 30, 2010, $198.0 million of the revolving
credit facility was available.



The term loan facility will mature in June 2013 and is not subject to interim scheduled
amortization, but is subject to certain prepayment requirements. Under the amended terms of the senior secured credit facility, commencing 90 days after the end of fiscal 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, TransDigm Inc. is required to prepay
outstanding term loans in a principal amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the senior secured credit facility); provided that the amount of the prepayment will be reduced to 25% of Excess Cash Flow if the Consolidated Leverage
Ratio at the end of the applicable fiscal year is less than 5.00 to 1.00, but greater than 4.50 to 1.00. TransDigm Inc. will not be required to prepay any of the term loans if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal
year is equal to or less than 4.50 to 1.00 or if the term loans achieve certain minimum credit ratings at the end of such fiscal year. “Excess Cash Flow” is a negotiated definition generally designed to capture the cash that was generated
by our business in excess of cash used in the business. “Consolidated Leverage Ratio” means the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to the aggregate amount of EBITDA As Defined, calculated on a pro forma basis. TransDigm’s
Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 4.2 to 1.00 at September 30, 2010, thus the Company was not obligated to make a prepayment of the term loans based upon the Excess Cash Flow provision.

In addition, subject to exceptions (including reinvestment in productive assets), TransDigm Inc. is required to offer to prepay the term
loans with the net proceeds of certain asset sales. The revolving loan facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in June 2012.

The senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by TD Group and all of TransDigm Inc.’s current domestic restricted subsidiaries, and is secured by a first priority security interest in
substantially all of the existing property and assets of TransDigm Inc. and all of TransDigm Inc.’s existing domestic restricted subsidiaries, and a first priority pledge of the capital stock of TransDigm Inc. and TransDigm Inc.’s domestic
subsidiaries.

The interest rates per annum applicable to loans, other than swingline loans, under the senior secured credit
facility are, at the Company’s option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine or twelve month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm Inc.,
in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. The alternate base rate is the greater of (1) Credit Suisse’s prime rate or (2) 50 basis points over the weighted average rates on overnight Federal funds as published by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. The adjusted LIBO rate is determined by reference to settlement rates established for deposits in dollars in the London interbank market for a period equal to the interest period of the loan as adjusted for the maximum
reserve percentages established by the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve. The applicable margin percentage is a percentage per annum equal to (1) 1.00% for alternate base rate term loans, (2) 2.00% for adjusted LIBO
rate term loans, (3) in the case of alternate base rate revolving loans and adjusted LIBO rate revolving loans, a percentage which varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio of TransDigm Inc. as of the relevant date of determination.

TransDigm Inc. entered into a three year interest rate swap in June 2006 with Credit Suisse for an initial notional amount of
$187 million at a fixed rate of 7.63%. The notional amount decreased to $150 million on September 23, 2008, and the swap agreement expired on June 23, 2009. TransDigm Inc. entered into an additional three year interest rate swap in January
2008 with Credit Suisse for the notional amount of $300 million at a fixed rate of 5.0% through March 2011.

In connection with the refinancing, TransDigm Inc. also issued $275 million aggregate principal amount of 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result of the
acquisition of ATI, TransDigm Inc. issued an additional $300 million aggregate principal amount of


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes under the Indenture
dated as of June 23, 2006.

In October 2009, TransDigm issued an additional $425
million aggregate principal amount of 7


/


% Senior
Subordinated Notes at an issue price of 97.125% of the principal amount thereof. The terms of the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in October 2009 are substantially identical to the terms of the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes that were issued and sold by TransDigm in June 2006 and February 2007.



The proceeds from the issuance of the New 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes, after the original issue discount, were
used to make a cash distribution to TD Group, which paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately $375 million, made dividend equivalent payments to its holders of stock options of approximately $30 million and paid for
transaction-related fees and expenses.

Such notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in July
2014. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally and on an unsecured senior subordinated basis, by TD Group and all of our existing domestic subsidiaries.

Certain Restrictive Covenants in Our Debt Documents

Both the senior secured credit facility and the Indentures contain restrictive covenants that, among other things,
limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of other indebtedness. In addition, the revolving
loan facility under the senior secured credit facility requires TransDigm Inc. to comply with a first lien leverage ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under
the senior secured credit facility or the Indentures. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes may elect to
declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate
any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the
debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes.

If the McKechnie acquisition is consummated, we anticipate that we will incur additional indebtedness, which
will be subject to similar covenants and agreements.

Stock Repurchase Program

In October 2008 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed $50 million in the
aggregate. During 2009, a total of 494,100 shares were repurchased under this program at an aggregate cost of approximately $15.2 million. During 2010, we did not repurchase any shares under the program.

Contractual Obligations

The following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2010 (in millions):

(1)

The senior secured credit facility will mature on June 23, 2013 and will not be subject to interim scheduled amortization.

(2)

Assumes that the variable interest rate on our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility remains constant at 3.6%.



In addition to the
contractual obligations set forth above, the Company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and, from time to time, for facility expansion. Capital expenditures totaled
approximately $12.9 million, $13.2 million, and $10.9 million during fiscal 2010, 2009, and fiscal 2008, respectively. The Company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 to be between $15 million and $20 million and such expenditures are
projected to increase moderately thereafter.

The Company intends to pursue acquisitions that present opportunities consistent
with the Company’s business direction. The Company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect
to any future acquisition. The Company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company incurs
additional debt to finance acquisitions, total interest expense will increase.

If the Company has excess cash, it may
consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend, prepayment of indebtedness, repurchase of stock, or other means. In October 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the
repurchase of up to $50 million, in the aggregate, of the Company’s common stock. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased a total of 494,100 shares at an aggregate cost of $15.2 million. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the
program in 2010. Whether the Company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The
amounts involved may be material. In addition, the Company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so.

The Company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the Company’s indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development
efforts, will depend on the Company’s ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control. Based on its current levels of
operations and absent any disruptive events, management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations, non-acquisition related
capital expenditures, research and development efforts and long-term indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2011. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or
that future borrowings will be available to the Company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs. The Company may need to refinance all or a portion of
its indebtedness on or before maturity. Also, to the extent the Company accelerates its growth plans, consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses, the Company may also need to raise additional capital. In
particular, increased working capital needs occur whenever the Company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable
terms or at all.

If the McKechnie acquisition is consummated, we anticipate that we will incur additional indebtedness to
finance the acquisition and to refinance existing indebtedness.

New Accounting Standards

New Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2010

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, contingent consideration, and certain acquired contingencies to be measured at
their fair values as of the date of acquisition. This guidance also requires that acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business combination. This authoritative guidance was adopted as of October 1,
2009.



In connection with the
acquisition of Dukes Aerospace and Semco, TD Group recorded approximately $2.7 million of acquisition-related costs, which are included in selling and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2010.

Additional Disclosure Required by Indenture

Separate financial statements of TransDigm Inc. are not presented since TD Group has no operations or significant assets separate from its investment in TransDigm Inc. and since the 7

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally
include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At September 30, 2010, we had borrowings under our senior secured credit facility of $780 million that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facility
bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each
case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the Company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. The
effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our senior secured credit facility by approximately $7.8 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at
September 30, 2010. The weighted average interest rate on the $780 million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility on September 30, 2010 was 2.4%.

At September 30, 2010, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our senior secured credit facility for fixed interest rates through March 23, 2011 for the notional amount
of $300 million. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2010, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement
was a liability of $3.9 million.

The fair value of the $780 million aggregate principal amount of
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility is exposed to the market risk of interest rates. The estimated fair value of such term loan approximated $762 million at September 30, 2010 based upon information provided to the Company from
its agent under the credit facility. The fair value of the $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of our


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes is exposed to the
market risk of interest rate changes. The estimated fair value of such notes approximated $1,010 million at September 30, 2010 based upon quoted market rates.

Controls and Procedures

As of September 30, 2010, TD Group carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of TD Group’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of TD Group’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that TD Group’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by TD Group in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to TD Group’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, TD Group’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
management of TD Group is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, TransDigm’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010. Based on our assessment,
management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2010.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have issued an audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of the Company as of September 30,
2010. This report is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in TD Group’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, TD Group’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

TransDigm Group Incorporated

We have audited TransDigm Group Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). TransDigm Group Incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, TransDigm Group Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of September 30, 2010, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of TransDigm Group Incorporated as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2010 and our report dated November 15, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(3)

Options issued outside of the 2003 stock option plan and the 2006 stock incentive plan.

2003 Stock Option Plan

In connection with the acquisition of the Company
by Warburg Pincus in 2003, TD Group adopted a stock option plan for the benefit of our employees. The stock option plan has been amended and restated on several occasions, most recently effective as of July 18, 2008 and we refer to such stock
option plan as it is currently in effect as the 2003 stock option plan.

Upon the closing of the acquisition of the Company by
Warburg Pincus, certain employees rolled over certain then-existing options to purchase shares of common stock of TransDigm Inc.’s former holding company with an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $35.7 million into a combination of
options to purchase shares of common stock of TD Group, or rollover options, and interests in the two deferred compensation plans which have since been terminated. These employees were granted rollover options to purchase an aggregate of 3,870,152
shares of TD Group common stock, which gives effect to the 149.60 for 1.00 stock split that we effected on March 14, 2006 in connection with our initial public offering. All rollover options granted in connection with the closing of the
acquisition were fully vested on the date of grant. As of September 30, 2010,



there were rollover options to purchase 117,436 shares of TD Group common stock issued and outstanding (after giving effect to the stock split).

In addition to the shares of TD Group common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of rollover options, under the terms of the 2003
stock option plan, an aggregate of 5,469,301 shares of TD Group common stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of new management options (after giving effect to the stock split). As of September 30, 2010, there were new management options
to purchase 2,869,757 shares of TD Group common stock outstanding (after giving effect to the stock split). As of September 30, 2010, there were 77,829 shares available for issuance under options not yet granted.

2006 Stock Incentive Plan

Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, TD Group adopted a new stock incentive plan, which was amended on
October 20, 2006 and effective July 29, 2008, designed to assist us in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding key employees, directors or consultants, and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders of TD Group by
closely aligning the interests of these individuals with those of our stockholders. The 2006 stock incentive plan permits TD Group to award our key employees, directors or consultants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives.
The total number of shares of TD Group common stock reserved for issuance or delivery under the 2006 stock incentive plan is 4,119,668, subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger,
share exchange or any other similar corporate transaction or event. As of September 30, 2010, there were 3,892 restricted shares issued and outstanding under the 2006 stock incentive plan. In addition, options to purchase 3,008,385 shares had
been issued thereunder, of which 2,979,825 are outstanding. As of September 30, 2010, there were 1,090,635 shares available for issuance under options not yet granted.

In connection with the acquisition of the Company by Warburg Pincus, the Company issued 132,096 options to Michael Graff, a director of the Company. Because Mr. Graff was not an employee of the
Company and because participation in the 2003 Stock Option Plan was limited to employees, the options were issued outside of the 2003 Stock Option Plan. All of the options awarded to Mr. Graff are vested. As of September 30, 2010, 108,096
options remained outstanding and exercisable.

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

TransDigm Group Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TransDigm Group Incorporated as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2010. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of TransDigm Group Incorporated at September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” the Company adopted a change in the method of accounting in 2010 regarding the date of the Company’s annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of TransDigm Group Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 15, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ACQUISITIONS

Semco
Instruments

—On September 3, 2010, TransDigm Inc. completed the acquisition of Semco Instruments, Inc. (“Semco”) for approximately $71 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the level of working capital as of the
closing date of the acquisition. Semco manufactures proprietary, highly engineered components for major turbo-prop, turbo-fan, and turbo-shaft engines which are primarily used on helicopters, business jets and selected regional airplanes. These
products fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company expects that the approximately $43 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Dukes Aerospace

—On December 2, 2009, TransDigm Inc., through a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm
Inc., Dukes Aerospace Inc., acquired certain assets and liabilities from Dukes, Inc. and GST Industries, Inc. (collectively “Dukes Aerospace”) for approximately $96 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the level of working
capital as of the closing date of the acquisition. In addition, the agreement provides for potential earn-out payments up to a total of $60 million over four years based on the achievement of certain growth targets. Dukes Aerospace is a supplier of
proprietary, highly engineered components primarily to the business jet, regional jet, and military aerospace markets, along with commercial and military helicopter markets. The products are comprised primarily of highly engineered valves and
certain pumps, solenoids and related components. These products fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The preliminary purchase price allocation includes a fair value liability of $8 million recorded for the potential earn-out
payments. The Company expects that the approximately $64 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

F-6


Woodward HRT
Product Line

—On August 10, 2009, TransDigm Inc., through its AeroControlex Group Inc. subsidiary, acquired certain product line assets of Woodward HRT, Inc., a subsidiary of Woodward Governor Company (“Woodward HRT product
line”) for approximately $48.7 million in cash, which includes a purchase price adjustment of $0.7 million paid in February 2010. The product line comprises a range of highly engineered fuel and pneumatic valves and surge suppressors, the
majority of which are used on military rotary and fixed wing aircraft, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. Woodward Governor recently acquired this business as part of its acquisition of HR Textron, Inc. The
Company expects that the $27 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

Acme Aerospace

—On July 24, 2009, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Acme Aerospace,
Inc. (“Acme”) for approximately $40.9 million in cash, which includes a purchase price adjustment of $0.2 million paid in October 2009. Acme is a designer and manufacturer of proprietary, highly engineered components to the commercial
aerospace industry, comprising primarily fibrous nickel cadmium main ship batteries, battery chargers, battery back-up systems and power conversion equipment. These products fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company
expects that the $32 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Aircraft Parts Corporation

—On December 16, 2008, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Aircraft Parts Corporation (“APC”) for approximately $66.9 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of $0.7 million received in November 2009. APC is a designer and manufacturer of starter generators, generator control units and
related components for turbine engines, all of which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company expects that the $50 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Unison Product Line

—On September 26, 2008, TransDigm Inc., through its wholly-owned Champion
Aerospace, LLC subsidiary, acquired certain assets related to the magneto and harness product line business of Unison Industries, LLC (“Unison product line”) for approximately $68.3 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of
$1.1 million received in November 2008. The acquired product line includes the highly engineered SLICK

TM

magnetos, harnesses and components, which are used on substantially all of the world’s general aviation piston aircraft. These products fit well with Champion’s existing product offerings and
TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company expects that the $60 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

CEF

—On May 7, 2008, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of CEF Industries, Inc. (“CEF”) for approximately $84.5 million in cash, net of a
purchase price adjustment of $0.5 million received in January 2009. CEF is a designer and manufacturer of specialized and highly engineered actuators, compressors, pumps and related components primarily for the military aerospace market, all of
which fit well with TransDigm’s overall business direction. The Company expects that the $52 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.

The Company accounted for the acquisitions of the businesses of Semco, Dukes Aerospace, the Woodward HRT product line, Acme, APC, the
Unison product line and CEF (collectively, the “Acquisitions”) using the acquisition method and included the results of operations of the Acquisitions in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of each acquisition.
The Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets of Dukes Aerospace and Semco; thus, the values attributed to acquired assets in the consolidated financial statements are subject to
adjustment. Pro forma net sales and results of operations for the Acquisitions, had the Acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the applicable fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 or 2009, are not significant and, accordingly, are not
provided.

The Acquisitions strengthen and expand the Company’s position to design, produce and supply highly-engineered
proprietary aerospace components in niche markets with significant aftermarket content and provide opportunities to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. The

F-7


purchase price paid for each acquisition reflects the current earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and cash flows, as well as, the future EBITDA and cash flows
expected to be generated by the business, which are driven in most cases by the recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of a particular aircraft, estimated to be approximately 30 years.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

—The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”) and include the accounts of TD Group and subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances

—Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of
shipment. Substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. Provisions for estimated returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in
the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, it is possible that actual
results may vary from the estimates.

Shipping and Handling Costs

—All shipping and handling costs are
included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Research and Development Costs

—The
Company expenses research and development costs as incurred and classifies such amounts in selling and administrative expenses. The expense recognized for research and development costs for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
approximately $13.9 million, $12.6 million, and $13.2 million, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

—The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts

—The Company reserves for amounts determined to be uncollectible based on specific
identification of losses and estimated losses based on historical experience. The allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. The determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is
subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. If circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate or improve, the allowance for doubtful accounts could increase or decrease.

Inventories

—Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories is determined by the average
cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods for all locations except CEF, which determines the cost of inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Approximately 8% of the inventory was valued under the LIFO method at
September 30, 2010. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory is made based on management’s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts. In accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as
current assets even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

—Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements from 10 to 20 years, buildings and improvements from 5 to
30 years, machinery and equipment from 2 to 10 years and furniture and fixtures from 3 to 10 years.

F-8


Property, plant and
equipment is assessed for potential impairment by determining whether the carrying value of the property can be recovered through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations over the property’s remaining estimated useful life. Any
impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Debt Issue Costs,
Premiums and Discounts

—The cost of obtaining financing as well as premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective obligations/securities.

Intangible Assets

—Intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles acquired or recognized in accounting for the
acquisitions (trademarks, trade names, technology, order backlog and a license agreement) and goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment testing. Management determines fair value using
a discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.

A two-step impairment test is used to identify
potential goodwill impairment. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit (as defined) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the
reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired, and the second step of the goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. The second step measures the amount of impairment, if any, by comparing the carrying value of the
goodwill associated with a reporting unit to the implied fair value of the goodwill derived from the estimated overall fair value of the reporting unit and the individual fair values of the other assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.

GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting
unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the Company. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction, and
therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing operating subsidiary, any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the
operating subsidiary.

The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between their fair
values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the sum of any such excesses.

The Company assesses the recoverability of its amortizable intangible assets by determining whether the amortization over their remaining
lives can be recovered through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations. Amortization of amortizable intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: technology from 20 to 22
years, order backlog over one year, and a license agreement over 20 years.

In prior fiscal years, the annual impairment test
of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was performed as of the last day of our fourth quarter. For fiscal 2010, the measurement date was changed to the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter. As a result of our growth and increase in the
number of reporting units, we believe the change in our measurement date is preferable in order to provide additional time to quantify the fair value of our reporting units and to evaluate the results of the impairment testing.

Stock Option Plans

—The Company records stock-based compensation measured using the fair value method of accounting.
Compensation expense is recorded over the service period using the straight-line method for service-based awards and in the service period corresponding to the performance target for performance-based awards. Beginning in fiscal 2009, stock-based
compensation expense was adjusted for projected forfeitures based on historical experience.

Income
Taxes

—The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred taxes are recorded for the difference between the book and tax basis of various assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when
it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

On October 1, 2007, the
Company adopted authoritative guidance establishing the minimum accounting and disclosure requirements of uncertain tax positions. The Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $1.7 million, increasing its liability for unrecognized tax
benefits, interest, and penalties and reducing the October 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

Contingencies

—During the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time threatened with, or may become
a party to, legal actions and other proceedings. While the Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings, it believes the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows. The Company believes that its potential exposure to such legal actions is adequately covered by its aviation product and general liability insurance.

Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Comprehensive Income
(Loss)

—The term “comprehensive income (loss)” represents the change in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events and circumstances resulting from non-stockholder sources. The Company’s accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss, consisting principally of its interest rate swaps, is reported separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, net of taxes of ($0.9) million, $3.4 million, and ($0.1)
million as of September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Reporting

—Management evaluates the Company as one reporting segment in the aerospace industry. The Company is
engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of highly engineered aircraft components used in aerospace and defense applications through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Substantially all of the Company’s operations are located within the United
States.

Earnings per Share

—Earnings per share information is determined using the two-class method, which
includes the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and other securities that participate in dividends (“participating securities”). Our vested stock options are considered “participating
securities” because they include non-forfeitable rights to dividends. In applying the two-class method, earnings are allocated to both common stock shares and participating securities based on their respective weighted-average shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share information may include the additional effect of other securities, if dilutive, in which case the dilutive effect of such securities is calculated using the treasury stock method.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

New Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2010

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, contingent consideration, and certain acquired contingencies to be measured at
their fair values as of the date of acquisition. This guidance also requires that acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business combination. This authoritative guidance was adopted as of October 1,
2009.

In connection with the acquisition of Dukes Aerospace and Semco, TD Group recorded approximately $2.7 million of
acquisition-related costs, which are included in selling and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2010.

DEBT

The Company’s
long-term debt consists of the following at September 30 (in thousands):

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans

—TransDigm Inc.’s Senior Secured Credit
Facility totals $980 million, which consists of (1) a $200 million revolving credit line maturing in June 2012 and (2) a $780 million term loan facility maturing in June 2013. The interest rate on the term loans at September 30, 2010
was 2.3%. At September 30, 2010, the Company had $2.0 million letters of credit outstanding and $198.0 million of borrowings available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $300 million which effectively converts the variable rate
interest on the notional amount of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 3.04% plus the 2% margin percentage, over the term of the agreement.

The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, or six-month (or to
the extent available to each lender, nine or twelve month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm Inc. in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. The alternate base rate is the greater of (1) Credit Suisse’s prime rate or
(2) 50 basis points over the weighted average of rates on overnight Federal funds as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The adjusted LIBO rate is determined by reference to settlement rates established for deposits in dollars in
the London interbank market for a period equal to the interest period of the loan as adjusted for the maximum reserve percentages established by the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve. The applicable margin percentage is a
percentage per annum equal to (1) 1.00% for alternate base rate term loans, (2) 2.00% for adjusted LIBO rate term loans, and (3) in the case of alternate base rate revolving loans and adjusted LIBO rate revolving loans, a percentage
which varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio of TransDigm Inc. as of the relevant date of determination.

Under the
terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay the administrative agent certain fees. In addition, on the last day of each calendar quarter the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% of any unused
commitments under the revolving credit line and certain other fees in respect of letters of credit that may be outstanding thereunder from time to time.

The term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the agreement) if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 4.50 to 1.00 for the
Company’s fiscal year or if the term loans do not achieve certain minimum credit ratings at the end of such fiscal year. “Consolidated Leverage Ratio” means the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to the aggregate amount of
EBITDA As Defined, calculated on a pro forma basis. TransDigm’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 4.2 to 1.00 at September 30, 2010, thus the Company was not obligated to make the prepayment of the term loans based upon the
excess cash flow provision.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by TD Group and all of TransDigm Inc.’s
current domestic restricted subsidiaries, and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing

F-15


property and assets, including inventory, equipment, general intangibles, intellectual property, investment property and other personal property (but excluding leasehold interests, deposit
accounts and certain other assets) of TransDigm Inc. and all of TransDigm Inc.’s existing domestic restricted subsidiaries, and a first priority pledge of the capital stock of TransDigm Inc. and TransDigm Inc.’s domestic subsidiaries and
65% of the voting capital stock of TransDigm Inc.’s foreign subsidiaries.

The agreement also
contains a number of restrictive covenants restricting or limiting the ability of TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and TransDigm Inc.’s direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or
issue preferred stock, pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt, make investments, sell assets, enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted
subsidiaries to us, incur liens, consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, create unrestricted subsidiaries, and engage in certain business activities. Such negative covenants are
subject to certain exceptions. The negative covenants are substantially identical to the corresponding negative covenants of the


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes. In addition, the
Senior Secured Credit Facility includes a financial maintenance covenant requiring that TransDigm comply, on a pro forma basis, with a consolidated secured debt ratio test. Such covenant, however, inures only to the benefit of the revolving lenders.
TransDigm is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

Senior Subordinated Notes

—The 7

Senior Subordinated Notes and Special Cash
Dividend Payment

—In October 2009 TD Group’s wholly owned subsidiary, TransDigm Inc., completed the offering of $425 million of

% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a
discount, receiving net proceeds of $412.8 million. After the payment of debt issue fees and expenses, the net proceeds amounted to approximately $404.2 million. TransDigm Inc. used the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to make a cash
distribution to TD Group which, in turn, made a special cash dividend to its stockholders of $7.65 per share and cash dividend equivalent payments (“Dividend Equivalent Payments”) to holders of options to purchase its common stock. The
special cash dividend amounting to $374.6 million was paid on October 26, 2009 and the Dividend Equivalent Payments amounting to approximately $30.3 million were paid in October and November 2009.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, which together cover certain union employees. The plans provide benefits of stated
amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute actuarially determined amounts allowable under Internal Revenue Service regulations. The Company uses a September 30

th

measurement date for its defined benefit pension plans.

F-16


The plan assets as of
September 30, 2010 and 2009 were $6.7 million. The Company’s accumulated benefit obligation for its defined benefit pension plans at September 30, 2010 and 2009 was $9.6 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The total liability
recognized at September 30, 2010 and 2009 was $2.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The net period pension cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income as of September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $0.3 million.

Defined Contribution Plans

—The Company sponsors certain defined contribution employee savings plans that
cover substantially all of the Company’s non-union employees. Under the plans, the Company contributes a percentage of employee compensation and matches a portion of employee contributions. The cost recognized for such contributions for the
years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $2.6 million, $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and local jurisdictions. The
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years before fiscal year 2007. In addition, the Company is subject to state and local income tax examinations for fiscal years 2006 through 2010.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

Unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2010 and 2009, the recognition of which would have an effect
on the effective tax rate for each fiscal year, amounted to $1.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The Company classifies all income tax related interest and penalties as income tax expense. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
2010 and 2009, the Company recognized $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, in income tax interest and penalties. As of September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company accrued $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for the potential
payment of interest and penalties. The Company anticipates no significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits through fiscal 2010.

CAPITAL STOCK

Capital Stock

—Authorized capital stock of TD Group consists of 224,400,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock and
149,600,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock. The total number of shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2010 and 2009 was 49,928,241 and 49,448,028, respectively. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at
September 30, 2010 and 2009. The terms of the preferred stock have not been established.

On October 23, 2008, the
Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program, which was announced on October 27, 2008. Under the terms of the program, the Company may purchase up to a maximum aggregate value of $50 million of its shares of common stock. At
September 30, 2010, the Company had repurchased under this program 494,100 shares of its common stock at a gross cost of approximately $15.2 million.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock compensation plans are designed to assist the Company in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding key
employees, directors or consultants, and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders by closely aligning the interests of these individuals with those of the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s stock compensation plans
provide for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives.

The following table shows the
expense recognized by the Company for stock-based compensation (in thousands):

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $18.83, $10.45 and $13.66, respectively.

As of September 30, 2010, there was
$21.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards expected to vest, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of three years.

The fair value of the Company’s employee stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for all
options granted during the fiscal years ended:

F-19


The risk-free interest
rate is based upon the Treasury bond rates as of the grant date. The average expected life of stock-based awards is based on vesting schedules and contractual terms. Expected volatility of stock was calculated using a rate based upon the historical
volatility of publicly traded companies in the Company’s peer group in the aerospace industry. This was used because TD Group’s common stock has only been publicly traded since March 2006. Notwithstanding the special cash dividend paid in
October 2009, the Company historically has not paid regular cash dividends and does not anticipate paying regular cash dividends in future periods; thus, no dividend rate assumption is used.

The total fair value of shares vested during fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $4.6 million, $4.9 million
and $5.1 million, respectively.

2006 Stock Incentive Plan

In conjunction with the consummation of the initial public offering, a 2006 stock incentive plan was adopted by TD Group. In July 2008,
the plan was amended to increase the number of shares available for issuance thereunder. TD Group has reserved 4,119,668 shares of its common stock for issuance to key employees, directors or consultants under the plan. Awards under the plan may be
in the form of options, restricted stock or other stock-based awards. Options granted under the plan will expire no later than the tenth anniversary of the applicable date of grant of the options, and will have an exercise price of not less than the
fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock granted under the plan vests over three years.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, 1,826 shares of common stock were issued with a weighted-average grant date fair
value of $57.45.

stock-based award activity during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010:

At September 30, 2010, 1,090,635 remaining shares were available for award under TD Group’s 2006
stock incentive plan.

2003 Stock Option Plan

Certain executives and key employees of the Company were granted stock options under TD Group’s 2003 stock option plan. Upon the
closing of the acquisition of the Company by Warburg Pincus in 2003, certain employees rolled over certain then-existing options to purchase shares of common stock of TransDigm Holdings. These employees were granted rollover options to purchase an
aggregate of 3,870,152 shares of common stock of TD Group (after giving effect to the 149.60 for 1.00 stock split effected on March 14, 2006). All rollover options granted were fully vested on the date of grant. In addition to shares of common
stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of rollover options, an aggregate of 5,469,301 shares of TD Group’s common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of new management options. In general, approximately 20% of all new
management options vested based on employment service or a change in control. These time vested options have a graded vesting schedule of up to four years. Approximately 80% of all new management options vested (i) based upon the satisfaction
of specified performance criteria, which is annual and cumulative EBITDA As Defined targets through 2008, or (ii) upon the occurrence of a change in control if the Investor Group (defined as Warburg Pincus and the other initial investors in TD
Group) received a minimum specified rate of return. Unless terminated earlier, the options expire ten years from the date of grant. All of the outstanding performance options were vested as of September 30, 2010.

TD Group has reserved a total of 9,339,453 shares of its common stock for issuance to the Company’s employees under the plan,
9,261,624 of which had been issued as of September 30, 2010.

Dividend
Equivalent Plans

Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated TransDigm Group Incorporated 2003 Stock Option Plan
Dividend Equivalent Plan and the Second Amended and Restated TransDigm Group Incorporated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan, all of the options granted under the 2003 stock option plan and the 2006 stock incentive plan are entitled
to certain dividend equivalent payments in the event of the declaration of a dividend by the Company. Options granted outside the plans to directors are also entitled to comparable dividend equivalents. The Company declared a special dividend of
$7.65 per share in October 2009. See Note 11. As a result, holders of outstanding options received dividend equivalents of approximately $30.3 million in the aggregate. In addition, to the extent unvested options outstanding on the dividend
declaration date vest, such options will be entitled to receive a dividend equivalent payment in the amount of $7.65 per share at the time of vesting.

LEASES

TransDigm leases
certain manufacturing facilities with annual rental payments required through December 2020. One of the facility leases is with a company in which one of our employees is an owner. The term of the lease is through December 2014, although it may be
terminated early under certain circumstances. The base rental for the property is $0.6 million per year. TransDigm also leases office space for its corporate headquarters. The office space leases require annual rental payments of approximately $0.2
million per year through fiscal 2015.

TransDigm also has commitments under operating leases for vehicles and equipment.
Rental expense during the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $4.2 million, $3.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments at September 30, 2010 under operating leases having initial or
remaining non-cancelable lease terms exceeding one year are $4.0 million in fiscal 2011, $3.3 million in fiscal 2012, $2.3 million in fiscal 2013, $1.9 million in fiscal 2014, $1.4 million in fiscal 2015, and $5.6 million thereafter.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The following tables present our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the
fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates in the normal course of business. The Company’s risk management program is designed to manage the exposure and
volatility arising from these risks, and utilizes derivative financial instruments to offset a portion of these risks. The Company uses derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to hedge identified business risks, and does not
enter into such transactions for trading purposes. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security with counterparties to these financial instruments and is therefore subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance;
however, the Company monitors credit risk and currently does not anticipate nonperformance by other parties.

Interest rate
swap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floating-rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $780 million. The interest rate swap agreements utilized by the Company effectively modify the Company’s
exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of the Company’s floating-rate debt to a fixed rate basis through the expiration dates of the agreements, thereby reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.
These agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts. These derivative instruments qualify as effective
cash flow hedges under GAAP. For these hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instrument is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and
subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line as the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.

At September 30, 2010, one agreement was in place to swap variable interest rates on the Senior Secured Credit Facility for fixed interest rates for the notional amount of $300 million through
March 23, 2011. This interest rate swap agreement effectively converts the variable rate interest on the notional amount of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 3.04% plus the 2% margin percentage, over the term of the
agreement.

An additional interest
rate swap agreement on a notional amount of $150 million expired on June 23, 2009. This interest rate swap agreement effectively converted the variable rate interest on the notional amount of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to a fixed rate
of 5.63% plus the 2% margin percentage, over the term of the agreement.

The net after-tax derivative loss included in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is expected to be reclassified into interest expense in conjunction with the recognition of interest payments on the notional amounts of the swap contract, with a net $2.4 million of after-tax net loss
expected to be recognized in interest expense within the next year.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On
September 25, 2010, TransDigm entered into a definitive agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with McKechnie Holdings LLC to purchase all of the outstanding stock of McKechnie Aerospace Holdings, Inc. (“McKechnie”), a
privately owned supplier of innovative aerospace products controlled by JLL Partners Inc., for a total purchase price on a cash-free, debt-free basis of approximately $1,265 million in cash. The Purchase Agreement contains representations,
warranties, covenants and conditions that we believe are customary for a transaction of this size and type, as well as indemnification provisions subject to specified limitations. The

F-25


closing of the McKechnie acquisition, which is expected before the end of the calendar year, is subject to several conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, and there can be
no assurance that the McKechnie acquisition will be consummated as contemplated, or at all. We intend to finance the McKechnie acquisition and concurrently refinance a portion of our existing indebtedness through a combination of senior subordinated
notes and borrowings under a new senior secured credit facility.

We have evaluated events subsequent to September 30,
2010, through the date the financial statements were issued, and determined that no events have occurred that require adjustment of or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, other than as disclosed above.
