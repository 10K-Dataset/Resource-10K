PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Unum Group, a Delaware general business corporation, and its insurance and
non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively with Unum Group we refer to as the Company, operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, and, to a limited extent, in certain other countries around the world. The principal operating subsidiaries
in the United States are Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum America), Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company (Provident), The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company (Paul Revere Life), and Colonial Life & Accident Insurance
Company, and in the United Kingdom, Unum Limited. We are the largest provider of disability insurance products in the United States and the United Kingdom. We also provide a complementary portfolio of other insurance products, including employer-
and employee-paid group benefits, life insurance, long-term care insurance, and other related services.

We have three major business
segments: Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial Life. Our other segments are the Individual Disability – Closed Block segment and the Corporate and Other segment. These segments are discussed more fully under “Reporting Segments” included
herein in Item 1.

Business Strategies

As one of the leading providers of employee benefits in the U.S. and the U.K., we offer a broad portfolio of products and services to meet the diverse and rapidly changing needs of employers and their
employees. Specifically, we offer group, individual, and voluntary benefits — either as stand-alone products or combined with other coverages — that create comprehensive benefits solutions for employers of all sizes by helping them attract
and retain a stronger workforce while protecting the incomes and lifestyles of their employees. We believe employer-sponsored benefits represent the single most effective way to provide workers with access to the information and options they need to
protect their lifestyle and provide financial security. Working people and their families, particularly those at middle and lower incomes, are perhaps the most vulnerable in today’s economy yet are often overlooked by many providers of
financial services and products. For many of these people, employer-sponsored benefits are the primary defense against the potentially catastrophic fallout of death, illness, or injury.

We have established a corporate culture consistent with the social values our products provide. We are committed to not only meeting the needs of our customers who depend on us, but also to operating with
integrity and being accountable for our actions. Our sound and consistent business practices, strong internal compliance program, and comprehensive risk management strategy enable us to operate efficiently as well as to identify and address
potential areas of risk from all corners of our business. We have also applied these same values to our social responsibility efforts. Because we see important links between the obligations we have to all of our stakeholders, we place a strong
emphasis on contributing to positive change in our communities.

We are an industry leader, and we believe we are well-positioned in our
sector with solid long-term growth prospects. Given the nature of our business, however, we are sensitive to economic and financial market movements, including consumer confidence, employment levels, and interest rates. Our business outlook, which
recognizes both the challenges of the current economic environment as well as the mitigating impact of risk-reducing actions we have taken in recent years, is consistent with our risk appetite. Although the occurrence of one or more of the risk
factors discussed herein may cause our results to differ materially from our outlook, our business plan has been tested against a variety of economic scenarios, and we believe we can continue to meet the challenges presented by the current economic
environment. We remain cautious of the near-term outlook for employment levels and wages, both of which limit opportunities for premium growth, but we believe we are poised to profitably grow as employment trends improve.



Index to Financial Statements

During 2011, our focus will remain on disciplined top-line growth and capital management. Objectives for the
year include:

•

Continue to consistently execute against our operating plans, which emphasize disciplined, profitable growth;

•

Further enhance our financial flexibility through solid operating and investment performance and a sustainable capital deployment strategy;

•

Leverage our capabilities, products, relationships, and reputation to deliver on our commitments as well as our bottom-line targets;

•

Continue to invest in our businesses and leverage global capabilities to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities.

Reporting Segments

Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum UK, Colonial Life, Individual Disability – Closed Block, and Corporate and Other. Measured as a percentage of consolidated premium
income for the year ended December 31, 2010, premium income was approximately 65.3 percent for the Unum US segment, 8.8 percent for Unum UK, 14.5 percent for Colonial Life, and 11.4 percent for the Individual Disability – Closed Block and
Corporate and Other segments combined.

Financial information is provided in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 and Note 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8.

Unum US Segment

The Unum US segment includes group long-term and short-term disability insurance, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and
supplemental and voluntary lines of business. The supplemental and voluntary lines of business are comprised of recently issued disability insurance, group and individual long-term care insurance, and voluntary benefits products. These products are
issued primarily by Unum America, Provident, and Paul Revere Life. Paul Revere Life no longer actively markets new business but continues to service its existing business. Premium income for this segment totaled $4,854.6 million in 2010. These
products are marketed through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants. We discontinued selling individual long-term care insurance in 2009.

Group Long-term and Short-term Disability

Group long-term and short-term disability products contributed approximately 42.7 percent of the Unum US segment premium income in 2010. We sell group long-term and short-term disability products to
employers for the benefit of employees. Group long-term disability provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or injury. We offer services to employers and insureds to
encourage and facilitate rehabilitation, retraining, and re-employment. Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or 180 day waiting periods and continue providing benefits until the employee reaches a certain age, generally between 65 and
70. The benefits are limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income.

Group short-term disability insurance generally provides
coverage from loss of income due to injury or sickness, effective immediately for accidents and after one week for sickness, for up to 26 weeks, limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income.

Premiums for group long-term and short-term disability are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for
administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Some cases carry experience rating provisions. Premiums for experience-rated group long-term and short-term disability business are based on the expected experience of the client given its
demographics, industry group, and location, adjusted for the credibility of the specific claim experience of the client. We also offer accounts handled on an administrative services only (ASO) basis, with the responsibility for funding claim
payments remaining with the customer. Both group long-term and short-term disability are sold primarily on a basis permitting periodic repricing to address the underlying claims experience.



Index to Financial Statements

We have defined underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age
and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability. Policies are typically issued, both at inception and renewal, with rate guarantees. For new group policyholders, the usual rate guarantee is one to three
years. For group policies being renewed, the rate guarantee is generally one year, but may be longer. The profitability of the policy depends on the adequacy of the rate during the rate guarantee period. The contracts provide for certain
circumstances in which the rate guarantees can be overridden.

Profitability of group long-term and short-term disability insurance is
affected by claims experience, investment returns, persistency, and the level of administrative expenses. Morbidity is an important factor in disability claims experience, and many economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence for
disability insurance. In general, experience-rated disability coverage for large groups has narrower profit margins and represents less risk to us than business of this type sold to small employers because we bear all of the risk of adverse claims
experience in small case fully insured coverages while larger employers often bear much of this risk themselves. We routinely make pricing adjustments, when contractually permitted, which take into account the emerging experience on our group
insurance products.

Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment

Group life and accidental death and dismemberment products contributed approximately 24.7 percent of the Unum US segment premium income in 2010. Group
life and accidental death and dismemberment products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Group life consists primarily of renewable term life insurance with the coverages frequently linked to employees’ wages and includes a
provision for waiver of premium, if disabled. Accidental death and dismemberment consists primarily of an additional benefit amount payable if death or severe injury is attributable to an accident.

Premiums are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.
Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those used for group disability products, and evidence of insurability is required for benefits in excess of a specified limit.

Profitability of group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance is affected by claims experience, investment returns, persistency, and the level of administrative expenses.

Individual Disability – Recently Issued

Individual disability – recently issued products generated approximately 9.4 percent of the Unum US segment premium income in 2010. Individual disability – recently issued generally consists of
those individual disability policies issued after the substantial changes in product offerings, pricing, distribution, and underwriting which occurred during the period 1994 through 1998 and were generally implemented to improve the overall risk
profile of the product. Individual disability is offered primarily to multi-life employer groups, but the policy is owned by the employee and is portable should the employee change employers. Individual disability insurance provides the insured with
a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury. Under an individual disability policy, monthly benefits generally are fixed at the time the policy is written. The benefits typically range from 30 percent to 75 percent of the
insured’s monthly earned income. We provide various options with respect to length of benefit periods and waiting periods before benefit payments begin, which permits tailoring of the policy to a specific policyholder’s needs. We also
market individual disability policies which include payments for the transfer of business ownership between partners and payments for business overhead expenses. Individual disability products do not provide for the accumulation of cash values.

Premium rates for individual disability products vary by age, gender, and occupation based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality,
persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience. Our underwriters evaluate the medical and financial condition of prospective policyholders prior to
the issuance of a policy. For larger multi-life groups, some underwriting requirements may be waived. The majority of our individual disability – recently issued policies are written on a noncancelable basis. Under a noncancelable policy, as
long as the insured continues to pay the fixed annual premium for the policy’s duration, we cannot cancel the policy or raise the premium.



Index to Financial Statements

Profitability of individual disability insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims
experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Group and Individual Long-term Care

Long-term care products generated approximately 12.3 percent of the Unum US segment premium income in 2010. Group long-term care insurance is offered to
employers for the benefit of employees. Individual long-term care, which we discontinued selling in 2009, was previously marketed on a single-life customer basis. Long-term care insurance pays a benefit upon the loss of two or more activities of
daily living and the insured’s requirement of standby assistance or cognitive impairment. Payment is made on an indemnity basis, regardless of expenses incurred, up to a lifetime maximum. Benefits begin after a waiting period, generally 90 days
or less.

Premium rates for long-term care vary by age and gender and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency,
administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Underwriting for group long-term care insurance is based primarily on the age and
gender of the insured and certain characteristics of the group. There is an “active at work” requirement for insurability, and for coverage above a stated maximum, we evaluate the medical condition of the prospective individual insureds.
Long-term care insurance is offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval.

Profitability is affected by claims experience, investment returns, persistency, and the level of administrative expenses.

Voluntary Benefits

Voluntary benefits products generated approximately 10.9 percent of
the Unum US segment premium income in 2010. Voluntary benefits products are sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace and include individual universal life and interest-sensitive life, individual disability, group and
individual critical illness, and individual cancer products.

Premium rates for voluntary benefits products are based on assumptions
concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Our underwriters evaluate the medical
condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy on a simplified basis. For larger groups with high participation rates, some underwriting requirements may be waived. Voluntary benefits products other than life insurance are
offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval.

Profitability of
voluntary benefits products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Unum UK Segment

The Unum UK segment includes insurance for group long-term
disability, group life, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business. The supplemental and voluntary lines of business are comprised of individual disability, group and individual critical illness, and, more recently, voluntary benefits
products. These products are issued by Unum Limited and are sold primarily in the United Kingdom through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants. Premium income for this segment totaled $650.6 million in 2010, or
£420.6 million in local currency.

Group Long-term Disability

Group long-term disability products contributed approximately 64.7 percent of the Unum UK segment premium income in 2010. Group long-term disability
products are sold to employers for the benefit of employees. Group long-term disability provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or injury. Services are offered to employers
and insureds to encourage and facilitate

rehabilitation, retraining, and re-employment. Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or 180 day waiting periods and continue providing benefits until the employee reaches a certain
age, generally between 60 and 65. The benefits are limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income.

Premiums for group long-term
disability are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Some cases carry experience rating provisions. Premiums for experience-rated group long-term
disability business are based on the expected experience of the client given its demographics, industry group, and location, adjusted for the credibility of the specific claim experience of the client.

We have defined underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a
prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability. Policies are typically issued, both at inception and renewal, with rate guarantees. In both cases the usual rate guarantee is two years. Guarantees of one year may be
offered either at the request of the client or as required by us to manage risk.

In a very limited number of circumstances
guarantees of three years may be offered, but this will be at an additional cost. The profitability of the policy is dependent upon the adequacy of the rate during the rate guarantee period. The contracts provide for certain circumstances in
which the rate guarantees can be overridden.

Profitability of group long-term disability insurance is affected by claims experience,
investment returns, persistency, and the level of administrative expenses. Morbidity is an important factor in disability claims experience.

Group Life

Group life products contributed approximately 26.4 percent of the Unum UK
segment premium income in 2010. Group life products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Group life consists of two types of products, a renewable term life insurance product providing a lump sum benefit to the beneficiary on death of
an employee and a group dependent life product which provides an annuity to the beneficiary on death of an employee. Both coverages are frequently linked to employees’ wages. Premiums for group life are generally based on expected claims of a
pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products.

Profitability of group life is affected by claims experience, investment returns, persistency, and the level of administrative expenses.

Individual Disability

Individual disability products generated approximately 5.2 percent of the Unum UK segment premium income in 2010. Individual disability is offered
primarily to individual retail customers. Individual disability insurance provides the insured with a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury. Under an individual disability policy, monthly benefits generally are fixed at the
time the policy is written. The benefits typically range from 30 percent to 50 percent of the insured’s monthly earned income. Various options with respect to length of benefit periods and waiting periods before payment begins are available and
permit tailoring of the policy to a specific policyholder’s needs. Individual disability products do not provide for the accumulation of cash values.

Premium rates for individual disability products vary by age, gender, and occupation based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and
profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Our underwriters evaluate the medical and financial condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy.
Approximately one half of our individual disability policies are written on a noncancelable basis. The remainder is offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies.

Profitability of individual disability insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative
expenses.



Index to Financial Statements

Critical Illness

Critical illness products generated approximately 3.7 percent of the Unum UK segment premium income in 2010. Group critical illness products, previously reported with group long-term disability, are sold
to groups of employees. Individual critical illness products, previously reported with individual disability, are offered to individual retail customers. Critical illness products provide a lump-sum benefit on the occurrence of a covered critical
illness event.

Premiums for group critical illness products are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions
for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products. Premium rates for individual critical illness products vary by age and gender based
on assumptions concerning morbidity, persistency, administrative expenses, and investment income. Individual critical illness insurance is offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies. We develop our
assumptions based on our own claims experience and published industry tables. Our underwriters evaluate the medical condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy.

Profitability of these products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, claims experience, investment returns, and the level of administrative expenses.

Voluntary Benefits

Unum UK launched its initial voluntary benefits product offering in the U.K. marketplace during the fourth quarter of 2010. The product offering includes
group disability, group life, and group critical illness products. These products are sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace.

Premium rates for voluntary benefits products are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions
based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. The extent of underwriting for these policies is based on guaranteed issue amounts, size of policy, and participation percentage. Policies include rate guarantees at
inception and at renewal, generally for a period of two years.

Profitability of voluntary benefits products is affected by the level of
employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Colonial Life Segment

The Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident
Insurance Company and marketed to employees at the workplace through an agency sales force and brokers. Premium income for this segment totaled $1,075.7 million in 2010.

Accident, Sickness, and Disability

The accident, sickness, and disability product line,
which generated approximately 61.5 percent of the Colonial Life segment premium income in 2010, consists of short-term disability plans as well as accident-only plans providing benefits for injuries on a specified loss basis. It also includes
accident and health plans covering hospital admissions, confinement, and surgeries on an indemnity basis and group limited benefit medical plans which provide limited indemnity benefits for basic healthcare expenses.

Premiums for accident, sickness, and disability products are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative
expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience. Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable wherein we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis.
A small percentage of the policies are written on a group basis wherein we retain the right to change premiums at the individual account level. We have defined underwriting practices and procedures for each of our products. Most policies are issued
on a simplified issue basis, based on answers to simple health and employment questions. If the amount applied for exceeds certain levels, the applicant may be asked to answer additional health questions or submit to additional medical examinations.



Index to Financial Statements

Profitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, claims experience, investment
returns, and the level of administrative expenses.

The accident and health products qualify as fringe benefits that can be purchased with
pre-tax employee dollars as part of a flexible benefits program pursuant to Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. Flexible benefits programs assist employers in managing benefit and compensation packages and provide policyholders the
ability to choose benefits that best meet their needs. Laws could be changed to limit or eliminate fringe benefits available on a pre-tax basis, eliminating our ability to continue marketing our products this way. However, we believe our products
provide value to our policyholders that will remain even if the tax advantages offered by flexible benefits programs are modified or eliminated.

Life

Group and individual life products contributed approximately 16.4 percent of the
Colonial Life segment premium income in 2010 and are primarily comprised of universal life, whole life, level term life, and a small block of group term life policies.

Premium rates vary by age and gender and are based on assumptions concerning mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own
claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Premiums for the whole life and level term products are guaranteed for the life of the contract. Premiums for the universal life products are flexible and may vary at the individual
policyholder level. For the group term life product, we retain the right to change premiums at the account level based on the experience of the account.

Profitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, claims experience, investment returns, and the level of administrative expenses.

Cancer and Critical Illness

Cancer and critical illness policies generated approximately 22.1 percent of the Colonial Life segment premium income in 2010. Cancer policies provide various benefits for the treatment of cancer
including hospitalization, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Critical illness policies provide a lump-sum benefit on the occurrence of a covered critical illness event.

Premiums are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and
persistency experience. Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable wherein we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis.

Profitability of these products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, claims experience, investment returns, and the level of administrative expenses.

Individual Disability – Closed Block Segment

The Individual Disability – Closed Block segment generally consists of those individual disability policies in-force before the substantial changes in product offerings, pricing, distribution, and
underwriting, which generally occurred during the period 1994 through 1998. A small amount of new business continued to be sold after these changes, but we stopped selling new policies in this segment at the beginning of 2004 other than update
features contractually allowable on existing policies. Premium income for this segment totaled $847.0 million in 2010.

The majority of the
policies included in this segment represent individual disability insurance which was written on a noncancelable basis. Profitability is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

We have reinsurance agreements in place providing for reimbursement of a proportion of losses in excess of an attachment point and for which
such losses are capped by a maximum loss limit.



Index to Financial Statements

Corporate and Other Segment

The Corporate and Other segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on
corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business. Corporate and Other also includes results from certain Unum US insurance products not actively marketed, including
individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, group pension, health insurance, and individual annuities.

Premium income for the insurance products in this segment totaled $3.5 million in 2010. We expect operating revenue and income from these insurance products to decline over time as these business lines
wind down.

Reinsurance

In
the normal course of business, we assume reinsurance from and cede reinsurance to other insurance companies. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it
has issued for an agreed upon premium. The primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to limit losses from large exposures. However, if the assuming reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations, we remain contingently liable. We evaluate the financial
condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure. We may also require assets to be held in trust, letters of credit, or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable
balances.

In general, the maximum amount of risk retained by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries and not ceded is $750,000 per covered life per
policy under a group or individual life policy and $750,000 per covered life per policy under a group or individual accidental death and dismemberment policy. For Unum Limited, we generally retain £1.0 million per covered life. The amount
of risk retained on individual disability products varies by policy type and year of issue. Other than catastrophic reinsurance coverage, we generally do not reinsure group or individual disability policies issued subsequent to 1999.

We have global catastrophic reinsurance coverage which includes four layers of coverage to limit our exposure under life, accidental death and
dismemberment, long-term care, and disability policies in regards to a catastrophic event. We have 50 percent reinsurance coverage in the first layer and 80 percent coverage in the other three layers for a total of $305.0 million of
catastrophic reinsurance coverage, after a $50.0 million deductible. Each of the first two layers provides $50.0 million of coverage, the third layer provides $100.0 million of coverage, and the fourth layer provides $200.0 million of coverage.
Each layer provides coverage for all catastrophic events, including acts of war and any type of terrorism. In addition to the global catastrophic reinsurance coverage noted above, Unum Limited has an additional catastrophic treaty integrated with
the global treaty to limit the exposure under group life and group dependent policies as a result of a catastrophic event. The coverage is placed at 100 percent for a total of £150.0 million of catastrophic reinsurance coverage,
after a £200.0 million deductible. The coverage is for all catastrophic events, including acts of war and any type of terrorism. Events may occur which limit or eliminate the availability of catastrophic reinsurance coverage in
future years.

The reinsurance recoverable of $4,827.9 million at December 31, 2010 relates to 93 companies. Fourteen major companies
account for approximately 91 percent of the reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2010, and all of these companies are rated A or better by A.M. Best Company (AM Best) or are fully securitized by letters of credit or investment-grade fixed
maturity securities held in trust. Of the remaining reinsurance recoverable, approximately eight percent relates to business reinsured either with companies rated A- or better by AM Best, with overseas entities with equivalent ratings or backed by
letters of credit or trust agreements, or through reinsurance arrangements wherein we retain the assets in our general account. Approximately one percent of the reinsurance recoverable is held by companies either rated below A- by AM Best or not
rated.

The collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. Although we
have controls to minimize our exposure, the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Item 1A and Note 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8.

Reserves for
Policy and Contract Benefits

The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as
liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts which, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are
calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates,
and methods of valuation.

The reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries. These differences result from the use of mortality and
morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods.

The assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are
payable. If actual experience is not less favorable than our reserve assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be
required. The key experience assumptions include disability claim incidence rates, disability claim recovery rates, mortality rates, policy persistency, and interest rates. We periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new
issues and reserves for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.

The consolidated statements of income include the annual change in
reserves for future policy and contract benefits. The change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses, deaths, and benefit payments.

For further discussion of reserves, refer to “Risk Factors” contained herein in Item 1A, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and the
discussion of segment operating results included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7, and Note 5 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” contained herein in Item 8.

Investments

Investment activities are an integral part of our business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results. We segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various
product lines. Generally, our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our
businesses. We seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner, subject to constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations. Our overall investment philosophy is to invest
in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products. Assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities. Changes in interest rates may affect the
amount and timing of cash flows.

We actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to
limit interest rate risk. We may redistribute investments between our different lines of business, when necessary, to adjust the cash flow and/or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability
portfolios. Asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy. Cash flows from the in-force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current
interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios. These results enable us to assess the impact of



Index to Financial Statements

projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to
choose the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes. We use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and the
risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Refer to “Risk Factors” contained herein in Item 1A, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and the discussion of investments in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 2, 3, and 4 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in
Item 8 for information on our investments and derivative financial instruments.

Ratings

AM Best, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), and Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) are among the
third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. Issuer credit ratings reflect an agency’s opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior debt
obligations. Financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency’s view of the overall financial strength (capital levels, earnings, growth, investments, business mix, operating
performance, and market position) of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and
are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.

Rating agencies assign an outlook statement of “positive,”
“negative,” or “developing” to indicate an intermediate-term trend in credit fundamentals which could lead to a rating change. “Positive” means that a rating may be raised, “negative” means that a rating may
be lowered, and “developing” means that a rating may be raised or lowered with equal probability. Alternatively, a rating may have a “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change.

“Credit watch” or “under review” highlights the potential direction of a short-term or long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable
events and short-term trends that cause a rating to be placed under heightened surveillance by a rating agency. Events that may trigger this action include mergers, acquisitions, recapitalizations, or anticipated operating developments. Ratings may
be placed on credit watch or under review when an event or a change in an expected trend occurs and additional information is needed to evaluate the current rating level. This status does not mean that a rating change is inevitable, and ratings may
change without first being placed on a watch list.

Our financial strength ratings as of February 2011 for our principal U.S. domiciled
insurance company subsidiaries were:

•

A (Excellent) by AM Best – 3rd of 15 rankings

•

A (Strong) by Fitch – 6th of 23 rankings

•

A3 (Good) by Moody’s – 7th of 21 rankings

•

A- (Strong) by S&P – 7th of 21 rankings

Our issuer credit ratings for Unum Group as of February 2011 were:

•

bbb (Good) by AM Best – 9th of 22 rankings

•

BBB (Good) by Fitch – 9th of 21 rankings

•

Baa3 (Moderate) by Moody’s – 10th of 21 rankings

•

BBB- (Good) by S&P – 10th of 22 rankings

As of February 2011, all four rating agencies have a “stable” outlook for our Company. None of the ratings are currently under review or on credit watch. See further discussion in “Risk
Factors” contained herein in Item 1A and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Ratings” contained herein in Item 7. A rating is not a recommendation to buy,
sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Competition

There is intense competition among insurance companies for the types of products we sell. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are integrated product choices, price,
quality of customer service and claims management, financial strength, and claims-paying ratings. In the individual and group disability markets, we compete in the United States with a limited number of major companies and regionally with other
companies offering specialty products. Our principal competitors for our other products, including group life and long-term care as well as the product offerings sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction, include the largest insurance
companies in the United States. Some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claims-paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete.

In the United Kingdom, we compete for individual and group products with a number of large internationally recognized
providers. The life insurance market continues to go through a restructuring phase which has led to opportunities for both the strong specialist supplier and also new organizations that have recently been established to handle the
run-off of closed businesses. Current penetration levels indicate that there is still significant upside growth potential in the United Kingdom for the types of products we offer.

All areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of the products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market.
There is a risk that purchasers of employee benefits products may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a result, adversely affect the persistency of these and
other products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

We must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively
market our products. Strong competition exists among insurers for agents and brokers. We compete with other insurers for sales agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our product offerings, financial strength, support services, and
compensation. Sales of our products could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents and brokers.

For further discussion, refer to “Risk Factors” contained herein in Item 1A.

Regulation

General

Our
U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by insurance departments in jurisdictions in which they do business and by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on a national basis, primarily for the protection of
policyholders. Unum Limited is subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the U.K. The state insurance departments in the U.S. and the FSA in the U.K. have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the
insurance business and, in particular, monitor the manner in which an insurance company offers, sells, and administers its products. This monitoring may include reviewing sales practices, including the content and use of advertising materials and
the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers, as well as underwriting, claims, and customer service practices. The DOL enforces a comprehensive federal statute which regulates claims paying fiduciary responsibilities and reporting and
disclosure requirements for most employee benefit plans. Our domestic insurance subsidiaries must meet the standards and tests for investments imposed by state insurance laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. Domestic
insurance subsidiaries operate under insurance laws which require they establish and carry, as liabilities, statutory reserves to meet policyholder obligations. These reserves are verified periodically by various regulators. Our domestic insurance
subsidiaries are examined periodically by examiners from their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business. The domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of
protection of policyholders, but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing, such as market conduct issues. Other states more typically perform market conduct examinations that include a review of
a company’s sales practices, including advertising and licensing of agents and brokers, as well as underwriting, claims, and customer service practices to determine compliance with state laws.

Capital Requirements

Risk-based capital (RBC) standards for U.S. life insurance companies have been prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance
subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the RBC model formula of the NAIC, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers. The basis of the system is a risk-based formula
that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer’s business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. The life and health RBC formula is designed
to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow
due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks. The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized. The formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not
intended as a means to rank insurers generally.

The NAIC’s Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) began in June 2008. The SMI is a
self-examination of the United States’ insurance solvency regulation framework and includes a review of international developments regarding insurance supervision, banking supervision, and international accounting standards and their potential
use in U.S. insurance regulation. The SMI is a wide-ranging initiative that, by its nature, will evolve to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments. Current SMI goals and the principles developed through
the SMI’s exploration of capital requirements, group solvency, reinsurance, and international accounting will likely result in significant changes to U.S. insurance regulation and solvency standards.

Unum Limited is subject to regulation, including capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins, by the FSA in the U.K. Current solvency
standards require an insurance company to hold capital equal to the greater of (i) a formulaic calculation of capital related to liabilities or (ii) a risk-based assessment of capital which is company specific reflecting the insurance
company’s individual risk profile. Unum Limited will adopt new capital requirements and risk management standards, Solvency II, resulting from a fundamental review of the capital adequacy standards for the European insurance industry. Solvency
II will replace the current capital requirements for Unum Limited. Solvency II requirements are still being developed and have not yet been adopted, but the current proposals contain new requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for
insurers, including (i) requirements to demonstrate adequate financial resources, including quantitative requirements, technical provisions, and calculation of Solvency II capital requirements through either an approved full or partial internal
model or the European standard formula approach, (ii) requirements to demonstrate an adequate system of governance, including effective risk management and prospective risk identification, and (iii) disclosure and regulatory reporting
requirements. The effective adoption date is expected to be January 1, 2013.

Our Bermuda-based insurance subsidiary is subject to
regulation by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Last year the BMA initiated a comprehensive review of its insurance regulatory and solvency framework. Throughout 2010, the BMA published and released a series of consultation papers with
the stated purpose of being recognized as equivalent under the Solvency II directive. The BMA is working with European regulators and hopes to complete the assessment during the summer of 2011. The scope and scale of its proposed change is
potentially broad, and requirements are expected to vary by insurer licensing classification. It is too early to assess the impact, but the insurance industry may ultimately be subject to new rules regarding governance, administrative and
accounting processes, and/or long-term capital requirements.

See further discussion in “Risk Factors” contained herein in
Item 1A and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” contained herein in Item 7.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation

We are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (or deemed to be
commercially domiciled), which currently include Maine, Massachusetts, Tennessee, South Carolina, New York, Vermont, and California. These laws generally require each insurance company that is domiciled in the state and a member of an insurance
holding company system to register with the insurance department of that state and to furnish at least annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system, including intercompany transactions.

In addition, the laws of most states, including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (or deemed to be commercially
domiciled), require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company. Where these laws apply to us, there can be no effective change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless
the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change. The usual measure for a presumptive change of
control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company, although this presumption is rebuttable. Consequently, a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting
stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the state(s) of domicile of the insurance company(ies) sought to be acquired (or whose holding company is sought to be acquired) will be
in violation of these laws. Such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions: (i) injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the applicable insurance regulators; (ii) prohibition
of voting of such shares; and (iii) other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators. Further, many states’ insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a
non-domiciled insurance company doing business in the state. These pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control; however, they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if
particular conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have
adopted pre-notification laws.

These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change in control
of our Company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.

In addition, such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders, including our Company and certain of our
intermediate holding company subsidiaries. See further discussion in “Risk Factors” contained herein in Item 1A and “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Available from Subsidiaries” contained herein in Item 7.

We are also subject to regulation under applicable regulations and reporting requirements in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our
affiliates do business or have done business.

Federal Laws and Regulations

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services
in the United States, will subject us to potentially significant additional federal regulation. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to
occur over the next few years. Among other provisions impacting or potentially impacting us, Dodd-Frank:

•

Creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets, including requiring that certain swaps be executed through a
centralized exchange or regulated facility and be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse and subjecting major swap participants (potentially including our Company) to capital and margin (i.e., collateral) requirements, which may have the effect
of increasing the costs of hedging generally and the credit risk posed by some counterparties;



Index to Financial Statements

•

Establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council with authority to subject systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial
companies such as our Company) to supervision and stricter prudential regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, and credit
exposure, and in certain circumstances limitations on acquisitions or combinations, restrictions on product offerings, and/or requirements to sell assets; and

•

Establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry (other than with respect
to health insurance, certain long-term care insurance, and crop insurance), including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the U.S. financial system and
recommending insurers (potentially including our Company) that should be designated for stricter regulation.

The USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance
companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the
United States contain some similar provisions. The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law
enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions, require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures, and controls.

For further discussion of regulation, refer to “Risk Factors” contained herein in Item 1A.

Geographic Areas

Segment operating revenue, which excludes net realized investment gains
and losses, for our U.K. operations totaled $845.8 million, $828.2 million, and $1,086.1 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These amounts were approximately 8.3 percent, 8.2 percent, and 10.4 percent of consolidated segment operating
revenue for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, total assets and liabilities for our U.K. operations were $3.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, or approximately 6.3 percent and 5.2 percent of consolidated assets
and liabilities, respectively. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency of our U.K. operations will impact our reported operating results. See “Risk Factors” contained herein in Item 1A for further discussion of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 and Note 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures. Discussed below are certain factors that may adversely affect our
business, results of operations, or financial condition. Any one or more of the following factors may cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made
by or on behalf of the Company, including those in this document or made by us elsewhere, such as in earnings release investor calls, investor conference presentations, or press releases. The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the
only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” contained
herein on page 1.

Unfavorable economic conditions may result in lower premium growth, higher disability claims incidence, or longer claims
duration.

As a large financial institution, we are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the general economy, both in the
United States and in the United Kingdom. Adversity in the capital markets and the general economy may adversely affect our business and results of operations. In particular, factors such as unemployment levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer
spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our businesses. Given the nature
of our products, in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower personal income, reduced consumer spending, and lower corporate earnings and investment, new product sales may be adversely affected. Our premium growth may also
be negatively impacted by lower premium growth from existing customers due to lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy. In addition, during such periods we may experience higher disability
claims incidence, longer disability claims duration, and/or an increase in policy lapses.

We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to
extensive supervision and regulation, which may affect the cost or demand for our products, may increase capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries, or may impact our profitability or growth.

Our insurance company subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations, or may be able
to do so only at great cost. In addition, we may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Failure to comply
with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could result in fines and other sanctions, which may have a
material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

It is possible that there will be heightened oversight of insurers by
regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are domiciled and operate. We cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our
business, results of operations, or financial condition. The NAIC or state regulators may adopt revisions to the RBC formula, the FSA may revise its capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins, other jurisdictions in which our
subsidiaries operate, including the BMA, may increase their capital requirements, or rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses, thus requiring additional capital for our insurance subsidiaries.
Increased financial services regulation, such as the NAIC Solvency Modernization Initiative and the European Commission’s Solvency II, may impose greater quantitative requirements, supervisory review, and disclosure requirements and may impact
the business strategies, capital requirements, and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries.



Index to Financial Statements

New programs, including healthcare reform or financial services sector reform, may compete with or diminish
the need for our products, particularly as it may affect our ability to sell our products through employers or in the workplace.

Congress, as
well as foreign, state, and local governments, could enact legislation related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or could eliminate current tax deductions. Any of these events could increase our tax costs or affect the desirability of our products
to customers. Legislative changes related to pension funding requirements could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our profitability.

The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will subject us to potentially significant additional federal regulation. The requirements of the regulations ultimately
adopted could affect the financial markets generally and could impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and the requirement, availability, or cost of capital. See
“Regulation” contained herein in Item 1.

Most group long-term and short-term disability plans we administer are governed by
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Changes to ERISA enacted by Congress or via judicial interpretations may adversely affect the risk to us of managing employee benefit plans, increase the premiums associated with such plans, and
ultimately affect their affordability and our profitability.

The insurance departments in jurisdictions wherein our insurance subsidiaries
conduct business may limit our ability to obtain rate increases under guaranteed renewable contracts and may require changes in rates and/or benefits to meet minimum loss ratio requirements which could negatively impact the profitability of our
products.

Many regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents
and employees. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines or restrictions on our business activities and
may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Regulatory examinations or investigations could result in, among
other things, changes in our claims handling practices, changes in business practices, including changes in broker compensation and related disclosure practices, changes in the use and oversight of reinsurance, changes in governance and other
oversight procedures, fines, and other administrative action. Such results, singly or in combination, may injure our reputation, cause negative publicity, adversely affect our issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings, place us at a
competitive disadvantage in marketing or administering our products, or impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies, thereby adversely affecting our business, and potentially materially adversely affecting the results of operations.
Determination by regulatory authorities that we have engaged in improper conduct may also adversely affect our defense of various lawsuits. See “Regulation” contained herein in Item 1 and Note 13 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Sustained periods of low interest rates in the
long-term investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and our ability to purchase securities at rates of return assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products, which may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations or financial condition.

An interest, or discount, rate is used in calculating our policyholder reserves. We
set our reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. Continued low interest rates and yields on fixed
income investments may cause the rates of return on our investment portfolio to decrease more than expected, leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products. If the discount rate assumed in
our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments. In that case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient.

See “Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits” contained herein in Item 1 and “Critical
Accounting Estimates” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.

Changes in the risk results of our segments or lines of businesses may materially adversely affect our results or operations or financial condition.

In recent years, we have experienced improved risk results in various lines of business, with lower benefits and change in reserves for
future benefits relative to premium income. These results may not be indicative of future performance due to, among other things, changes in our mix of business, re-pricing of certain lines of business, or any number of economic cyclical effects on
our business. In addition, reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles, do not represent an exact calculation of future benefit liabilities but are instead estimates made by us using actuarial and statistical
procedures. Actual claim experience may differ from our reserve assumptions. There can be no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all circumstances. Future loss development may require reserves to be
increased, which would adversely affect earnings in current and future periods. Adjustments to reserve amounts may be required in the event of changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity (the incidence of claims and the rate of recovery,
including the effects thereon of inflation and other societal and economic factors); persistency; mortality (improved life expectancies may require an increase in reserves for long-tailed products such as individual disability and long-term care);
policy benefit offsets, including those for social security; and interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts. See “Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits” contained herein in Item 1 and “Critical Accounting
Estimates” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.

In addition to interest rate risk as previously discussed, we are exposed to other risks related to our investment portfolio which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition,
or liquidity. These risks include default risk, credit spread fluctuations, the contractual terms of derivative contracts, the accuracy of valuations of securities, and the possibility that we might need to sell securities at disadvantageous times.

Investments are an integral part of our business, and our investments support our policyholder liabilities and shareholders’ equity.
Our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities. These securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer. Factors such as an economic
downturn or political change in the country of the issuer, a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer’s industry, a significant deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer, unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by the
issuer, widening risk spreads, ratings downgrades, a change in the issuer’s marketplace or business prospects, or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these securities may result in the issuer defaulting on its obligations. Our
investment portfolio also includes perpetual debentures, or “hybrid” securities. Interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer. Because interest payments are deferrable and because these securities rank
behind traditional debt obligations, events that adversely affect the issuers of these securities may have a greater adverse effect on these types of investments than on our traditional fixed maturity securities.

Our mortgage loan portfolio has default risk. Events or developments, such as economic conditions that impact the ability of tenants to pay their rents
or limit the availability of refinancing, may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on an investment
portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated in that region or sector.

A default results in the recognition of an
other-than-temporary impairment loss on the investment. A default may also adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest due to us. The probability of credit downgrades and defaults increases when the fixed income markets experience
periods of volatility and illiquidity.

Our exposure to credit spreads, which is the yield above comparable Treasury securities, primarily
relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads may increase



Index to Financial Statements

the net unrealized loss position of the investment portfolio. Credit spread tightening may reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed income securities.

We use derivative instruments to help us manage interest rate risk. Risks to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity include:

•

Our hedges may become ineffective due to changes in expected future events for which we have hedged or if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor
their obligations under these derivative instruments. Ineffectiveness of our hedges may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

•

If we are downgraded significantly, ratings triggers in our contracts may result in our counterparties enforcing their option to terminate the
derivative contracts. Such an event may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to hedge our risks.

•

Many of our counterparties are financial institutions, and capital market turmoil may result in an increase in the risk of non-performance by financial
institutions. Non-performance by our counterparties may force us to unwind the hedge. We may be unable to replace the hedge, thereby leaving the risk unhedged.

•

Under the terms of our hedging contracts, we are required to post collateral and to maintain a certain level of collateral. This may adversely affect
our liquidity and could subject us to the credit risk of the counterparty to the extent it holds such collateral.

•

An increase in interest rates may result in losses at the time hedges are terminated, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

•

Changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute effective hedges due to the increased economic cost of hedges.

We report our fixed maturity securities and certain other financial instruments at market value. Valuations may include
inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, particularly during periods of market disruption, resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly
changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported in our financial statements, and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We evaluate our investment portfolio for impairments.
There can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken. Additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. Any event reducing the value of
our securities other than on a temporary basis may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

While we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business, we may in certain circumstances need to sell
investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements, changes in tax laws, rating agency decisions, and/or unexpected changes in liquidity needs. Events such as these may force us to sell securities in an unfavorable interest rate or
credit environment, with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

See “Critical
Accounting Estimates” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our investments and derivatives.

Competition may adversely
affect our market share or profitability.

All of our businesses are highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors
affecting our business are integrated product choices, price, quality of customer service and claims management, financial strength, and claims-paying ratings. We compete for new product sales, the retention of existing business, and the ability to
attract and retain independent agents and brokers to market our products, all of which affect our profitability. The level and intensity of competition may grow due to existing competitors becoming more aggressive, new competitors entering the
market, and an increase in merger and acquisition activity which may result



Index to Financial Statements

in larger competitors with greater financial resources. There are many insurance companies which actively compete with us in our lines of business, and there is no assurance that we will be able
to compete effectively against these companies and new competitors in the future. See “Competition” contained herein in Item 1 for further discussion.

Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the U.K. Accounting Standards Board (ASB), or other
standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of
generally accepted accounting principles in both the United States and the United Kingdom, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative
bodies, including the FASB and ASB. The FASB has several ongoing projects regarding accounting standards that will likely be adopted in the near future. It is expected that the United Kingdom will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) issued by the IASB in the near future. It is possible that the United States may also adopt IFRS. Future accounting standards we adopt will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our financial statements. Such
changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition.

A decrease in our financial strength or
issuer credit ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, or financial condition.

We compete
based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies. A downgrade of our financial strength ratings may adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect relationships with distributors of our
products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group or a negative outlook
statement by a rating agency could have an effect on our ability to raise capital and on our cost of capital. See “Ratings” contained herein in Item 1 and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.

Events that damage our reputation may adversely affect
our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

There are many events which may harm our reputation. These events could
include but are not limited to those discussed herein in Item 1A regarding regulatory investigations concerning one or more aspects of broker compensation and related matters, as well as legal proceedings which have previously and may in the
future result in court rulings and jury verdicts against us. Our reliance on independent contractors and brokers to distribute many of our products exposes our reputation to the possibility of being damaged by sales practices over which we have no
means of direct control. Depending on the severity of the damage to our reputation, we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business. Damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital
or increase our cost of capital. See “Regulation” contained herein in Item 1 and Note 13 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on regulatory matters
and legal proceedings.

Volatility in long-term interest rates or the rate of return on pension plan assets may have a negative effect on
the funded status of our pension plans and/or increase our pension costs.

The rate of return on pension plan assets is determined based
on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and end of the measurement period. Declines in long-term interest rates or the fair value of our plan assets may result in a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans and/or increased
pension costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Conversely, a rise in interest rates could unfavorably impact the fair value of both the fixed income and equity investments in our pension
plans. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 and Note 8 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Our insurance products may be affected by many factors, and changes in any of those factors may
materially affect our profitability.

Disability insurance may be affected by a number of social, economic, governmental, competitive, and
other factors. Changes in societal attitudes, such as work ethic, motivation, or stability, can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products. Competition in disability insurance has also been markedly
affected by the growth of social security, workers’ compensation, and other governmental programs in the workplace.

Both economic and
societal factors can affect claim incidence for disability insurance. Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence. Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may
also be influenced by the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses. The relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the
insuring organization to price, underwrite, and adjudicate the claims. Within the group disability market, pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates. However, these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk
that the market will not sustain increased prices. In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time.

The pricing actions available in the individual disability market differ between product classes. Our individual noncancelable disability policies, in which the policy is guaranteed to be renewable
through the life of the policy at a fixed premium, do not permit us to adjust premiums on our in-force business due to changes resulting from economic, societal, or other factors. Guaranteed renewable contracts that are not noncancelable can be
re-priced to reflect adverse experience, but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as in the group disability market.

Long-term care
insurance can be affected by a number of demographic, medical, economic, governmental, competitive, and other factors. Because long-term care insurance is a relatively new product for the insurance industry and is long-duration in nature, there is
not as much historical data as is available for our other products. This creates a level of uncertainty in properly pricing the product and using appropriate assumptions when establishing reserves. Long-term care insurance is guaranteed renewable
and can be re-priced to reflect adverse experience, but the re-pricing is subject to regulatory approval which can affect the length of time in which the re-pricing can be implemented, if at all. We monitor our own experience and industry studies
concerning morbidity, mortality, and policyholder terminations to understand emerging trends. Changes in actual experience relative to our expectations may adversely affect our profitability and reserves. Mortality continues to improve for
the general population, and life expectancy has increased, which could lengthen the time a claimant receives long-term disability and long-term care benefits. Due to the long duration of the product, we may be unable to purchase appropriate assets
with cash flows and durations such that the timing and/or amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities. Sustained periods of low interest rates could result in lower than expected profitability or increases in
reserves. In 2010, legislation related to healthcare reform was signed into law. Among other things, the new legislation includes the Community Living Assistance Services and Support Act (CLASS Act) which creates a nationwide voluntary
long-term services insurance program. Details of the insurance program are still emerging, but the program is scheduled to begin taking effect in 2011, with enrollment expected to begin after benefits are set in late 2012. While we continue to
monitor the impact of the CLASS Act on our company and the insurance industry as further details of the government program become available, it is possible that the program provided under the provisions of the CLASS Act may adversely affect the
demand for and profitability of our long-term care products.

Group life insurance may be affected by the characteristics of the employees
insured, the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily, our risk selection process, our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics, the geographical concentration of employees, and mortality rates. Claim
incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters, which may also affect the availability of reinsurance coverage. There are a series of lawsuits pending in federal courts challenging
the use of retained asset accounts in group life plans that are governed by ERISA. If these challenges are upheld by the courts, our ability to use such accounts for the beneficiaries of these plans may be adversely affected.



Index to Financial Statements

Voluntary products sold in the workplace may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured,
the level of employee participation and the amount of insurance the employees elect, our risk selection process, and our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics. Our voluntary life insurance products generally
include interest-sensitive forms of insurance which contain a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate. It is possible that our investment returns could be lower than the guaranteed crediting rate. The non-life contracts are guaranteed
renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience, but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as for group disability and group life products.

An assessment by a governing tax authority may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. The amount of income taxes we
pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability. Such an assessment may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We may be required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax asset.

Factors in our ability to realize a tax benefit from our deferred income tax asset include the performance of our businesses and our ability to generate
realized investment gains. If we determine that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset will not result in a future tax benefit, a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income or other comprehensive
income. Such charges may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The likelihood of recording such a valuation increases during periods of economic downturn.

Our overall risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.

We have devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management program, which has the objective of managing our
strategic, market, credit, insurance, operations, capital and liquidity, and reputational risks. However, our program may not be comprehensive, and our methods for managing risk may not fully predict future exposures. See “Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” contained herein in Item 7A for further information about our risk management program.

Litigation is common in our businesses and may result in significant financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.

Unum Group and/or its subsidiaries’ directors and officers have been sued in several lawsuits. The outcome of these lawsuits is
uncertain. An estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An adverse outcome in one or more of these actions may, depending on the nature, scope
and amount of the ruling, adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, encourage other litigation, and limit our ability to write new business, particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact certain of our ratings.

Unum Group and its insurance subsidiaries, as part of their normal operations in managing claims, are engaged in claim litigation where
disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits. Typically those lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder, and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad
faith in the handling of insurance claims. For our general claim litigation, we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course. We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to general
claim litigation, after consideration of the reserves maintained, will not be material to our financial condition. Nevertheless, given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation
involving punitive damages may, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible punitive losses.

Refer to Note 13 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in
Item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.

United Kingdom currency translation risk could materially impact reported
operating results.

The functional currency of our U.K. operations is the British pound sterling. Fluctuations in the pound to dollar
exchange rate have an effect on our financial results. In periods when the pound weakens, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the pound strengthens, translating pounds into
dollars increases current period results in relation to the prior period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds
into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K.

We are subject to various operational risks resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or from external events which may damage our market position and reputation and/or adversely affect
our results of operations or financial condition.

We face challenges and risks associated with the development, sale, and retention of
product offerings that meet the needs of our targeted markets; maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline; continued effective claim management and customer service performance; ongoing expense management; delivering effective
technology solutions; continued execution of our capital management strategy; and the successful implementation of operational improvements and strategic growth initiatives. Failure to successfully manage our operational risks may adversely affect
our competitiveness, profitability, or financial condition.

Our ability to finance our ongoing operations may not always be possible
solely from internal sources of capital and liquidity. If we need to seek external capital, there is the risk that adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital or our cost of capital.

A change in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact
our cash flows from operations. Deterioration in the credit market, which could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner, could also negatively impact our cash flows. Without sufficient
liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, and our business may suffer. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms, or at
all, which may adversely affect us.

In the near term, we expect that our need for external financing is small, but changes in our business
could increase our need. If our financial results are unfavorable, we may need to increase our capital in order to maintain our credit ratings or satisfy regulatory requirements. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by
state insurance regulations, is considered important by state insurance regulatory authorities and the rating agencies that rate insurers’ claims-paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus
could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, action by state regulatory authorities, or a downgrade by the rating agencies. Regulatory changes such as those discussed herein in Item 1A may impose higher capital requirements on our insurance
subsidiaries. Need for additional capital may limit a subsidiary’s ability to distribute funds to the holding company and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and meet our debt and other payment obligations.

Obtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be complicated in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic
uncertainty. The markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of
credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects. Similarly, our
access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through
increased dilution of their common stock holding in Unum Group.



Index to Financial Statements

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.

Our subsidiaries may be
restricted from paying dividends to our holding companies.

Unum Group and certain of its subsidiaries rely on dividends from our
insurance and non-insurance company subsidiaries to make dividend payments on our common stock, meet debt payment obligations, and pay our other obligations. Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of
dividends and on other transfers of funds to affiliates. The level of statutory earnings and capital in our insurance subsidiaries could impact their ability to pay dividends or to make other transfers of funds to our holding companies, which could
impair our ability to pay our dividends or meet our debt and other payment obligations. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” contained herein in Item 7 and Note 14 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for a discussion of the existing regulatory limitations on dividends.

Reinsurance may not be available or affordable, or reinsurers may be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our reinsurance contracts,
which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase
reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various businesses. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss
and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our results of operations. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient
reinsurance on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue. The collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a
function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. The insolvency of a reinsurer or the
inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We have intangible assets such as deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and goodwill. We may be required to accelerate amortization or recognize an impairment, which may
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

We defer certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and expense
these costs over the life of the related policies. These costs include certain commissions, other agency compensation, selection and policy issue expenses, and field expenses. VOBA represents the present value of future profits recorded in
connection with the acquisition of a block of insurance policies. DAC and VOBA are amortized based primarily upon expected future premium income of the related insurance policies. Recoverability testing for DAC and VOBA is performed on an annual
basis. Insurance contracts are grouped on a basis consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring profitability of the contracts. If recoverability testing indicates that either DAC and/or VOBA are not recoverable, the deficiency
is charged to expense. Accounting standard updates which we will be required to adopt in our first quarter 2012 filing will result in a decrease to our existing DAC asset if we choose retrospective application on adoption. See “Critical
Accounting Estimates” included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein in Item 7 and Note 1 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
contained herein in Item 8.

Goodwill is not amortized, but on an annual basis we review the carrying amount of goodwill for indications
of impairment, considering in that review the financial performance and other relevant factors. In accordance with accounting guidance, we test for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below. In addition, certain events
including, but not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment, an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency, or unanticipated competition would cause us to review goodwill for impairment more
frequently than annually.

Extreme events, including political instability or terrorism, can affect the economy in general, our
industry, and us specifically.

Events such as epidemics, pandemics, political instability, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or other
extreme events may materially adversely affect our business, the level of claims, or our results of operations, and in the event of extreme circumstances, our financial condition or viability. Beyond obtaining insurance coverage for our facilities,
there are few, if any, commercial options through which to transfer the exposure from extreme events away from us. The continued threat of terrorism could result in increased reinsurance prices and reduced insurance coverage and potentially cause us
to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. In the event of nuclear or bioterrorism attacks, epidemics, or other extreme events, we could face significant costs depending on the
government’s actions and the responsiveness of public agencies and other insurers. In addition, we may also be adversely affected if we do not maintain adequate procedures to ensure disaster recovery and business continuity for our facilities
and operations in the event of such occurrences.

We also face other risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations,
or financial condition, including but not limited to:

•

A significant deficiency in our internal controls over financial reporting;

•

Any requirement to restate financial results due to inappropriate application of accounting principles;

•

Risks associated with security or interruption of information systems, which could cause, among other things, operational disruption and reputational
harm;

•

A guaranty fund assessment by a governing regulatory body to cover the proportional cost of an insolvent or failed insurer;

•

Failure to adequately plan for succession of our senior management and other key executives; and

•

Failure of our processes to prevent and detect fraud and/or unethical conduct of employees.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included below the Table of Contents, “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A, “Selected Financial Data” included in Item 6, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and
notes thereto included in Item 8.

Executive Summary

During 2010, our focus remained on disciplined top-line growth and capital management. Objectives for the year included:

•

Consistently execute our operating plans with an emphasis on disciplined, profitable growth.

•

Further enhance financial flexibility through solid operating and investment performance, as well as a disciplined approach to capital management.

•

Continue to invest in our business, including our products and services, as well as in the professional development of our employees.

•

Remain positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in the marketplace.

A discussion of our operating performance and capital management follows.

2010 Operating Performance and Capital Management

For 2010 we reported net income
per share, assuming dilution, of $2.71 compared to $2.57 in 2009. After-tax operating income was $2.69 per share compared to $2.57 per share in 2009. Our operating revenue by segment increased 0.9 percent over 2009, with the current economic
environment continuing to negatively impact our premium growth. Operating income by segment increased 2.0 percent over 2009, with solid performance in many of our product lines. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” contained
herein in Item 7.

Our Unum US segment reported an increase in segment operating income of 6.6 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, with the
overall risk experience across our product lines remaining generally stable. The benefit ratio for the Unum US segment for 2010 was 79.3 percent compared to 79.1 percent in 2009, with year over year improvement in benefit ratios for group disability
and voluntary benefits slightly offset by the higher benefit ratio in the individual disability – recently issued and long-term care product lines. Unum US premium income decreased slightly in 2010 compared to 2009. Similar to 2009, the ongoing
high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment continued to pressure our sales and premium income growth. In particular, premium growth from existing customers continued to be unfavorably impacted by lower salary growth and lower growth
in the number of employees covered under an existing policy. Partially offsetting this unfavorable impact on premium growth was higher persistency. Unum US sales, which were also negatively impacted by the economy and the competitive environment,
decreased 5.7 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Our group core market segment, which we define for Unum US as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 lives, reported a sales decline of 8.3 percent in 2010 relative to 2009. Sales in the group large
case market segment in 2010 declined 19.8 percent compared to 2009. Sales of voluntary benefits increased 15.6 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Persistency for all product lines remains high relative to historical levels.

Our Unum UK segment reported a decrease in segment operating income of 15.8 percent in 2010, as measured in Unum UK’s local currency, relative to
last year. The decrease was driven by a decline in premium income as well as less favorable risk results. The decline in premium income resulted from lower premium growth from existing customers and pricing actions due to the competitive U.K.
market. The benefit ratio for Unum UK was 67.0 percent in 2010 compared to 54.5 percent in 2009, driven primarily by lower premium income, the impact of higher inflation on claim reserves associated with group long-term disability policies
containing an inflation-linked benefit increase feature, and unfavorable claim experience in group life. Overall sales in Unum UK were generally consistent with the prior year, with a decline of 0.9 percent in 2010, as measured in Unum UK’s
local currency. Negatively affecting year over year comparisons is an increase in 2009 sales which resulted from the exit of another large insurance provider from the U.K. group risk market. Persistency generally improved over the levels of last
year.



Index to Financial Statements

Our Colonial Life segment reported a slight increase in segment operating income of 0.5 percent in 2010
relative to 2009, with premium growth of 6.0 percent relative to last year. Risk results were less favorable than last year, with a benefit ratio of 49.7 percent in 2010 compared to 47.3 percent in 2009, driven primarily by unfavorable experience in
the accident, sickness, and disability product line. Colonial Life’s sales increased 4.4 percent relative to 2009. The number of new accounts and new agent contracts both increased relative to the prior year, while the average new case size
declined. Persistency continues to remain strong and is slightly higher than the levels of 2009.

Our investment portfolio continued to perform
well, with an increase in net investment income of 6.3 percent over 2009. The net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was $3.5 billion at the end of 2010, compared to a gain of $2.0 billion at year end 2009.

We believe our capital and financial positions are strong. At the end of 2010, the risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance
subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was approximately 398 percent, compared to 382 percent at the end of 2009. Our leverage ratio, when calculated using consolidated debt to total
consolidated capital, was 25.9 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to 24.8 percent at December 31, 2009, reflecting the issuance of $400.0 million of senior notes during the third quarter of 2010. Our leverage ratio, when calculated
excluding the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind Holdings) and Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings), was 22.8 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to 20.5 percent at the end of 2009. The cash
and marketable securities at our holding companies equaled approximately $1.2 billion at the end 2010, compared to $915 million at the end of 2009. During 2010, we repurchased 16.4 million shares of Unum Group’s common stock under our
$500.0 million share repurchase program, at a cost of approximately $356.0 million. In February 2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Unum Group’s common stock over the next 18 months, in addition to
the amount remaining to be repurchased under the $500.0 million program.

Despite the difficult economic environment, we continue to make
steady and disciplined progress, executing on our business plans and strengthening our financial position. We remain cautious of the near-term outlook for employment levels and wages, both of which limit opportunities for premium growth, but we
believe we are poised to profitably grow as employment trends improve.

Further discussion is included in “Segment Results,”
“Investments,” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” contained in this Item 7.

Outlook for

During 2011, our focus will remain on disciplined top-line growth and capital management. Objectives for the year include:

•

Continue to consistently execute against our operating plans, which emphasize disciplined, profitable growth;

•

Further enhance our financial flexibility through solid operating and investment performance and a sustainable capital deployment strategy;

•

Leverage our capabilities, products, relationships, and reputation to deliver on our commitments as well as our bottom-line targets;

•

Continue to invest in our businesses and leverage global capabilities to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities.

Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in
our financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting estimates we deem to be most critical to our results of operations and balance sheets are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits, deferred acquisition costs,
valuation of investments, pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, and contingent liabilities. Estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and
disclosed in our financial statements.

For additional information, refer to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8.

Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits

Our largest liabilities are reserves for claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders. The two primary
categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us. These reserves equaled $38.2 billion and $37.8 billion at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, or approximately 78.9 percent and 82.3 percent of our total liabilities, respectively. Reserves ceded to reinsurers were $6.7 billion at both December 31, 2010 and 2009, and are reported as
reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets.

Policy Reserves

Policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future
premiums, allowing a margin for expenses and profit. These reserves relate primarily to our traditional non interest-sensitive products, including our individual disability, individual and group long-term care, and voluntary benefits products in our
Unum US segment; individual disability products in our Unum UK segment; disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our Colonial Life segment; and, the Individual Disability – Closed Block segment products. The reserves are
calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate (i.e., loss recognition occurs).

•

Persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations.

•

Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted
as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations.

•

Discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns.

In establishing policy reserves, we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future
experience, which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation. We do not, however, establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions.

We perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of
the test, without a provision for adverse deviation. We group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are
higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency. Thereafter, the policy reserves for
the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing, referred to as the gross premium valuation method, wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation (loss recognition) date rather than
the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive.

Because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency, mortality and morbidity, and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time, policy
reserve assumptions are not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance. Therefore, we maintain policy reserves for a policy for as long as the policy remains in-force, even after a separate
claim reserve is established. Incidence rates in industry standard valuation tables for policy reserves have traditionally included all lives, active and disabled. In addition, the waiver of premium provision provides funding for the policy
reserve while a policyholder is disabled. As a result, the funding mechanisms and the cost of claims are aligned and require a policy reserve to be held while on claim. In addition, most policies allow for multiple occurrences of claims,
and a policy reserve is consequently still maintained at the time of claim to fund any potential future claims. The policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is
eliminated as policyholders reach the terminal age for coverage, die, or voluntarily lapse the policy.



Index to Financial Statements

Policy reserves for Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial Life products, which at December 31, 2010
represented approximately 40.0 percent, 0.2 percent, and 9.5 percent, respectively, of our total gross policy reserves, are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by GAAP. In applying this method, we use, as applicable by
product type, morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions, claim resolution rate assumptions, and policy persistency assumptions, among others, to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income. We then apply
an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive, with a provision for profit allowed.

Policy reserves for our Individual Disability – Closed Block segment, which at December 31, 2010 represented approximately 9.0 percent of our
total gross policy reserves, are determined using the gross premium valuation method based on assumptions established as of January 1, 2004, the date of loss recognition. Key assumptions are policy persistency, claim incidence, claim resolution
rates, commission rates, and maintenance expense rates. We then apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will
receive, with no provision for future profit. The interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for this segment. Under the gross premium valuation method, we do not include an
embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. We perform loss recognition tests
on the policy reserves for this block of business quarterly.

The Corporate and Other segment includes certain products no longer actively
marketed, the majority of which have been reinsured. Policy reserves for this segment represent $5.7 billion on a gross basis, or approximately 41.3 percent, of our total policy reserves. We have ceded $4.4 billion of the related policy reserves to
reinsurers. The ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable. We continue to service a block of group pension products, which we have not ceded, and the policy reserves for these products are
based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates. Expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities.

Claim Reserves

Claim
reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) to us and, as prescribed by GAAP, equals our long-term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments
and claim adjustment expenses. A claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim, such as the benefits available under the applicable policy, the covered benefit period, and the age and occupation of the claimant, as well as
assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration and discount rate. Reserves for IBNR claims, similar to incurred claim reserves, include our assumptions for
claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims, are also based on historical incidence rate assumptions, including claim reporting patterns, the average cost of claims, and the expected
volumes of incurred claims. Our incurred claim reserves and IBNR claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions.

Claim reserves, unlike policy reserves, are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change. Each quarter we review our emerging
experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate. If we believe, based on our actual experience and our view of future events, that our long-term assumptions need to be modified, we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit
to our current period income.

Multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities, with each method having its own
advantages and disadvantages. Available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method, the paid development method, the incurred loss development method, the count and severity method, and the expected
claim cost method. No single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines. The estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves.



Index to Financial Statements

Claim reserves supporting our Unum US group and individual disability and group and individual long-term
care lines of business and our Individual Disability – Closed Block segment represent approximately 39.5 percent and 43.7 percent, respectively, of our total claim reserves at December 31, 2010. We use a tabular reserve methodology for
group and individual long-term disability and group and individual long-term care claims that have been reported. Under the tabular reserve methodology, reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported
claimants, such as age, length of time disabled, and medical diagnosis. We believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long-term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim. IBNR claim
reserves for our long-term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs. For group short-term disability products, an estimate of the value of
future payments to be made on claims already submitted, as well as IBNR claims, is determined in aggregate rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for our long-term products, using historical patterns of claim incidence as well as
historical patterns of aggregate claim resolution rates. The average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long-term liabilities
and results in less estimation variability.

Claim reserves supporting the Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment products
represent approximately 3.8 percent of our total claim reserves at December 31, 2010. Claim reserves for these products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid, IBNR death claims, and a liability for waiver of premium
benefits. The death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid, the IBNR reserve is calculated using the count and severity method, and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology.

Claim reserves supporting our Unum UK segment represent approximately 9.0 percent of our total claim reserves at December 31, 2010, and
are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for Unum US disability and group life reserves. The assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard United Kingdom industry experience,
adjusted for Unum UK’s own experience.

The majority of the Colonial Life segment lines of business have short-term benefits, which
generally have less estimation variability than our long-term products because of the shorter claim payout period. Our claim reserves for Colonial Life’s lines of business, which approximate 1.3 percent of our total claim reserves at
December 31, 2010, are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience. The incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments
for each loss date. Where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate, we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure. The key assumptions for claim reserves for the Colonial Life
lines of business are: (1) the timing, rate, and amount of estimated future claim payments; and (2) the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims.

The following table displays policy reserves, incurred claim reserves, and IBNR claim reserves by major product line, with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net
of the associated reinsurance recoverable. Incurred claim reserves represent reserves determined for each incurred claim and also include estimated amounts for litigation expenses and other expenses associated with the payment of the claims as well
as provisions for claims which we estimate will be reopened for our long-term care products. IBNR claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products. The IBNR and
reopen claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis.

Key Assumptions

The calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions, but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are (1) the discount rate, (2) the claim resolution rate, and
(3) the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves. Of these assumptions, our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of
our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time.

1.

The

discount rate

, which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the interest rate that we use to discount future
claim payments to determine the present value. A higher discount rate produces a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim
payments. In this case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient. We set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions.
If the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio, it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new
investment yield.

2.

The

claim resolution rate

, used for both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the probability that a disability claim will close due to
recovery or death of the insured. It is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim. Estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the
claim benefits over time. Claim resolution assumptions involve many factors, including the cause of disability, the policyholder’s age, the type of contractual benefits provided, and the time since initially becoming disabled. We use our own
claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions. These assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability. Our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of
years, with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years. We also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience.

3.

The

incidence rate

, used for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves, is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us. The incidence rate is affected by many
factors, including the age of the insured, the insured’s occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment. We establish our incidence assumption using a
historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations.

Establishing reserve
assumptions is complex and involves many factors. Reserves, particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long-term disabilities, are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion. The
impact of internal and external events, such as changes in claims management procedures, economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, new trends and developments in medical
treatments, and legal trends and legislative changes, among other factors, will influence claim incidence and resolution rates. Reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line. Additionally, in any period and over
time, our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long-term assumptions, either singularly or collectively, and these variances may offset each other. We test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and
with a long-term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time. Therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the
assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption, but rather in the aggregate by product line. We have presented in the following section an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in
our assumptions, in aggregate, for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved
for, either favorable or unfavorable.



Index to Financial Statements

Trends in Key Assumptions

Because our actual experience regarding persistency and claim incidence has varied very little from our policy reserve and IBNR claim reserve assumptions, we have had minimal adjustments to our
persistency assumptions and claim incidence assumptions during the years 2008 through 2010. Generally, we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short-term, and to
the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time. However, we have historically experienced an increase in our group long-term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following
a recessionary period, particularly in our Unum US operations. During 2010, claim incidence rates for Unum US group long-term disability were slightly elevated. Given the current economic conditions, it is possible that our claim incidence
rates for this type of product may increase.

Throughout the period 2008 to 2010, actual new money interest rates varied with the changing
market conditions, and the assumptions we used to discount our reserves generally trended downward slightly for all segments and product lines. Reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims have been adjusted to reflect our
current and expected net investment returns. Changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long-duration investment portfolio needed to support the reserves for the majority of
our lines of business.

Both the mortality rate experience and the retirement rate experience for our block of group pension products have
remained stable and consistent with expectations.

Claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period
of time than our other reserve assumptions. These rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately. Claim resolution rates in our Unum US segment group and individual long-term disability product lines and our
Individual Disability – Closed Block segment have over the last several years exhibited some variability. Relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business, actual quarterly rates during 2009 and
2010 have varied by +3 and -4 percent in our Unum US group long-term disability line of business, between +10 and -12 percent in our Unum US individual disability – recently issued line of business, and between +5 and -3 percent in our
Individual Disability – Closed Block segment.

Claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can
be volatile over short periods of time. Throughout the period 2008 to 2010, we had generally stable to improving claims management performance, and our claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our long-term
assumptions. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably
and unfavorably.

We monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate. In our estimation,
scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions, when modeled together in aggregate, could produce a potential result, either positive or negative, in our Unum US group disability line of business that would
change our reserve balance by +/- 2.5 percent. Using our actual claim reserve balance at December 31, 2010, this variation would have resulted in an approximate change (either positive or negative) of $200 million to our claim reserves. Using
the same sensitivity analysis approach for our Individual Disability – Closed Block segment, the claim reserve balance could potentially vary by +/- 2.6 percent of our reported balance, which at December 31, 2010, would have resulted in an
approximate change (either positive or negative) of $260 million to our claim reserves. The major contributor to the variance for both the group long-term disability line of business and the Individual Disability – Closed Block segment is the
claim resolution rate. We believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions, in the aggregate, could result
in a material impact on our reserve levels, but we record our reserves based on our long-term best estimate. Because these product lines have long-term claim payout periods, there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs,
either positive or negative.

Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC)

We defer certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortize (expense) these costs over the life of the related policies. Deferred costs include
certain commissions, other agency compensation, selection and policy issue expenses, and field expenses. Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level
throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral.

Approximately 87.6 percent of our DAC relates to traditional non
interest-sensitive products, and we amortize DAC in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies. Key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of DAC are future persistency and future premium
income. We use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining the expected persistency and premium income. The estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is
generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years, which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy. During 2010,
our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization did not change materially from those used in 2009. Generally, we do not expect our persistency or interest rates to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these
trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time.

Presented below are our current assumptions regarding
the length of our amortization periods, the approximate DAC balance that remains at the end of years 3, 10, and 15 as a percentage of the cost initially deferred, and our DAC balances as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Amortization of DAC on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the
anticipated experience, and as a result, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. We may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected. Because our actual experience regarding persistency and
premium income has varied very little from our assumptions during the last three years, we have had minimal adjustments to our projected amortization of DAC during those years. We measure the recoverability of DAC annually by performing gross
premium valuations. Our testing indicates that our DAC is recoverable.



Index to Financial Statements

In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update
(ASU), now included in Accounting Standards Codification 944 “Financial Services – Insurance,” which is intended to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or
renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and permit retrospective
application. The guidance in this update will result in a decrease in the opening balance of our retained earnings if we choose retrospective application on adoption and will result in a decrease in the level of costs we defer subsequent to
adoption. Given that application guidance is still evolving, we have not yet finalized the expected impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Valuation of Investments

All of our fixed maturity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. Our derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. We hold an
immaterial amount of equity securities, which are also reported at fair value.

Definition of Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date and, therefore, represents an exit price, not an entry price. The exit price objective applies regardless of a reporting entity’s intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the
measurement date.

The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of
pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in
measuring fair value. An active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. A quoted price in an
active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using
valuation techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the
characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions.

Valuation Techniques

Valuation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types:

1.

The

market approach

uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Valuation
techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables or matrix pricing. Market multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable. The selection of where within the
range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors specific to the measurement. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities without relying
exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but comparing the securities to benchmark or comparable securities.

2.

The

income approach

converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. Income approach techniques rely
on current market expectations of future amounts. Examples of income approach valuation techniques include present value techniques, option-pricing models that incorporate present value techniques, and the multi-period excess earnings method.

3.

The

cost approach

is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset, or the current replacement cost. That
is, from the perspective of a market participant (seller), the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant (buyer) to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility.

We use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be
obtained without undue cost and effort. In some cases, a single valuation technique will be appropriate (for example, when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities). In other cases,
multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate. If we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value, we evaluate and weigh the results, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. A fair value
measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.

The selection of the valuation
method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued. For assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market
approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. We believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the type of investments we hold. Our fair value measurements could differ
significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs. When markets are less active, brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker. In weighing a broker quote as an input to fair
value, we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions. We also consider the nature of the quote, particularly whether the quote is a binding offer. If prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices
for the same or similar assets, adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value. When relevant market data is unavailable, which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty, the income approach can, in suitable circumstances, provide a
more appropriate fair value. During 2010, we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end 2009.

Inputs to Valuation Techniques

Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique
used to measure fair value (such as a pricing model) and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable.

Observable inputs

are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources.

Unobservable inputs

are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Inputs that may be used include the
following:

•

Broker market maker prices and price levels

•

Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) pricing

•

Prices obtained from external pricing services

•

Benchmark yields (Treasury and interest rate swap curves)

•

Transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades

•

Security cash flows and structures

•

Recent issuance/supply

•

Sector and issuer level spreads

•

Security credit ratings/maturity/capital structure/optionality

•

Corporate actions

•

Underlying collateral

•

Prepayment speeds/loan performance/delinquencies/weighted average life/seasoning

•

Audited financial statements

We review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a security’s price. The overall
valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price. These adjustments may be made when, in our judgment and considering our knowledge of
the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates, certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources. These features may include the complexity
of the financial instrument, the market in which the financial instrument is traded, counterparty credit risk, credit structure, concentration, or liquidity. Additionally, an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our
judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument.

The parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis, as certain features may be
more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing. Changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies; rather, the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market
conditions.

Fair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or
pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period. We analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded
within the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives’ fair values. If counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not
adequately reflected in the LIBOR-based fair value obtained from our pricing sources, we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources. In regard to our own credit risk component, we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein
the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the LIBOR-based valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk.

Fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical
value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangement.

Certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity. For these securities, we use internally
prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party
brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities. Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and
other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.

As of December 31, 2010, the key
assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below. Where appropriate, we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change.

•

Risk free interest rates of 2.01 percent for five-year maturities to 4.33 percent for 30-year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for
U.S. Treasury Bonds with similar maturities. This compares to interest rates of 2.68 percent for five-year maturities to 4.64 percent for 30-year maturities used at December 31, 2009.



Index to Financial Statements

•

Current Baa corporate bond spreads ranging from 1.31 percent to 1.95 percent plus an additional 20 basis points were added to the risk free rate to
reflect the lack of liquidity. We used spreads ranging from 1.60 percent to 2.00 percent plus an additional 20 basis points at December 31, 2009. The changes were based on observable market spreads. Newly issued private placement securities
have historically offered yield premiums of 20 basis points over comparable newly issued public securities.

•

An additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments, consistent with December 31, 2009.

•

Additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered
to be of greater risk.

Increasing the 20 basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by one basis point,
increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point, and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the
December 31, 2010 fair value of these types of securities by approximately $0.5 million. We believe this range of variability is appropriate, and historically the inputs noted have generally not deviated outside the range provided.

We regularly test the validity of the fair values determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the prices of assets sold to the fair values
reported for the assets in the immediately preceding reporting period. Historically, our realized gains or losses on dispositions of investments have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodologies described above,
which, combined with the results of our testing, indicates to us that our pricing methodologies are appropriate.

At December 31, 2010,
approximately 13.5 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from TRACE pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security (comparable to receiving one binding
quote). The prices obtained were not adjusted, and the assets were classified as Level 1, the highest category of the three-level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.

The remaining 86.5 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on non-binding quotes or
other observable or unobservable inputs, as discussed below.

•

Approximately 69.7 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such
as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques. These assets were classified as Level 2. Level 2 assets or liabilities are those valued using inputs (other than prices included in Level 1) that are
either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life.

•

Approximately 5.3 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more non-binding broker price levels, if validated by observable
market data, or on TRACE prices for identical or similar assets absent current market activity. When only one price is available, it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate. These assets, for which we were able to
validate the price using other observable market data, were classified as Level 2.

•

Approximately 11.5 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities, matrix pricing, market models, and/or
internal models or were valued based on non-binding quotes with no other observable market data. These assets were classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data. Level 3
is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3
are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.



Index to Financial Statements

We consider transactions in inactive or disorderly markets to be less representative of fair value. We use
all available observable inputs when measuring fair value, but when significant other unobservable inputs and adjustments are necessary, we classify these assets or liabilities as Level 3.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 13.5 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as Level 1, 83.9 percent as Level 2, and 2.6 percent as Level 3. During 2010, we transferred
$565.1 million of fixed maturity securities into Level 3 and $503.8 million of fixed maturity securities out of Level 3. The transfers between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of
the securities transferred: (1) transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades, (2) broker/dealer quotes and pricing, primarily related to changes in the level of activity in the market and whether the market was considered
orderly, and (3) comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis. For fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of Level 3, we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning
of the period. We believe this allows for greater transparency as all changes in fair value that arise during the reporting period of the transfer are disclosed as a component of our Level 3 reconciliation as shown in Note 2 of the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8.

Other-than-Temporary Impairment Analysis for
Investments

In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, we
evaluate the following factors:

•

Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.

•

Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis.

•

Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments.

•

The significance of the decline in value.

•

The time period during which there has been a significant decline in value.

•

Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings.

•

The valuation of the security’s underlying collateral.

•

Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles.

•

Market conditions.

•

Rating agency and governmental actions.

•

Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity.

•

Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments.

•

Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.

•

Any other key measures for the related security.

We evaluate available information, including the factors noted above, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we also consider the strength of the issuer’s balance
sheet, its debt obligations and near term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and
regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the
security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether
impairments are other than temporary. The significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on
these two factors, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.

While determining other-than-temporary
impairments is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The
process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other-than-temporary impairment.



Index to Financial Statements

If we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary, the investment is
written down to fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period, either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income, as applicable. For those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss for which we
have not recognized an other-than-temporary impairment, we believe we will recover the entire amortized cost, we do not intend to sell the security, and we do not believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before
recovery of its amortized cost. There have been no defaults in the repayment obligations of any securities for which we have not recorded an other-than-temporary impairment.

Other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal
the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. For securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value,
other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the
effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. The determination of cash flows is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on the circumstances specific to the security. The timing and amount of
our cash flow estimates are developed using historical and forecast financial information from the issuer, including its current and projected liquidity position. We also consider industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, future
business prospects and earnings trends, issuer refinancing capabilities, actual and/or potential asset sales by the issuer, and other data relevant to the collectibility of the contractual cash flows of the security. We take into account the
probability of default, expected recoveries, third party guarantees, quality of collateral, and where our debt security ranks in terms of subordination. We may use the estimated fair value of collateral as a proxy for the present value of cash
flows if we believe the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of our investment. For fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings, if through
subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income.

We use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection
and reevaluation. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We establish an
allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans, considering the value of the underlying collateral. Mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is
considered impaired, in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income.

There
are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities:

•

The assessment of a borrower’s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change.

•

The economic outlook, either domestic or foreign, may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated, and as
such, the investment may not recover in value.

•

New information may become available concerning the security, such as disclosure of accounting irregularities, fraud, or corporate governance issues.

•

Significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry.

•

Significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased.

•

Adverse rating agency actions may occur.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans. The
U.S. pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and pension expense. Our U.K. operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees. The U.K. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on
December 31, 2002.

Our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set
of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience. Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount (interest) rate and the long-term rate of return on plan
assets. We also use, as applicable, expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate, and the U.K. pension plan also
uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefits.

The assumptions chosen for our pension and OPEB plans are reviewed annually, and we
use a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans. The discount rate assumptions and expected long-term rate of return assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans. In
addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and OPEB plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to
terminated employees, or changes in benefits provided under the plans.

Discount Rate Assumptions

The

discount rate

is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value. We set the discount rate assumption at
the measurement date for each of our retirement-related benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits. A lower discount rate
increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs.

The discount rate we used to determine our 2011 and 2010 net
periodic benefit costs for our U.S. pension plans was 5.80 percent and 6.40 percent, respectively. The discount rate used for the net periodic benefit costs for 2011 and 2010 for our U.K. pension plan was 5.60 percent and 5.70 percent, respectively.
The discount rate used in the net periodic benefit cost for our OPEB plan for 2011 and 2010 was 5.60 percent and 5.90 percent, respectively.

Reducing the discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have resulted in an increase in our 2010 pension expense of approximately $12.9 million,
before tax, and an increase in our benefit obligation of approximately $139.8 million as of December 31, 2010, resulting in an after-tax decrease in stockholders’ equity of approximately $92.1 million as of December 31, 2010. A 50
basis point reduction in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual OPEB costs.

Increasing the discount rate assumption by 50
basis points would have resulted in a decrease in our 2010 pension expense of approximately $11.9 million, before tax, and a decrease in our benefit obligation of approximately $123.8 million as of December 31, 2010, resulting in an after-tax
increase in stockholders’ equity of approximately $81.6 million as of December 31, 2010. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual OPEB costs.

Long-term Rate of Return Assumptions

The

long-term rate of return

assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid. The U.S.
pension plans use a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on their pension plan assets. The investment portfolio for our U.S. pension plans contain a diversified blend of domestic and international large cap, mid cap, and small
cap equity securities, U.S. government and agency and corporate fixed income securities, private equity funds of funds, and hedge funds of funds. Assets for our U.K. pension plan are invested in pooled funds, including a diversified growth fund,
which invests in assets such as global equities, hedge funds, commodities, below-investment-grade fixed income securities, and currencies, as well as a fixed-interest U.K. corporate bond fund and an index-linked U.K.



Index to Financial Statements

government bond fund. Assets for our OPEB plan are invested primarily in life insurance contracts. We believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector, with no
potential risk concentrations in any one category.

Our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a
combination of historical market performance and evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists, and based on current market yields. For the U.S. pension plans, the methodology underlying the return assumption
included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long-term rates of return, volatility of returns, and the correlation of returns between various asset classes. The expected return for the total portfolio is
calculated based on the plan’s current asset allocation. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio
reviews. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.

The long-term rate of return on assets used in the net periodic pension costs for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2011 and 2010 was
7.50 percent for both years. The long-term rate of return on asset assumption used for 2011 and 2010 for our U.K. pension plan was 6.70 percent and 6.90 percent, respectively, and for our OPEB plan, 5.75 percent for both years. The actual rate of
return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and benefit payments.

Changing the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets by +/-50 basis points would have changed our 2010 pension plan expense by approximately $5.8 million before tax, but our OPEB plan expense
would not change. A lower rate of return on plan assets increases our expense.

Benefit Obligation and Fair Value of Plan
Assets

The market-related value equals the fair value of assets, determined as of the measurement date. The expected return on assets
fully recognizes all asset gains and losses, including changes in fair value, through the measurement date.

During 2010, the fair value of
our plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan increased $291.1 million, or approximately 32.8 percent. The fair value of plan assets for our U.K. pension plan increased £13.2 million, or approximately 13.3 percent,
during 2010. Although the effect of these increases had no impact on our 2010 net periodic pension costs, the favorable rate of return on plan assets in 2010 has a favorable impact on our net periodic pension costs for 2011. We expect that our 2011
pension costs will be generally consistent with the level of our pension costs in 2010, however, given the decrease in the discount rate. We believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment.

Our pension and OPEB plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of $512.4 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of $7.6 million,
which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense. As of December 31, 2010, the unrecognized net loss for these two
items combined was approximately $504.8 million.

The unrecognized gains or losses are amortized as a component of the net benefit cost. Our
2010, 2009, and 2008, pension and OPEB expense includes $29.1 million, $40.2 million, and $10.6 million, respectively, of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain (loss) and prior service credit (cost)

.

The lower amortization in
2010 resulted primarily from the decrease in the unrecognized net actuarial loss due to the favorable rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. pension plans. The unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans, which is $513.8 million at
December 31, 2010, will be amortized over the average future working life of pension plan participants, currently estimated at 11 years for U.S. participants and 15 years for U.K. participants, to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent
corridor, as described below. The unrecognized net actuarial gain of $1.4 million for our OPEB plan will be amortized over the average future working life of OPEB plan participants, currently estimated at 8 years, to the extent the loss is outside
of a corridor established in accordance with GAAP. The corridor for the pension and OPEB plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation. At December 31, 2010, none of the
actuarial gain was outside of the corridor for the OPEB plan.



Index to Financial Statements

The fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was $1,179.6 million at
December 31, 2010, compared to $888.5 million at December 31, 2009. This increase in fair value of plan assets and the effect of the plan contributions during 2010 lowered our year end deficit funding level in the plan to $64.0 million as
of December 31, 2010, compared to a deficit of $143.3 million as of December 31, 2009.

The fair value of plan assets in our OPEB
plan was $11.9 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. These assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our OPEB plan. Our OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and
current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and dental benefits. It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of
utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan. We expect to continue to receive subsidies under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, based on current law, to partially offset
these payments. The expected subsidy included in our consolidated balance sheets is immaterial.

Our expected return on plan assets and
discount rate discussed above will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our U.S. pension and OPEB plans because we have met all minimum funding requirements set forth by ERISA. We had no regulatory contribution requirements
for 2010 and 2009; however, we elected to make voluntary contributions of $167.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. We do not anticipate making any additional contributions during 2011.

During 2006, the U.S. federal government enacted the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which requires companies to fully fund defined benefit
pension plans over a seven year period. We have evaluated this requirement and have made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future. Based on this assessment, we do not believe that the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act will
cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

The fair value of plan assets for our U.K. pension plan was £112.7 million at
December 31, 2010, compared to £99.5 million at December 31, 2009. The U.K. pension plan has a surplus of £14.8 million at December 31, 2010, compared to a deficit of £7.8 million at December 31,
2009. We contribute to the plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires that we contribute to the plan at the rate of at least 15.0 percent of total employee salaries (including employees who are not members of the defined
benefit plan), less contributions to our defined contribution plan, sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under U.K. legislation. During 2010 and 2009, we made required contributions of £3.2 million and
£3.5 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will make contributions during 2011 of approximately £3.2 million.

See
Note 8 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Income Taxes

We
record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowance relates primarily to assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and assets for our basis in
certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are not likely to be realized in the future based on our expectations using currently available evidence. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available
positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we
determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later
determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. The amount of income taxes we
pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability.

GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in income tax returns. The evaluation of a tax position is a two step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical
merits of the position. The second step is to measure a position



Index to Financial Statements

that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed
to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the
more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. If a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the
amount initially measured, the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective. We believe that tax positions have been reflected in our financial statements at appropriate amounts in conformity
with GAAP.

See Note 6 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Contingent Liabilities

On a quarterly basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending
litigation or regulatory matters depending, in part, on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period. See Note 13 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further
discussion.

Consolidated Operating Results

(in millions of dollars)

The comparability of our financial results between years is affected by the fluctuation in the British pound sterling to
dollar exchange rate. The functional currency of our U.K. operations is the British pound sterling. In periods when the pound weakens, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the
pound strengthens, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results in relation to the prior period. Our weighted average pound/dollar exchange rate was 1.543, 1.554, and 1.871 for the years ended 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
While the impact of the difference in exchange rates year over year on the comparability of our consolidated results was not material for 2010 and 2009, our operating revenue and operating income by segment would have been lower in 2008 by
approximately $183.1 million and $58.8 million, respectively, if the results for our U.K. operations had been translated at a constant exchange rate of 1.543, the rate for 2010. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and
converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or
profitability in the U.K.

Consolidated premium income for both 2010 and 2009 includes premium growth, relative to the preceding years, for
our Unum US long-term care and voluntary benefits lines of business as well as for Colonial Life. Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment experienced premium growth in 2010 relative to 2009. Our Unum US group disability line of
business experienced year over year declines in premium income during 2010 and 2009 relative to prior years due primarily to the ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment which impact sales growth and premium growth from
existing customers. In particular, premium growth from existing customers continues to be unfavorably impacted by lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy. Premium income for Unum US individual
disability – recently issued declined year over year primarily due to lower sales. Unum UK premium income, in local currency, decreased in both 2010 and 2009 relative to preceding years due primarily to lower premium growth from existing
customers, similar to Unum US, and pricing actions due to the competitive U.K. market. Premium income in the Individual Disability – Closed Block segment, which is a closed block of business, continued its expected decline.

Net investment income was higher in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to continued growth in the level of invested assets and higher bond call
premiums. We also received higher interest income during 2010 on bonds for



Index to Financial Statements

which interest income is linked to a U.K. inflation index. These index-linked bonds match the claim reserves associated with certain of our Unum UK group policies that provide for
inflation-linked increases in benefits, with the increase or decrease in investment income on these bonds generally offset by an increase or decrease in reserves. Net investment income was lower in 2009 relative to 2008 due to the weaker pound in
2009 compared to 2008, lower interest income on the inflation index-linked bonds, and lower bond call premiums and consent fees, somewhat offset by the continued growth in the level of invested assets.

We recognized in earnings a net realized investment gain of $24.7 million in 2010 compared to a gain of $11.7 million in 2009 and a loss of $465.9
million in 2008. Included in these amounts were other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities of $15.9 million in 2010, $215.5 million in 2009, and $151.1 million in 2008. Of these amounts, all were recognized in earnings other
than a loss of $3.7 million in 2009 which was recognized in other comprehensive income.

Also recognized in earnings through realized
investment gains and losses was the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement. During 2010 and 2009, changes in the fair value of this embedded derivative resulted in realized gains of $21.1 million and
$243.1 million, respectively, compared to a realized loss of $291.7 million in 2008. Gains and losses on this embedded derivative result primarily from a change in credit spreads in the overall investment market.

The benefit ratio was 85.5 percent in 2010 compared to 84.2 percent in 2009 and 85.1 percent in 2008, with generally consistent overall risk results in
Unum US but higher benefit ratios in Unum UK and Colonial Life during 2010 relative to 2009. Risk results in 2009 improved in each of our business segments compared to 2008. Further discussion of our line of business risk results and claims
management performance for each of our segments is included in “Segment Results” as follows.

Interest and debt expense for 2010 was
higher than in 2009 due to higher levels of outstanding debt, partially offset by lower rates of interest on our floating rate debt. Interest and debt expense for 2009 was lower than 2008 due primarily to lower average levels of outstanding debt and
lower rates of interest on our floating rate debt. See “Debt” contained in this Item 7 for additional information.

The
deferral of acquisition costs increased in 2010 relative to 2009, with continued growth in certain of our product lines and the associated increase in deferrable expenses more than offsetting the lower level of deferrable costs in product lines with
lower growth. The deferral of acquisition costs in 2009 was generally consistent with the level of 2008. The amortization of acquisition costs in 2010 and 2009 was slightly higher than the preceding years due to the continued increase in the level
of deferred acquisition costs as well as an acceleration of amortization resulting from lower persistency for certain issue years in the Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines. Although the 2010 rate of persistency for the overall block of
business within each of the supplemental and voluntary lines was favorable to 2009, the persistency for certain individual issue years was less than expected and required additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs.

Other expenses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a decline in our pension costs. Other expenses, as reported, decreased slightly in
2009 relative to 2008. However, if the effect of the lower exchange rate for translating Unum UK’s expenses is excluded, other expenses increased in 2009 due primarily to an increase in our pension costs in 2009 relative to 2008.

The income tax rate in the U.K. will be reduced from 28 percent to 27 percent in April 2011. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to adjust
deferred tax assets and liabilities through income on the date of enactment of a rate change, which occurred during the third quarter of 2010. Our income tax expense for 2010 includes a reduction of $2.7 million which was recorded in the third
quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the rate change on our net deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations. Our income tax rate for 2010 was also lower relative to preceding years due to tax benefits recognized as a result of our
increased level of investments in low-income housing tax credit partnerships.

In March 2010, legislation related to healthcare reform was
signed into law. Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug



Index to Financial Statements

coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012. Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize
the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted. Our income tax expense for 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million which was recorded in the first
quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change.

Consolidated Sales Results

(in millions of dollars)

Sales results shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium or annualized fee income on new sales
which we expect to receive and report as premium income or fee income during the next 12 months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported, depending on the effective date of the new sale. Sales do not correspond to
premium income or fee income reported as revenue in accordance with GAAP. This is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium or fee income over a 12 month period, while premium
income and fee income reported in our financial statements are reported on an “as earned” basis rather than an annualized basis and also include renewals and persistency of in-force policies written in prior years as well as current new
sales.

Premiums for fully insured products are reported as premium income. Fees for administrative services only (ASO) products are included
in other income. Sales, persistency of the existing block of business, and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium and fee income. Trends in new sales, as well as existing market share, also indicate the potential
for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new product offerings. Sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions.

We have experienced lower sales growth in some of our product lines during both 2010 and 2009, particularly in the expansion of sales to existing
accounts, which we believe is mostly attributable to the current economic environment. We expect this unfavorable pattern may continue in the near term if current economic conditions persist.

See “Segment Results” as follows for additional discussion of sales by segment.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment
gains and losses, which may be recurring, and the 2010 tax charge to reflect the impact of the tax law change, as previously discussed, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our
business.



Index to Financial Statements

In the following segment financial data and discussions of segment results, “operating revenue”
excludes net realized investment gains and losses. “Operating income” or “operating loss” excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax. These are considered non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial
measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in
accordance with GAAP.

The non-GAAP financial measures of “operating revenue,” “operating income” or “operating
loss,” and “after-tax operating income” differ from revenue, income (loss) before income tax, and net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the
exclusion of before-tax realized investment gains and losses and certain tax items. We measure performance excluding realized investment gains and losses and certain tax items because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of
the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses, and a long-term focus is
necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business. Realized investment gains and losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. However, income or loss
excluding realized investment gains and losses and certain tax items does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of overall profitability. We may experience realized investment losses, which will affect future earnings levels since our
underlying business is long-term in nature and we need to earn the assumed interest rates in our liabilities.

A reconciliation of operating
revenue by segment to revenue, operating income by segment to net income, and after-tax operating income to net income is as follows:

Unum US Sales

(in millions of dollars)

Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Unum US sales continued to be negatively impacted by the current economic conditions and the competitive environment, as sales declined 5.7 percent in
2010 relative to 2009. Sales in our group core market segment, which we define for Unum US as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 lives, decreased 8.3 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, with lower group long-term and short-term disability sales and
lower group life and accidental death and dismemberment sales. The number of new accounts added in our group core market segment during 2010 was 3.0 percent lower than the number of new accounts added during 2009. Sales in the group large case
market segment decreased 19.8 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, due in part to one large case sold in the second quarter of 2009. Our 2010 sales mix was approximately 71 percent core market and 29 percent large case market, in line with our targeted
market distribution mix.



Index to Financial Statements

Sales of voluntary benefits increased 15.6 percent in 2010 relative to 2009, and the number of new accounts
increased 13.3 percent. Sales in our individual disability line of business, which are primarily concentrated in the multi-life market, decreased 17.2 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Sales of group long-term care increased 15.2 percent in 2010
compared to 2009.

We continue to believe that the group core market and voluntary benefits market, which combined together are approximately
70 percent of our Unum US sales, represent significant growth opportunities. We will also seek disciplined and opportunistic growth, generally at the market growth rate, in the group large case, group long-term care, and individual disability
markets. While in the short-term we expect economic trends to continue to pressure sales growth, we believe we are well-positioned for economic recovery.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

Total
sales for Unum US increased 1.2 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Sales in our group core market segment increased 7.9 percent over 2008, with higher group short-term disability and group life core market sales partially offset by a decline in group
long-term disability core market sales. The number of new accounts in our core market segment increased 6.5 percent in 2009 relative to 2008. Sales in the group large case market segment increased 1.2 percent compared to 2008. Our sales mix was
approximately 68 percent core market and 32 percent large case market.

Sales of voluntary benefits increased by 2.1 percent, and the number
of new accounts increased by 19.5 percent compared to 2008. Sales in our individual disability line of business decreased 10.9 percent compared to 2008, and sales of group long-term care decreased 30.4 percent. We discontinued selling individual
long-term care during 2009.

Unum US Group Disability Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US group disability.

(in millions of dollars, except ratios)

Year Ended
December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Group disability premium income decreased in 2010 compared to
2009, as the ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment continued to pressure our premium income growth. In particular, premium growth from existing customers continued to be unfavorably impacted by lower salary growth and
lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy. Partially offsetting the unfavorable growth trend from existing customers was higher premium and case persistency for both group long-term and short-term disability compared
to 2009. Premium and case persistency increased in 2010 relative to 2009 for group long-term disability in both the core and large case market segments. Premium and case persistency increased in 2010 relative to 2009 for group short-term disability
in the large case market segment and was generally consistent year over year in the core market segment. Net investment income was lower in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to a decrease in the



Index to Financial Statements

level of assets supporting this line of business and a decline in the level of prepayment income on mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by an increase in bond call premiums. Other income
includes ASO fees of $57.6 million and $59.2 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The benefit ratio was lower in 2010 compared to 2009
due primarily to a higher rate of claim recoveries for group long-term disability, offset partially by an increase in claim incidence rates for both group long-term and short-term disability.

Interest and debt expense related to the debt issued by Tailwind Holdings decreased in 2010 relative to 2009 due to lower rates of interest on the floating rate debt and a decrease in the amount of
outstanding debt resulting from principal repayments.

The deferral of acquisition costs in 2010 was lower than 2009 due to lower sales. The
amortization of acquisition costs in 2010 was lower than 2009 due to a decrease in amortization related to internal replacement transactions and a declining balance in the deferred acquisition costs asset.

The other expense ratio decreased slightly in 2010 relative to 2009, despite the decline in premium income, due to our continued focus on expense
management.

During 2009, Unum America entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with RGA Americas Reinsurance Company, Ltd. under
which Unum America ceded closed blocks of group long-term disability claims in 2009 and in 2010. The reinsurance transaction does not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and is therefore recorded using the deposit method of
accounting. As such, there is no effect on reported premium income or benefits. The only impact on the income statement is the risk charge paid to the reinsurer.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

Premium
income for group disability declined in 2009 relative to 2008, a portion of which was expected and was attributable to our pricing, renewal, and risk selection strategy. Premium income for our Unum US group business, both disability and life, was
also negatively impacted by lower premium growth from existing customers due to lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy. Premium persistency increased relative to 2008 for group short-term
disability in both the core and large case segments. Premium persistency for group long-term disability increased relative to 2008 in the core market segment but decreased in the large case segment, resulting in an overall persistency decline
for group long-term disability. Case persistency declined due to a higher number of terminated cases in the smaller size case market within the core segment. These terminations did not affect premium persistency negatively to the degree they
affected case persistency due to a lower average premium per terminated case. Net investment income was consistent in 2009 relative to 2008, with an increase in the level of assets offset by lower interest rates on floating rate assets. Other income
included ASO fees of $59.2 million and $64.8 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The benefit ratio for 2009 was lower than the benefit
ratio for 2008 due primarily to a higher rate of claim recoveries for group long-term disability and a decrease in the paid claim incidence rates for group short-term disability. Paid claim incidence rates for group long-term disability were higher
in 2009 relative to 2008, but the average size of new claims was lower.

Interest and debt expense related to the debt issued by Tailwind
Holdings decreased in 2009 relative to 2008 due to lower rates of interest on the floating rate debt and a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt resulting from principal repayments.

The deferral of acquisition costs increased in 2009 relative to 2008 due to a higher level of deferrable expenses partially resulting from increased group short-term disability sales. Amortization was
lower in 2009 relative to 2008 due to a decrease in amortization related to internal replacement transactions.



Index to Financial Statements

The other expense ratio increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to the decline in premium income
and an increase in policy maintenance expenses associated with the change in the mix of in-force policies from the large case market to the core market segment. Included in 2008 other expenses was $4.4 million related to a 2008 broker compensation
settlement agreement.

Unum US Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment.

(in millions of dollars, except ratios)

Year Ended
December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Premium income for group life and accidental death and
dismemberment increased in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to favorable premium and case persistency. Premium and case persistency for the group life product line increased in both the core and large case market segments. Net investment income
was higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to an increase in the level of assets supporting this line of business.



Index to Financial Statements

The benefit ratio for 2010 was consistent with 2009. Commissions were higher due to an increase in
supplemental payments. The deferral of acquisition costs increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the increase in commission expense. The amortization of acquisition costs in 2010 was lower than 2009 due primarily to a decrease in
amortization related to internal replacement transactions.

The other expense ratio decreased in 2010 in comparison to 2009 due to our
continued focus on expense management.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

Premium income for group life and accidental death and dismemberment decreased in 2009 relative to 2008, a portion of which was expected
and was due to our pricing, renewal, and risk selection strategy. Consistent with the decline in premium income for group disability, premium growth for group life and accidental death and dismemberment was also negatively impacted by lower premium
growth from existing customers. Premium income for accidental death and dismemberment declined in part due to a reinsurance agreement entered into, effective January 1, 2009, to cede an $8.0 million annualized premium in-force block of
business. In both product lines, premium persistency improved, but case persistency declined in comparison to 2008 due to a higher number of terminated cases in the fewer than 100 lives market segment. Net investment income was consistent in 2009
relative to 2008, with an increase in the level of assets offset by lower interest rates on floating rate assets.

The benefit ratio in 2009
was higher than 2008 as a result of a higher average paid claim size in group life which was only partially offset by a lower rate of paid claim incidence.

The deferral of acquisition costs increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to an increase in the level of deferrable expenses resulting from the increase in sales. Amortization of deferred
acquisition costs was lower in 2009 relative to 2008 due to a decrease in amortization related to internal replacement transactions.

The
other expense ratio increased in 2009 in comparison to 2008 due to the decline in premium income as well as an increase in policy acquisition-related costs associated with increased sales and an increase in policy maintenance expenses associated
with the change in the mix of in-force policies from the large case market to the core market segment.

Unum US Supplemental and Voluntary Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US supplemental and voluntary product lines.

(in millions of dollars, except ratios)

Year Ended
December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Premium income in total for these product lines increased in 2010
relative to 2009 due primarily to sales growth in the voluntary benefits product line and higher persistency for all of the product lines. Premium income declined in 2010 relative to 2009 for individual disability – recently issued due to lower
sales. Net investment income increased in 2010 relative to 2009 due to growth in the level of assets supporting these lines of business, higher bond call premiums, and an increased level of prepayment income on mortgage-backed securities.



Index to Financial Statements

The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability – recently issued line of business in
2010 was consistent with 2009, with a higher rate of claim recoveries generally offsetting the higher paid claim incidence rates. The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care increased in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to an increase in
the active life reserve and increased paid claim incidence rates. The benefit ratio for voluntary benefits decreased in 2010 when compared to 2009 due primarily to a lower average paid claim size in the voluntary life product line, particularly in
the second half of 2010.

The deferral of acquisition costs in 2010 was consistent with 2009. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs
was higher in 2010 relative to 2009 due to an acceleration of amortization resulting from lower persistency for certain issue years in certain of the product lines. The other expense ratio in 2010 was consistent with the level of 2009.

The individual disability – recently issued product line had goodwill of approximately $187.5 million at December 31, 2010, none of which is
currently believed to be at risk for future impairment. The fair value of this product line is significantly in excess of its carrying value.

In late 2010, we began a process of filing requests with various state insurance departments for a rate increase on certain of our individual long-term
care policies. The rate increase reflects current interest rates, higher expected future claims, persistency, experience, and other factors related to pricing individual long-term care coverage. In states for which a rate increase is submitted
and approved, customers are also given options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs. Higher premium income associated with the rate increase is expected to emerge during 2011.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

Premium income increased in 2009 relative to 2008 due primarily to sales growth in the voluntary benefits product line, partially offset by a slight
decline in premium persistency. Net investment income increased in 2009 relative to 2008 due to higher investment income related to growth in the level of assets supporting these lines of business, an increased level of prepayment income on
mortgage-backed securities, and a higher yield on the portfolio due to the investment of new cash at higher yields than that of the existing portfolio.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability – recently issued line of business declined in 2009 relative to 2008 due primarily to a more favorable claim recovery rate and a lower
number of reopened claims, partially offset by an increase in the paid incidence rate. The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care increased in 2009 relative to 2008 due primarily to an increase in paid claim incidence rates. The benefit
ratio for voluntary benefits decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 due primarily an increase in premium income, partially offset by an increase in the paid claim incidence rate for the voluntary disability product line.

The deferral of acquisition costs decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the decrease in acquisition-related expenses resulting from lower overall
sales. The amortization of acquisition costs was higher in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to an acceleration of amortization resulting from lower persistency in certain of the product lines. The other expense ratio in 2009 was consistent with 2008.

Segment Outlook

During 2010, we continued to experience an unfavorable impact on premium and sales growth, particularly growth in existing customer accounts, which we attribute to the current economic environment.
Partially offsetting this unfavorable impact on premiums was higher than expected premium and case persistency in our group lines of business. We believe this is temporary in nature and that persistency may return to historical levels in 2011.
Opportunities for premium and sales growth are expected to re-emerge as the economy improves and employment growth resumes. We expect some volatility in net investment income to continue during 2011 as a result of fluctuations in bond calls and
other types of miscellaneous net investment income. We intend to continue to manage our expense levels relative to premium levels through operating effectiveness and performance management.

Periods of economic downturns have historically affected disability claim incidence rates and, to a lesser extent, disability claim recovery rates in certain sectors of the market. Certain risks and
uncertainties are inherent in



Index to Financial Statements

disability business. Components of claims experience, such as incidence and recovery rates, may be worse than we expect. Disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by,
among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence. Within the group disability market, pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates, but these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk that
the market will not sustain increased prices. In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time. The current economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of
claim incidence or lower levels of claim recoveries. We have previously taken steps to improve our risk profile, including reducing our exposure to volatile business segments through diversification by market size, product segment, and industry
segment. We believe our claims management organization is positioned for stable and sustainable performance levels. The level of disability claims incidence in 2010 was generally consistent with what we experienced in the second half of 2009. We are
uncertain as to whether the higher claim incidence is due to the normal volatility that occurs in our group disability business or is related to the economy. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our
business plans accordingly.

We believe our Unum US growth strategy is sound and that we will be able to leverage the capabilities, products,
and relationships and reputation we have built to deliver growth as the benefits market stabilizes. We continue to see future growth opportunity based on employee choice, defined employer funding, simple administration, and effective communication.
We intend to maintain our discipline and will continue (i) directing the majority of our investments to capture opportunities emerging in our core group and voluntary markets to grow them at above-market rates, (ii) focusing on margins in
large case group insurance, while leveraging core market, voluntary, and other shorter-term investments to grow at market rates, and (iii) seeking opportunities to improve margins and return in our supplemental lines of business.

We believe we are well-positioned strategically in our markets and that opportunities for continued disciplined growth exist in our group core market
segment and in the voluntary markets. While the current economic conditions have impacted our ability to grow premium income and will continue to do so until we return to a more normal economic environment, we expect to achieve marginal year over
year growth in our premium income during 2011. We anticipate that the 2011 benefit ratio in our group disability product line will be generally consistent with the level of 2010. We think future profit margin improvement is achievable, driven
primarily by our continued product mix shift and expense efficiencies as our claims performance gradually flattens.

income, claims, and expenses are received or paid in pounds, and we hold pound-denominated assets to support Unum UK’s pound-denominated policy reserves and liabilities. We translate Unum UK’s pound-denominated financial statement items
into dollars for our consolidated financial reporting. We translate income statement items using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate balance sheet items using the exchange rate at the end of the



Index to Financial Statements

period. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets.

Fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on Unum UK’s reported financial results and our consolidated financial results. In
periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period or periods, as occurred in 2010 and 2009 relative to 2008, translating pounds into dollars decreases current periods’ results relative to the prior period. In periods when the
pound strengthens relative to the preceding period, translating into dollars increases current periods’ results in relation to the prior periods.

Year Ended
December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Premium income decreased for 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily
to lower premium growth from existing customers and pricing actions due to the competitive U.K. market, partially offset by higher persistency.

Net investment income increased in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to an increase in the level of assets supporting this business segment as well as
an increase in inflation which increased the return on bonds for which interest income is linked to a U.K. inflation index. These index-linked bonds match the claim reserves associated with certain of our group policies that provide for
inflation-linked increases in benefits. The increase in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds was generally offset by an increase in the reserves for future claims payments related to the inflation index-linked group
policies.

The benefit ratio increased in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to unfavorable risk results for the group long-term disability
product line, which was driven primarily by lower premium income and the impact of higher inflation on claim reserves associated with disability policies containing an inflation-linked benefit increase feature, as discussed above, as well as a lower
level of claim resolutions. The level of disability claim incidence improved over the level of 2009. Risk results for the group life line of business were also unfavorable in 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in claim size for the
dependent life line of business.



Index to Financial Statements

The deferral of acquisition costs in 2010 decreased slightly when compared to 2009 due primarily to a lower
level of deferrable expenses resulting from lower levels of supplemental and voluntary sales. The decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs relative to 2009 is due primarily to a decrease in amortization related to internal replacement
transactions.

The other expense ratio in 2010 remained consistent when compared to 2009 due to a continued focus on expense management.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

Premium income declined in 2009 relative to 2008 due to lower premium growth from existing customers and also due to a decline in the in-force block of
group long-term disability business resulting from lower persistency and lower sales during 2008 and 2007. Also contributing to the comparative decline was an increase in group long-term disability premium income of £2.8 million in 2008
relating to a non-recurring reinsurance premium on a previously acquired claims block. The decline in group long-term disability premium income was partially offset by increases in premium income for group life and supplemental and voluntary due to
higher sales and improved persistency.

Net investment income decreased in 2009 relative to 2008 due primarily to a reduction in inflation
which reduced the return on bonds for which interest income is linked to a U.K. inflation index. The decrease in 2009 net investment income attributable to these bonds was generally offset by a comparable decrease in reserves, as previously noted.

The lower benefit ratio in 2009 in comparison to 2008 was primarily due to a decline in the level of claim incidence for group long-term
disability as well as the impact of lower inflation on claim reserves associated with group long-term disability policies containing the inflation-linked benefit increase feature. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in claim incidence
for the group life line of business. Claim recoveries for group long-term disability were generally consistent with the level of 2008.

The
deferral of acquisition costs in 2009 decreased in comparison to 2008 due primarily to a lower level of deferrable expenses resulting from the reduction in the overall expense level as well as a change in the mix of sales. The increase in
amortization of acquisition costs in 2009 relative to 2008 was due primarily to an increase in amortization related to internal replacement transactions.

Sales

Shown below are sales results in dollars and in pounds for the Unum UK
segment.

(in millions)

Sales in Unum UK decreased slightly in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in sales in the group long-term disability line
of business was attributable to a decline in sales in the large case market, partially offset by higher sales to existing customers and higher core market sales, which we define for Unum UK as employee groups with



Index to Financial Statements

fewer than 500 lives. The decrease in sales in supplemental and voluntary is due to a decline in sales in the large case market. The sales growth in group life was attributable to higher sales in
the large case markets as well as higher sales to existing customers, partially offset by slightly lower core market sales. Negatively affecting year over year comparisons is an increase in 2009 sales which resulted from the exit of another large
insurance provider from the U.K. group risk market.

Sales in Unum UK increased in 2009 compared to 2008, aided by the exit of another large
insurance provider from the U.K. group risk market, as previously noted. Excluding the sales related to this exit of this provider, Unum UK sales increased 8.6 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The sales growth in group life was attributable to
sales growth in both the core market and in the large case market, partially offset by lower sales to existing customers. The decline in group long-term disability sales was due to a decrease in sales to existing customers, partially offset by sales
growth in both the core and large case markets. The increase in sales in supplemental and voluntary was due to sales growth in both the core and large case markets.

Segment Outlook

During 2010, we experienced an unfavorable impact on premium
growth as a result of the challenging economic and competitive pricing environment. We expect this may continue in the near term if current economic and competitive conditions in the U.K. persist. Our sales growth may also be impacted by a prolonged
competitive pricing environment in the U.K. The level of disability claim incidence in 2010 is favorable relative to 2009, but our claim resolution rate is unfavorable to 2009, due in part to the impact of the economic environment on our ability to
resolve claims. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly. Continued fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling impact our reported operating results.

Our current growth strategy focuses on generating organic growth and expanding our role as the leading provider of group disability insurance
in the U.K. Our strategy for future growth combines optimizing the performance of our existing business while developing new market opportunities. We intend to optimize performance of the existing business by (i) increasing underwriting and
pricing discipline, (ii) improving our claims management processes, and (iii) expanding our broker market capabilities and sales effectiveness. We intend to develop new market opportunities by raising awareness of the need for income
protection and by offering a suite of employee paid workplace solutions using integrated products with simpler, defined choices and flexible funding options through a streamlined and efficient platform with online capabilities matched to broker and
employer needs.

In the current competitive pricing market and economic environment, we continue to have a cautious outlook for premium growth
in 2011 and anticipate negative earnings growth relative to 2010. We anticipate returning to more normalized levels of premium growth through continued favorable persistency and price increases, as well as increased sales to existing and new
customers which we expect to occur commensurate with the timing of the U.K. economic recovery. We expect our overall benefit ratio to be generally consistent with that of 2010. We expect our profit margins to continue at a favorable level, although
slightly below the level of 2010.

Insurance Company and marketed to employees at the workplace through an agency sales force and brokers.

Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Colonial Life segment.

(in millions of dollars, except ratios)



Index to Financial Statements

Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Premium income increased in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to increased sales and favorable persistency. Although the premium growth
rate improved over the rate of 2009, it is still less than our long-term expectations. Premium growth was negatively impacted during both 2010 and 2009 due to economic conditions which we believe affected the buying patterns of employees and caused
employers to defer introduction of new plans. Net investment income increased in 2010 in comparison to 2009 due to growth in the level of assets, an increase in income from partnership investments, and an increase in bond call premiums.

The overall benefit ratio increased in 2010 relative to 2009 due to unfavorable experience in the accident, sickness, and disability product line
resulting from an increase in the level of paid claims and reserves driven by a higher level of claim incidence and slightly higher average claim sizes. The cancer and critical illness benefit ratio increased relative to 2009 due primarily to the
continued higher levels of large claims on the older block of cancer products, partially offset by a refinement of the loss adjustment expense reserve calculation. Somewhat negatively affecting year over year comparisons is the release of active
life reserves in the second quarter of 2009 in our cancer and critical illness product line. The life benefit ratio decreased in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to favorable mortality.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs both increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to increased sales. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 was higher relative to
2009 due to the continued increase in the level of deferred acquisition costs, offset partially by the decrease in amortization related to certain of our interest-sensitive policies.

The other expense ratio decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to a continued focus on expense management.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

The
lower level of premium growth in 2009 compared to the 2008 growth rate was attributable primarily to lower sales during the first half of 2009 and lower persistency in the accident, sickness, and disability product line. The lower persistency
primarily relates to the loss of a few large policyholder accounts. As mentioned in the preceding discussion, we believe our lower premium growth was partially due to economic conditions. Net investment income increased in 2009 in comparison to 2008
due to growth in the level of assets, an increased level of prepayment income on mortgage-backed securities, and a higher yield on the portfolio due to the investment of new cash at a higher yield than that of the existing portfolio.

The overall benefit ratio for this segment remained stable in 2009 relative to 2008, with a lower benefit ratio in the life and cancer and critical
illness lines of business partially offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the accident, sickness, and disability line of business. The life product line reported a lower benefit ratio in 2009 relative to 2008 due to a change in the mix of
life business and the resulting lower change in the active life reserve. The cancer and critical illness product line reported a lower benefit ratio in 2009 relative to 2008 due primarily to a release of active life reserves, partially offset by an
increase in disabled life reserves associated with the older cancer products. The increase in the benefit ratio in the accident, sickness and disability line of business resulted primarily from a slight increase in the claim incidence rates relative
to the favorable experience of 2008.

The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2009 relative to 2008 due to the continued
increase in the level of deferred acquisition costs as well as the fluctuation in amortization related to certain of our interest-sensitive policies.

The other expense ratio was consistent year over year.

Sales

(in millions of dollars)

Colonial Life’s sales in 2010 increased 4.4 percent relative to 2009. New account sales increased 4.2 percent, and
existing account sales increased 4.4 percent in 2010 relative to 2009. Sales increased 8.1 percent in 2010 in the commercial market, driven primarily by sales growth of 9.3 percent in the core market segment, which we define as accounts with fewer
than 1,000 lives. In the public sector market, sales declined 8.1 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. The number of new accounts in 2010 increased 13.6 percent relative to 2009, while the average new case size declined 8.2 percent.

Colonial Life’s sales in 2009 increased 1.1 percent relative to 2008, with 7.2 percent growth in new account sales and a decline of 2.3 percent in
existing account sales. We experienced 2009 sales growth of 11.8 percent relative to 2008 in the public sector market and a slight increase in sales in commercial large case market segment. These sales increases were partially offset by a sales
decline of 2.6 percent in the commercial core market segment. The number of new accounts increased 13.3 percent in 2009 relative to 2008, while the average new case size declined 5.4 percent.

Segment Outlook

Our premium growth in 2010 improved from the level of growth in 2009, driven by modest 2010 sales growth and improved persistency. Persistency in 2009
was negatively impacted by the loss of a few large policyholder accounts. While we are encouraged by our 2010 sales results, slower sales and premium growth levels may continue in the near term if the current economic conditions persist and continue
to affect employment growth, the buying patterns of employees, and the deferral by employers of the introduction of new employee benefit plans. Periods of economic downturns have historically had minimal impact on the risk results of Colonial Life,
due primarily to a diversified product portfolio that is designed with short duration, indemnity benefits. During 2010, we experienced an increase in claim incidence levels in the accident, sickness, and disability line. However, there was not
a concentration in any particular market sector. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly.

We believe we have a stable business model, with service levels and customer retention that allowed us to focus on and deliver premium growth during 2010 despite the recent marketplace changes and
uncertainties. We believe we are well positioned for growth and that significant opportunities exist to accelerate growth during the next several years by (i) focusing on target market segments, (ii) driving new sales in the public sector market,
(iii) growing the reach and effectiveness of our distribution, and (iv) revisiting existing accounts to avoid lapses and to generate ongoing sales.

During 2011, we expect premium growth to be modest relative to our long-term outlook. We believe that strong profit margins will continue, although we expect our overall benefit ratio to be slightly
higher than the favorable risk experience of 2009 and the first half of 2010. We believe premium growth will reaccelerate as the economy improves and employment growth resumes.

Individual Disability - Closed Block Segment

The Individual Disability – Closed Block segment generally consists of those individual disability policies in-force before the substantial changes
in product offerings, pricing, distribution, and underwriting, which generally occurred during the period 1994 through 1998. A small amount of new business continued to be sold after these changes, but we stopped selling new policies in this segment
at the beginning of 2004 other than update features contractually allowable on existing policies.

Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Individual Disability – Closed Block segment.

(in millions of dollars, except ratios)

Year Ended
December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

The decrease in premium income for 2010 relative to 2009 is due to
the expected run-off of this block of closed business driven by expected policy terminations and maturities. Net investment income for 2010 was slightly higher than 2009, with higher bond call premiums mostly offset by a lower level of assets
supporting this closed block of business.

Other income, which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business and the
net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured, decreased in 2010 relative to 2009 due to less favorable investment results from the portfolios held by the ceding companies as well as less
favorable risk results from the reinsured business.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for 2010 increased relative to 2009 due to lower claim
recoveries and lower claim settlements, partially offset by lower claim incidence rates. Interest and debt expense in 2010 declined when



Index to Financial Statements

compared to 2009 due to lower rates of interest on our floating rate debt issued by Northwind Holdings and a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt resulting from principal repayments.

The other expense ratio decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to lower claims management and claim litigation costs relative to
the declining level of premium income.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

Premium income declined in 2009 relative to 2008 as expected for the run-off of this block of closed business. Net investment income
decreased in 2009 relative to 2008 due to lower interest rates on floating rate assets as well as a lower level of assets supporting this closed block of business, partially offset by an increased level of prepayment income on mortgage-backed
securities. We also received fewer bond call premiums and consent fees during 2009 compared to 2008.

Other income increased slightly in 2009
compared to 2008 due to favorable experience in the reinsured blocks.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for 2009 declined slightly relative to
2008 due to higher claim recoveries. Interest and debt expense decreased in 2009 relative to 2008 due to lower rates of interest on our floating rate debt issued by Northwind Holdings and a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt resulting from
principal repayments.

The other expense ratio increased slightly in 2009 when compared to 2008 due primarily to the decline in premium
income. Included in 2008 other expenses is a $4.7 million litigation settlement.

Segment Outlook

We expect that this segment may experience volatility in net investment income due to the variability in interest rates on floating rate assets and also
due to volatility of bond call premiums relative to historical levels. A portion of the volatility in interest income will be offset by commensurate changes in the interest expense on our floating rate debt.

We expect that operating revenue and income will continue to decline over time as this closed block of business winds down. We believe that the interest
adjusted loss ratio for this block of business will be relatively flat over the long term, but the segment may experience quarterly volatility. Claim resolution rates, which measure the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and
benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the
block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period. It is possible that variability in our reserve assumptions could result in a material impact on our reserve levels.

Corporate and Other Segment

The Corporate and Other segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and
certain other corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business. Corporate and Other also includes results from certain Unum US insurance products not actively marketed, including individual life and corporate-owned life insurance,
reinsurance pools and management operations, group pension, health insurance, and individual annuities. We expect operating revenue and income resulting from these insurance products to decline over time as these business lines wind down.

Operating Results

(in millions of dollars)

N.M. = not a meaningful percentage

Non-Insurance Product Results

Operating revenue was $97.9 million in 2010 compared
to $71.1 million and $106.0 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating losses were $71.1 million in 2010 compared to $91.9 million and $30.6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The increase in operating revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to higher net investment income resulting from higher asset levels and a higher
proportion of assets invested at long-term interest rates, partially offset by lower interest rates on short-term investments. The decrease in operating revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 is due primarily to a decrease in net investment income
resulting from lower interest rates on short-term investments. Operating revenue in 2008 included $7.6 million of other income received during 2008 related to a refund of interest primarily attributable to tax years 1986 through 1996.

Interest and debt expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the September 2010 issuance of $400.0 million of 5.625% senior notes and
the September 2009 issuance of $350.0 million of 7.125% senior notes. The higher interest and debt expense associated with the two new debt issuances was partially offset by the repayment of $10.0 million of 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024 during
the first quarter of 2010 and the repayment of $108.2 million of 5.859% senior notes during the second quarter of 2009. Interest and debt expense declined in 2009 relative to 2008 due primarily to lower average levels of outstanding debt. See
“Debt” contained in this Item 7 for further discussion.



Index to Financial Statements

Other expenses were $40.1 million in 2010 compared to $56.2 million and $19.2 million in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The volatility in other expenses is due primarily to pension costs, which increased approximately $42.0 million in 2009 relative to 2008 and declined approximately $15.0 million in 2010 relative to 2009.

Insurance Product Results

Operating revenue for our insurance products was $123.6 million in 2010 compared to $133.1 million and $135.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. These closed lines of business had operating income of
$16.5 million in 2010 compared to $32.7 million and $16.6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating expenses were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased litigation costs.

Segment Outlook

Our investment portfolio quality remains very strong, with low default experience during 2010. We are currently holding capital at our insurance
subsidiaries and holding companies at levels that exceed our long-term requirements. We expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through strong statutory earnings. During 2011, while we intend to maintain our disciplined
approach to risk management, we believe we are well-positioned wherein we have substantial flexibility to preserve our capital strength and at the same time explore opportunities to deploy the excess capital that is generated each period.

Interest and debt expense is expected to remain generally consistent with the level of 2010 due to $225.1 million of debt which will mature
in March 2011 and no expected issuances of new debt in 2011. We do not expect litigation costs to remain at the elevated level of 2010, and pension expenses are expected to remain generally consistent in 2011 with the level of 2010.

Investments

Overview

Our
investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector. We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods
where significant decreases in fair value occur. We believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio, including credit and interest rate management, has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our results.

We have no exposure to subprime mortgages, “Alt-A” loans, or collateralized debt obligations in our asset-backed, mortgage-backed
securities, or public bond portfolios. At December 31, 2010, we had minimal exposure to investments for which the payment of interest and principal is guaranteed under a financial guaranty insurance policy, and all such securities are rated
investment-grade absent the guaranty insurance policy. We held $378.0 million fair value ($374.3 million amortized cost) of perpetual debentures, or “hybrid” securities, that generally have no fixed maturity date. Interest on these
securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer. The interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other
perpetual debt instrument.

Below is a summary of our formal investment policy, including the overall quality and diversification objectives:

•

The majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our
portfolios.

•

The long-term nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns. A maximum of 10
percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below-investment-grade securities, 2 percent in equity type instruments, up to 35 percent in private placements, and 10 percent in commercial mortgage loans. The remaining assets can be
held in publicly traded investment-grade corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, bank loans, asset-backed securities, government and government agencies, and municipal securities.

•

We intend to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities, in the aggregate.



Index to Financial Statements

•

The weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be Baa1 or higher.

•

The maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits reviewed by the finance committee of Unum Group’s board of directors
and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and is more restrictive than the five percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments our insurance subsidiaries are
allowed to own. These internal limits are as follows:

•

The portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines.

•

Derivative instruments may be used to replicate permitted asset classes, hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, and match liability
duration and cash flows consistent with the plan reviewed by the finance committee of Unum Group’s board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries.

•

Asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us, reviewed by the finance committee of Unum Group’s board of directors, and approved by the
boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries.

•

The allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification, on a weekly basis,
by an investment subcommittee appointed by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries. These actions are also reviewed by the finance committee of Unum Group’s board of directors on a quarterly basis.

•

We review these investment policies and guidelines annually, or more frequently if deemed necessary, and recommend adjustments, as appropriate. Any
revisions are reviewed by the finance committee of Unum Group’s board of directors and must be approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries.

See “Critical Accounting Estimates” contained in this Item 7 for further discussion of our valuation of investments.

Investment Results

Net investment income was $2,495.5 million in 2010, an increase of 6.3 percent relative to 2009. Net investment income was higher in 2010 relative to 2009 due primarily to continued growth in the level of
invested assets and higher bond call premiums. We also received higher interest income during 2010 on bonds for which interest income is linked to a U.K. inflation index. These index-linked bonds match the claim reserves associated with certain of
our Unum UK group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in benefits, with the increase or decrease in investment income on these bonds generally offset by an increase or decrease in reserves. In addition, we earned lower interest
rates on our floating rate invested assets during 2010 compared to 2009, largely offset by lower interest expense on our floating rate debt.

Net investment income was $2,346.6 million in 2009, a decrease of 1.8 percent relative to 2008. The weaker pound in 2009 relative to 2008 unfavorably affected translated results for net investment income.
During 2009, we also received lower investment income on bonds for which interest income is linked to a U.K. inflation index, as compared to 2008, and we earned lower interest rates on our floating rate invested assets during 2009. We also



Index to Financial Statements

received fewer bond call premiums and consent fees during 2009 compared to 2008. Somewhat mitigating the impact of these items was the growth in the level of invested assets, an increase in the
level of prepayment income on mortgage-backed securities, and an increase in our portfolio yield due to the investment of new cash at higher rates than that of 2008.

The duration weighted book yield on the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was 6.71 percent as of December 31, 2010, and the weighted average credit rating was A3. This compares to a
yield of 6.74 percent as of December 31, 2009 and a weighted average credit rating of A3. We actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk. Duration is a measure
of the percentage change in the fair values of assets and liabilities for a given change in interest rates. Cash flows from the in-force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an
increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios. These results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from
potential changes in interest rates.

To assess the impact of a duration mismatch, we measure the potential changes in estimated fair
value based on a hypothetical change in interest rates to quantify a dollar value change. At December 31, 2010, a hypothetical one basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a $33.0 million change in the fair
value of our liabilities and an offsetting $31.8 million change in the fair value of assets supporting those liabilities. Although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling, the majority
of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive, and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk. Our determination of investment strategy relies more on long-term measures such as reserve adequacy
analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rates embedded in the reserves

Realized investment gains and losses, before tax, are as follows:

(in millions of dollars)

Realized Investment Losses $10.0 Million or Greater from Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

•

During 2010, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $10.2 million on securities issued by a Netherlands financial services
company. The company recorded significant impairment losses in its securities and real estate portfolios during 2009 and 2008 and required a significant amount of government aid. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in
an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years

Index to Financial Statements

billion against its lines of credit and completed a tender/exchange offer to improve its near term debt maturity profile. Continued signs that the company’s operations had weakened
materially in the first quarter 2009, as well as the continued weakness in the economy, led us to believe that covenant violations could occur in the near future. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss
position for a period of greater than three years.

•

During 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $32.9 million on securities issued by a U.K. financial institution. The decline
in value of the securities was primarily the result of the global credit crisis and the slowdown in the economy. In addition, this financial institution made a major acquisition during the peak of the past credit cycle. The financial institution
then had to recognize impairments on loans and other assets held by the acquired company, resulting in the need for additional capital. This capital was initially provided by shareholders and others, but as the economic environment further
deteriorated, the financial institution participated in the government guarantee of senior debt, capital injections, and an asset protection scheme. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a
period of greater than three years.

During 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $23.9 million on securities issued by a U.S. automotive parts company. Due to the
weak economy, automobile production had decreased dramatically, with the expectation of further production reductions at the time of the impairment loss. Declining earnings caused the company to be out of compliance with covenants in certain of its
debt issues. The company eventually obtained waivers on these covenants, the terms of which precluded the company from making interest payments on certain of its other debt issues. The company was unable to cure this default within the grace period
and ultimately was forced to file for bankruptcy. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years.

•

During 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $23.7 million on principal protected equity linked trust certificates
representing our investment in a trust which held forward contracts to purchase shares of a Vanguard S&P 500 index mutual fund. We recognized the other-than-temporary impairment loss because we intended to sell the security. At the time of the
impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than one year but less than two years.

•

During 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $20.1 million on securities issued by a large specialty chemical company. The
company reported fourth quarter 2008 earnings that were weaker than expected, which limited its prospects of refinancing its 2009 debt maturities. The company had been pursuing asset sales to raise cash but was unable to do so in time to avoid a
financial restructuring. During the first quarter of 2009, the company filed for bankruptcy protection. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years but less than
three years.

•

During 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $19.5 million on securities issued by a U.S. automotive parts company. The
majority of the company’s revenues were generated by sales to a single domestic automobile manufacturer. Due to the weak economy, automobile production had decreased dramatically, with the expectation of further production cuts. The U.S.
government made available a $5 billion credit facility to several automotive parts companies to help maintain automotive supplier liquidity. However, with their largest customer likely to undergo a major financial restructuring and/or
bankruptcy filing, the company faced increased challenges. In March 2009 its external auditors stated there was “substantial doubt” about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern if the automotive industry’s
financial problems were not resolved soon. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years.

•

During 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $17.5 million on securities issued by a U.K. financial institution. During 2008,
a significant decrease in funding liquidity ultimately required the U.K. government to nationalize this institution. In this process, the government provided



Index to Financial Statements

guarantees on deposits, senior debt, and loans. Since 2008, the company initiated several programs to improve its liquidity and to repay the loans to the government. In the first quarter of
2009, the company announced it had developed a plan for a legal and capital restructuring of the company, which it expected to complete in the second half of 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the company submitted its plan to the
European Commission (EC) and requested permission to begin the program under EC competition rules. The EC released various aspects of the company’s restructuring plan, which included splitting the company into multiple entities. It
appeared we would be unable to recover the entire cost basis of our securities, which are subordinate to the government’s debt as well as other creditors. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss
position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years.

•

During 2008, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $39.3 million on a principal protected equity linked note which contained an
embedded forward contract to purchase shares of a Vanguard S&P 500 index mutual fund. The note also provided principal protection through the substitution of highly rated bonds in place of the underlying S&P 500 index mutual fund, should a
specified trigger event occur. At the time of the impairment loss, the decline in the S&P 500 index had not been significant enough to trigger the substitution of the highly rated bonds, but due to the then recent steep decline in the S&P
500 index, we could no longer conclude that the value of the underlying S&P 500 index mutual fund would equate to or exceed the par value of the security at maturity. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized
loss position for a period of greater than three years.

•

During 2008, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $32.0 million on securities issued by a U.S. based automobile manufacturer and
its captive finance subsidiary. The company experienced a decline in profitability and cash flow due to the weak economic environment. Although at the time of the impairment loss the company had not yet received government bailout money, the
probability of receiving some form of government financial aid had significantly increased. Other U.S. automakers that had received bailout money were expected to request their bondholders to accept a significant reduction in principal. In order for
this company to stay competitive with other U.S. automakers, it was likely that it, too, would seek debt relief from its bondholders and that we would not recover our entire principal for these securities. At the time of the impairment loss, these
securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years.

•

During 2008, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $27.8 million on securities issued by a large investment banking firm. The
company experienced a rapid deterioration in its credit and derivatives portfolio, which made it impossible for the firm to raise additional capital or to sell assets to increase liquidity. The inability to raise capital forced the company
to file for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of 2008. The firm was rated A2 by Moody’s and A by S&P at the time of the bankruptcy filing. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss
position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years.

•

During 2008, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $21.6 million on securities issued by a large publisher of yellow page
advertising. The outlook for this industry had continued to worsen due to the secular change impacting the industry and due to weak economic conditions. The company’s third quarter 2008 earnings were down significantly as compared to prior
periods, and bad debt expense and financial leverage increased significantly. These financial results increased the likelihood that the company might violate bank covenants and seek waivers from its bondholders. Additionally, the company had hired
external consultants to advise it on potential capital restructuring alternatives. These events increased the likelihood that the company would seek to tender its bonds at a discounted value and that our bonds would not fully recover in value. At
the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than one year but less than two years.



Index to Financial Statements

•

During 2008, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $12.9 million on securities issued by a large international chemical company. The
company’s third quarter 2008 operating results were weak due to recessionary industry conditions and the negative impact of hurricane activity on its oil refinery operations. Due to these factors, the company experienced a significant decline
in its liquidity. In late December 2008, lenders denied the company’s request to obtain additional funding from its existing line of credit. As a result, the company’s liquidity was insufficient to fund required cash outflows, and the
company hired external consultants to advise it on potential capital restructuring alternatives. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than one year but less than two
years.

•

During 2008, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $12.1 million on securities issued by a large newspaper publishing company. The
outlook for this industry had continued to deteriorate due to the secular change away from newspaper advertising and weak economic conditions. The company reported poor third quarter 2008 operating results. The increase in leverage and lower cash
flows increased the likelihood that the company might violate its bank covenants. The company had attempted to sell non-core assets to reduce its debt, but it had been unable to execute a sale. As a result, it was likely that our bonds would not
fully recover in value. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years.

Realized Investment Losses $10.0 Million or Greater from Sale of Fixed Maturity Securities

•

We had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during 2010.

•

During 2009, we recognized a loss of $14.2 on the sale of securities issued by a large publisher of yellow page advertising. The company had suffered
from deterioration in print directories’ advertising as well as a significant rise in bad debt expenses due to the impact of the recession on small business customers. The company maintained significant amounts of available cash and was still
generating free cash flows despite the weakening economy. However, during the first quarter of 2009, the company announced that it had hired a financial adviser to review its capital structure alternatives regarding debt payments due in 2010. At the
time of disposition, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years.

•

During 2008, we recognized a loss of $16.2 million on the sale of securities issued by a large investment banking firm for which we had recorded an
impairment loss in 2008, as previously discussed.

•

During 2008, we recognized a loss of $10.1 million on the disposition of the principal protected equity linked note, as previously discussed. The
note’s substitution clause was triggered in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the continued decline in the S&P 500 index. At the time of the triggering event, we made the decision to take ownership in the underlying Vanguard S&P 500
index mutual fund shares rather than accept the zero coupon bonds issued by the financial services company. At the time of disposition, this note had been continuously in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than ninety days.

Embedded Derivative in a Modified Coinsurance Arrangement

We report changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement as realized investment gains and losses, as required
under the provisions of GAAP. GAAP requires us to include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us. However,
neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision, delinquency proceedings, or other direct regulatory action. Cash settlements or collateral related to
this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract, and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down.
We therefore



Index to Financial Statements

view the effect of realized gains and losses recognized for this embedded derivative as a reporting requirement that will not result in a permanent change in assets or stockholders’ equity.

The changes in fair value of this embedded derivative recognized as realized gains and losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 resulted primarily
from a change in credit spreads in the overall investment market. The fair value of this embedded derivative was $(96.3) million at December 31, 2010, compared to $(117.4) million at December 31, 2009, and is reported in other liabilities
in our consolidated balance sheets.

Fixed Maturity Securities

The fair value and associated unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity securities portfolio, by industry classification, as of December 31,
2010 are as follows:

Unrealized Loss on Below-Investment-Grade Fixed Maturity Securities

Length of Time in Unrealized Loss Position

(in millions of dollars)

At December 31, 2010, our mortgage/asset-backed securities had an average life of 4.43 years, effective duration of
3.82 years, and a weighted average credit rating of AAA. The mortgage/asset-backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing
services. One of the risks involved in investing in mortgage/asset-backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower
interest rate environment. We use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates. The timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of
investment income. We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities. Actual prepayment experience is
reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected. The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis,
and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income.

We have not invested in mortgage-backed derivatives, such as interest-only,
principal-only, or residuals, where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates. All of our mortgage-backed securities have fixed rate coupons. The credit quality of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio has not
been negatively impacted by the issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans. The change in value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agency-backed mortgage-backed securities.

As of December 31, 2010, the amortized cost and fair value of our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities was $2,668.9 million and $2,755.0
million, respectively. Below-investment-grade securities are inherently more risky than investment-grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher. Also, the secondary market for
certain below-investment-grade issues can be highly illiquid. Additional downgrades may occur, but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below-investment-grade securities, nor do we expect these investments to
adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity.



Index to Financial Statements

Mortgage Loans

Our mortgage loan portfolio was $1,516.8 million and $1,404.0 million on an amortized cost basis at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of
commercial mortgage loans. We believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types. The incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low. Due to conservative underwriting, we
expect the level of problem loans to remain low relative to the industry. At December 31, 2010, we held two mortgage loans which were considered impaired. The mortgage loans were carried at the estimated net realizable value of $22.9 million,
net of a valuation allowance of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2009, we held one mortgage loan which was considered impaired. This loan was carried at the estimated net realizable value of $2.0 million, net of a valuation allowance of $3.2
million.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment risk, duration, and currency risk. Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward
interest rate swaps, current and forward currency swaps, forward treasury locks, currency forward contracts, and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities. Our current credit exposure on derivatives, which is limited to the value of
those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held, was $14.8 million at December 31, 2010. The carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was $158.8 million at December 31, 2010. We
believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties, all of which are rated A or better by both Moody’s and S&P, and by our use of cross-collateralization agreements.

Other

Our
exposure to non-current investments, defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and/or principal payments, totaled $56.2 million and $35.5 million on a fair value basis at December 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively.

See Notes 3 and 4 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for
further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instruments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in our insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment
income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash. Debt and/or securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity. Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new
business (principally commissions), operating expenses, and taxes, as well as purchases of new investments.

We have established an investment
strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations. We attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business. However,
deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Furthermore, if we experience defaults on securities held in
the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries, this will negatively impact statutory capital, which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries’ capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies. A reduction in dividends to our holding
companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay our stockholder dividends or meet our debt and other payment obligations.

Our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities.
A decrease in demand



Index to Financial Statements

for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations. However, our historical pattern
of benefits paid to revenues is consistent, even during cycles of economic downturns, which serves to minimize liquidity risk.

We have met
all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by ERISA. We made voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan of $67.0 million and $100.0 million during the first and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively. The
fourth quarter of 2010 contribution was made in lieu of our planned 2011 contribution, and we do not anticipate making any additional contributions during 2011. We have estimated our future funding requirements under the Pension Protection
Act of 2006 and do not believe that the funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

We
also contribute to our U.K. pension plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under U.K. legislation. We made contributions of approximately £3.2 million during 2010, and we anticipate that we will make contributions during
2011 of approximately £3.2 million.

In September 2010, we issued $400.0 million of senior notes. These notes, due in 2020, bear
interest at a fixed-rate of 5.625%. The net proceeds are expected to be used for the repayment of our senior notes due March 2011 and for other general corporate purposes.

In May 2010, our board of directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend paid on Unum Group’s common stock, from $0.0825 per common share to $0.0925 per common share, effective with our
third quarter of 2010 dividend payment to stockholders.

In May 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million
of Unum Group’s common stock, with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price. During 2010, we repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a
cost of $356.0 million, including commissions of $0.3 million, under this share repurchase program. The dollar value of shares remaining under this program, which had an expiration date of May 2011, was $144.3 million at December 31, 2010.

On February 2, 2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Unum Group’s common stock, in
addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the previous authorization discussed above. The $1.0 billion share repurchase program has an expiration date of August 2012.

On February 4, 2011, we repurchased 7.1 million shares, at a cost of $200.0 million, using an accelerated repurchase agreement with a financial counterparty. As part of this transaction, we
simultaneously entered into a forward contract indexed to the price of Unum Group common stock, which subjects the transaction to a future price adjustment. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we may receive, or be required to pay, a price
adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount. Any price adjustment payable to us will be settled in shares of Unum Group common stock. Any price adjustment we are
required to pay will be settled in either cash or common stock at our option. We expect the price adjustment to settle on or before the completion of the accelerated repurchase agreement in April 2011. The shares repurchased pursuant to the
accelerated repurchase agreement completed the $500.0 million repurchase authorization and initiated the $1.0 billion repurchase program.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities held at Unum Group and our other intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us
and were approximately $1.2 billion and $915 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The December 31, 2010 balance was made up primarily of commercial paper, fixed maturity securities with a current average maturity of 2.3
years, and various money-market funds. No significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access these funds. We believe we hold sufficient resources to meet our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and that our current level
of holding company cash and marketable securities can be utilized to mitigate potential losses from defaults.

During 2011, we intend to
retain a level of capital in our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries such that we maintain a weighted average RBC well above capital adequacy requirements. We also expect Unum Limited to operate above FSA capital adequacy requirements and
minimum solvency margins.



Index to Financial Statements

Unum Limited is expected to adopt new capital requirements and risk management standards under Solvency II
effective January 1, 2013. Solvency II standards, which result from a fundamental review of the capital adequacy standards for the European insurance industry, are still being developed and have not yet been adopted. We continue to assess the
impact on our capital requirements. Certain of our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Last year the BMA initiated a comprehensive review of its insurance regulatory and solvency
framework and hopes to complete its assessment during the summer of 2011. It is too early to assess the impact on our insurance subsidiaries, but we may ultimately be subject to new rules regarding capital requirements. See “Capital
Requirements” contained herein in Item 1 for additional information.

Consolidated Cash Flows

Operating Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,196.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $1,237.0 million and $1,326.1 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating cash
flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income, offset by payments of claims, commissions, expenses, and income taxes. Premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales, but on renewals of existing business,
renewal price increases, and persistency. Investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and on the earned yield. The level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the
level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business. The level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the
general economy, as previously discussed in the operating results by segment. Operating cash flows for 2010, 2009, and 2008, include pension contributions of approximately $176.9 million, $79.7 million, and $140.9 million, respectively.

The fluctuation in the income tax adjustment to reconcile 2009 and 2008 net income to net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to
changes in the deferred tax asset related to the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement.

Investing Cash Flows

Investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds
from the sales and maturities of investments. Investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments. Net cash used by investing activities was $1,073.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010,
compared to $1,213.9 million and $424.7 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Our sales of available-for-sale securities declined in 2010
relative to 2009. Proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a significant increase in bond calls and bond maturities. Proceeds from sales and maturities of
available-for-sale securities in 2009 were lower than 2008 primarily due to lower sales of fixed maturity securities, a decrease in bond maturities and bonds that were called at par, and the translation of investment proceeds from our U.K.
operations at lower exchange rates.

Proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily
due to a decrease in proceeds from terminations of derivative contracts within our cash flow hedging programs. Proceeds from maturities of commercial mortgage loans were higher in 2010 relative to 2009. Proceeds from sales and maturities of other
investments increased in 2009 relative to 2008 primarily due to an increase in sales of other long-term investments and an increase in proceeds from terminations of derivatives within our cash flow hedging programs. This increase was partially
offset by a decline in proceeds from commercial mortgage loan maturities and prepayments.

Purchases of available-for-sale securities were
slightly lower during 2010 relative to 2009. Although investable funds were available for reinvestment due to the increase in proceeds from bond calls and maturities, as previously noted, the deployment of funds was hampered by the lack of available
long-term securities which met our investment objectives. Purchases of available-for-sale securities decreased during 2009 relative to 2008. This decrease resulted from fewer funds available for reinvestment as compared to 2008 due to the lower
level of



Index to Financial Statements

proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities and from the lower exchange rate for translation of purchases within our U.K. operations.

Purchases of other investments increased during 2010 relative to 2009 as a result of the purchase of tax credit partnerships, as well as a slight
increase in the funding of mortgage loans. Purchases of other investments in 2009 primarily related to mortgage loans.

Net purchases of
short-term investments increased during 2010 relative to 2009 due to the increase in bond calls and maturities, with the proceeds invested in short-term investments pending the purchase of fixed maturity securities. Net sales of short-term
investments decreased during 2009 relative to 2008 due to the sale of investments during 2008 to help fund the $700.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreements executed during 2008, as well as the 2008 transition to floating rate fixed
maturity securities in lieu of short-term investments. This decrease in proceeds was partially offset by the transition of our portfolio out of short-term investments into fixed maturity securities during 2009.

Proceeds from the acquisition of business in 2008 relate to the Unum UK acquisition of a group long-term disability claims portfolio.

Financing Cash Flows

Financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt, issuance or repurchase of common stock, and dividends paid to stockholders.
Net cash used by financing activities was $141.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $1.5 million and $1,049.5 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Net short-term debt repayments in 2009 consist of the purchase and retirement of the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% notes and the repayment of $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements
outstanding at December 31, 2008. Net short-term debt repayments in 2008 are comprised of the purchase and retirement of the remaining $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes and $17.8 million of our 5.859% notes, less the issuance of $58.3
million of reverse repurchase agreements.

During 2010, we received proceeds of $400.0 million, less debt issuance costs of $3.0 million and a
debt discount of $0.5 million, from the issuance of $400.0 million of 5.625% senior notes. During 2009, we received proceeds of $350.0 million, less debt issuance costs of $3.2 million, from the issuance of $350.0 million of 7.125% senior notes.

Long-term debt repayments include the 2010, 2009, and 2008 principal payments of $10.0 million each year on Tailwind Holdings’ floating
rate, senior secured non-recourse notes and the principal payments of $58.3 million, $48.0 million, and $59.3 million, respectively, on Northwind Holdings’ floating rate, senior secured non-recourse notes. Long-term debt repayments also include
the purchase and retirement of $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes in 2010, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes in 2009, and $36.6 million of our 6.85%
senior notes in 2008.

During 2010, we repurchased approximately 16.4 million shares of Unum Group’s common stock under our $500.0
million share repurchase program, at a cost of $356.0 million. During 2008, we completed a $700.0 million authorized share repurchase program by purchasing 29.9 million shares.

See “Debt” contained in this Item 7 for further information.

Cash Available from Subsidiaries

Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders, to pay debt obligations, and/or to pay expenses. These
payments by our insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, operating and investment management fees, and/or interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary.

Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in
any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities.



Index to Financial Statements

For life insurance companies domiciled in the United States, that limitation generally equals, depending on
the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer’s statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding
year. The payment of dividends to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned statutory surplus.

Unum Group and/or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from its United Kingdom-based affiliate, Unum Limited, subject to applicable insurance company
regulations and capital guidance in the United Kingdom.

Northwind Holdings’ and Tailwind Holdings’ ability to meet their debt
payment obligations is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from Northwind Re and Tailwind Re, respectively. The ability of Northwind Re and Tailwind Re to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of
applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Northwind Re and Tailwind Re.

The payment of dividends
to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary’s board of directors.

The amount
available during 2010 for the payment of ordinary dividends from Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries was $719.7 million, of which $410.8 million was declared and paid. The amount available during 2010 from Unum Limited was
£198.5 million, of which £50.0 million was declared and paid. During 2010, Tailwind Re and Northwind Re paid dividends of $18.8 million and $58.9 million to Tailwind Holdings and Northwind Holdings, respectively.

Although we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends, based on the restrictions under current law, $622.3 million is available during
2011 for the payment of ordinary dividends to Unum Group from its traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes Northwind Re and Tailwind Re, our special purpose financial captive insurance companies. Approximately
£207.5 million is available for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2011, subject to regulatory approval. However, it is unlikely that we will utilize the entire amount available during 2011.

Unum Group’s RBC ratio for its traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level
formula, was approximately 398 percent at the end of 2010, with the individual RBC ratios for Unum Group’s principal traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries all in excess of 300 percent. The individual RBC ratios for Northwind Re and Tailwind
Re are calculated using the NAIC Company Action Level formula and have target levels of 200 percent. The RBC ratios for Northwind Re and Tailwind Re each exceeded the 200 percent target level at the end of 2010. The individual RBC ratio for each of
our insurance subsidiaries is above the range that would require state regulatory action.

During 2008, Unum Group received $100.0 million
from an insurance subsidiary for the repayment of a surplus debenture issued to Unum Group in 1997 with a maturity date of October 2027.

The
ability of Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries generally depends on the level of earnings of those insurance subsidiaries and additional factors
such as RBC ratios and FSA capital adequacy requirements, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings. Insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of
dividends available for distribution from non-insurance subsidiaries except where the non-insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by Unum Group. We intend to retain a level of capital in
our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries such that we maintain a weighted average risk-based capital above capital adequacy requirements. We also expect Unum Limited to operate above FSA capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins.

Debt

At December 31, 2010, we had long-term debt, including senior secured notes and junior subordinated debt securities, totaling $2,631.3 million and short-term debt of $225.1 million. Short-term debt
consisted of the 7.625% senior notes due March 2011.

Our leverage ratio, when calculated using consolidated debt to total consolidated capital, was 25.9 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to 24.8 percent at December 31, 2009,
reflecting the issuance of $400.0 million of senior notes during the third quarter of 2010. Our leverage ratio, when calculated excluding the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings and Northwind Holdings, was 22.8 percent at
December 31, 2010 compared to 20.5 percent at the end of 2009. Leverage is measured as total debt to total capital, which we define as total long-term and short-term debt plus stockholders’ equity, excluding the net unrealized gain or loss
on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges. We believe that a leverage ratio which excludes the net unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, both of which tend to fluctuate depending on
market conditions and general economic trends, and which also excludes the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings and Northwind Holdings is a better indicator of our ability to meet our financial obligations.

We monitor our compliance with our debt covenants. There are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt
obligations. We remain in compliance with all debt covenants and have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants.

Purchases and Retirement of Debt

In 2010, we purchased and retired $10.0 million of our
7.08% medium-term notes due 2024. In 2009, we purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal
of our 6.75% notes due 2028. We also repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008. In 2008, we retired the remaining $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes due May 2008. We also purchased and retired
$36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015 and $17.8 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008,
Northwind Holdings made principal payments of $58.3 million, $48.0 million and $59.3 million, respectively, on its floating rate, senior secured non-recourse notes due 2037. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Tailwind Holdings made principal payments of
$10.0 million each year on its floating rate, senior secured non-recourse notes due 2036.

Issuance of Debt

In 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due in 2020, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.625% and
are payable semi-annually. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. In addition, these notes are effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of our
subsidiaries.

In 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a
fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

In 2007, Northwind Holdings issued $800.0 million floating rate, insured, senior, secured notes, due 2037, in a private offering. Recourse for the payment of principal, interest, and other amounts due on
the notes will be limited to the assets of Northwind Holdings, consisting primarily of the stock of its sole subsidiary Northwind Re, a Vermont special purpose financial captive insurance company. Northwind Holdings’ ability to meet its payment
obligations under the notes will be dependent principally upon its receipt of dividends from Northwind Re. The ability of Northwind Re to pay dividends to Northwind Holdings will depend on its satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and
on the performance of the reinsured claims of Provident, Paul Revere and Unum America (the ceding insurers) reinsured by Northwind Re. None of Unum Group, the ceding insurers, Northwind Re or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings is an obligor
or guarantor on the notes. The balance outstanding on these notes was $634.4 million at December 31, 2010.



Index to Financial Statements

In 2006, Tailwind Holdings issued $130.0 million floating rate, insured, senior, secured notes, due 2036, in
a private offering. Recourse for the payment of principal, interest, and other amounts due on the notes will be limited to the assets of Tailwind Holdings, consisting primarily of the stock of its sole subsidiary Tailwind Re, a South Carolina
special purpose financial captive insurance company. Tailwind Holdings’ ability to meet its payment obligations under the notes will be dependent principally upon its receipt of dividends from Tailwind Re. The ability of Tailwind Re to pay
dividends to Tailwind Holdings will depend on its satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the reinsured claims of Unum America reinsured by Tailwind Re. None of Unum Group, Unum America, Tailwind Re or any other
affiliate of Tailwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor on the notes. The balance outstanding on these notes was $82.5 million at December 31, 2010.

In 2005, Unum Group repatriated $454.8 million in unremitted foreign earnings from its U.K. subsidiaries, and as part of its repatriation plan, UnumProvident Finance Company plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Unum Group, issued $400.0 million of 6.85% senior debentures, due 2015, in a private offering. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Unum Group. The aggregate principal amount outstanding was $296.9 million at
December 31, 2010.

In 2002, Unum Group completed two long-term offerings, issuing $250.0 million of 7.375% senior debentures due 2032
and $150.0 million of 7.25% public income notes due 2032. The public income notes were called and retired in 2007. The 7.375% notes have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $39.5 million at December 31, 2010.

In 2001, Unum Group issued $575.0 million of 7.625% senior notes due March 2011. The aggregate principal amount outstanding was $225.1 million at
December 31, 2010.

In 1998, Unum Group completed public offerings of $200.0 million of 7.25% senior notes due 2028, $200.0 million of
7.0% senior notes due 2018, and $250.0 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2028. None of these amounts have been reduced other than the 6.75% notes, which have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $165.8 million at December 31, 2010.

In 1998, Provident Financing Trust I (the trust) issued $300.0 million of 7.405% capital securities in a public offering. These capital
securities, which mature in 2038, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Unum Group, have a liquidation value of $1,000 per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances. Unum Group issued 7.405% junior
subordinated deferrable interest debentures, which mature in 2038, to the trust in connection with the capital securities offering. The securities issued by the trust have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $226.5 million at
December 31, 2010.

Unum Group has medium-term notes with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $50.8 million at December 31,
2010 which were initially issued in three separate series in 1990, 1993, and 1996, pursuant to an indenture dated September 15, 1990. The notes are fixed maturity rate notes with fixed maturity dates ranging between nine months to thirty
years from the issuance date.

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest paid on long-term and short-term debt and related securities during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $140.7 million, $122.0 million, and $157.3 million, respectively.

Shelf Registration

We
have a shelf registration, which became effective in December 2008, with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase
contracts, units and warrants, or preferred securities of wholly-owned finance trusts. As stated previously, we issued $350.0 million and $400.0 million of senior notes against our open shelf registration on September 30, 2009, and
September 15, 2010, respectively. The shelf registration enables us to raise funds from the offering of any individual security covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof, subject to market conditions and our capital
needs.

See Note 7 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for
additional information.

Commitments

The following table summarizes contractual obligations and our reinsurance recoverable by period as of December 31, 2010 (in millions of dollars):

Excluded from the preceding table are tax liabilities of approximately $114.0 million for which we are unable to make
reasonably reliable estimates of the period of potential cash settlements, if any, with taxing authorities. It is possible that during 2011 we may reach a final settlement with the Internal Revenue Service concerning audit adjustments for certain
tax years, and if so, it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within 12 months by $0 to $40.0 million. See Note 6 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in
Item 8 for additional information.

Short-term and long-term debt includes contractual principal and interest payments and therefore
exceeds the amount shown in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for additional information.

Policyholder liability maturities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in-force policyholder liabilities
and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties as to the timing and amount of claim payments. We utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in-force
business. The primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity, claim resolution rates, persistency rates, and interest rates. These cash flows are discounted to determine the current value
of the projected claim payments. The timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly from the projections above. See our previous



Index to Financial Statements

discussion of asset and liability management under “Investments” contained in this Item 7 and Note 1 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein
in Item 8 for additional information.

Pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations include our defined benefit pension and
postretirement plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans. Pension plan obligations, other than the non-qualified plans, represent our contributions to the pension plans. Amounts in the one year or less category equal our planned
contributions within the next 12 months. The remaining years’ contributions are projected based on the expected future contributions as required under ERISA. Non-qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit obligations represent the
expected benefit payments related to these plans. The pensions and other postretirement benefit projections are not discounted with respect to interest and therefore exceed the amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Estimates” contained in this Item 7 for additional information.

Miscellaneous liabilities include commissions due and accrued, deferred compensation liabilities, state premium taxes payable, amounts due to reinsurance companies, accounts payable, obligations to return
unrestricted cash collateral to our derivatives counterparties, and various other liabilities that represent contractual obligations. Obligations where the timing of the payment was uncertain are included in the one year or less category. See Note 4
of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our derivatives.

We have commitments of $169.9 million to fund certain tax credit partnerships. These commitments, which are represented in the purchase obligations line
on the preceding schedule, are legally binding and will be funded over the next several years.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

As noted in the preceding commitments table, we have operating lease commitments totaling $220.1 million at
December 31, 2010. Operating leases include noncancelable obligations on certain office space, equipment, and software. During 2010, we signed a noncancelable operating lease for office space that will commence in 2013. The lease will expire in
2029, but we will have a renewal option through 2044. The projected lease payments, along with commitments of $0.8 million to fund leasehold improvements, are included in the preceding commitments table.

Purchase obligations include off-balance sheet commitments of $147.7 million to fund certain of our investments in private placement securities,
commercial mortgage loans, and private equity partnerships. These are shown in the preceding table based on the expiration date of the commitments. The funds will be due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from the partnership trustee or issuer
of the private placement securities. The amounts may or may not be funded. Also included are noncancelable obligations with outside parties for computer data processing services and related functions and software maintenance agreements. The
aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was $35.8 million at December 31, 2010.

As part of our regular investing strategy,
we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and also short-term agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date. For both types of
transactions, we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral. Generally, cash is received as collateral under these agreements. In
the event that securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them. We also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and
also short-term agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date. At December 31, 2010, we had no fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to third parties under these programs.

To help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain
position can be offset against contracts in a loss position. We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives. These agreements require the
counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount. Our current credit



Index to Financial Statements

exposure on derivatives, which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held, was $14.8 million at December 31, 2010. We post fixed maturity
securities as collateral to our counterparties rather than cash. The carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was $158.8 million at December 31, 2010.

Our derivatives counterparties have posted non-cash collateral in various segregated custody accounts to which we have a security interest in the event
of counterparty default. This collateral, which is not reflected in the preceding table, had a market value of $17.3 million at December 31, 2010.

Transfers of Financial Assets

To manage our cash position more efficiently, we
enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become
available from our operations or existing investments. Our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than 30 days. We post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase
securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later, specified date. The fair value of collateral posted is generally 102 percent of the cash received.

As previously noted, our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending transactions, which increase our
investment income with minimal risk. We had no securities lending transactions during 2010.

We account for all of our securities lending
transactions and repurchase agreements as collateralized financings. We had no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2010. The average balance during 2010 was $39.4 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was
$150.4 million. Our use of repurchase agreements can fluctuate during any given period, depending on our liquidity position, the availability of long-term investments that meet our purchasing criteria, and our general business needs.

Ratings

AM Best, Fitch, Moody’s,
and S&P are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. Issuer credit ratings reflect an agency’s opinion of the overall financial capacity of a
company to meet its senior debt obligations. Financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency’s view of the overall financial strength (capital levels, earnings, growth, investments,
business mix, operating performance, and market position) of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative
analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.

We compete based in part on the financial strength
ratings provided by rating agencies. A downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services
and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, particularly large case group sales and individual sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum
Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital.



Index to Financial Statements

The table below reflects the issuer credit ratings for Unum Group and the financial strength ratings for
each of our traditional insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

We maintain an ongoing dialogue with the four rating agencies that evaluate us in order to
inform them of progress we are making regarding our strategic objectives and financial plans, as well as other pertinent issues. A significant component of our communications involves our annual review meeting with each of the four agencies. We hold
other meetings throughout the year regarding our business, including, but not limited to, quarterly updates.

On February 12, 2010, Fitch
upgraded its ratings of Unum Group and its operating subsidiaries to BBB and A, respectively, and changed the outlook for the Company to “stable.” On March 8, 2010, AM Best affirmed its ratings of Unum Group and all of its operating
subsidiaries, with the exception of Paul Revere Variable, and revised the outlook for the Company to “positive.” The rating of Paul Revere Variable was lowered to B++ due to the continued decline in this subsidiary’s closed block of
business. On May 12, 2010, Moody’s upgraded the credit ratings of Unum Group’s senior debt to Baa3 from Ba1 and the financial strength ratings of each rated individual insurance subsidiary to A3 from Baa1. Moody’s maintained the
outlook for the Company as “stable.” On January 26, 2011, AM Best upgraded its ratings of Unum Group and its operating subsidiaries to bbb and A, respectively, with the exception of Paul Revere Variable which retained its B++ rating,
and revised the outlook for the Company and its subsidiaries to “stable.”

There have been no other changes in any of the rating
agencies’ outlook statements or ratings during 2010 or prior to the date of this filing.

Agency ratings are not directed toward the
holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be regarded as an independent
assessment, not conditional on any other rating. Given the dynamic nature of the ratings process, changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near-term. Based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our
improved insurance risk profile, our financial flexibility, our operating performance, and the quality of our investment portfolio, we do not expect any negative actions from any of the four rating agencies related to either Unum Group’s
current issuer credit ratings or the financial strength ratings of its insurance subsidiaries. However, in the event that we are unable to meet the rating agency specific guideline values to maintain our current ratings, including but not limited to
maintenance of our capital management metrics at the threshold values stated and maintenance of our financial flexibility and operational consistency, we could be placed on a negative credit watch, with a potential for a downgrade to both our issuer
credit ratings and our financial strength ratings.

See “Ratings” contained herein in Item 1 and “Risk Factors”
contained herein in Item 1A for further discussion.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to various market risk exposures, including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The following discussion
regarding our risk management activities includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur
(sensitivity analysis). Caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below, as actual results may differ. See “Investments” contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 2, 3, and 4 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk, including derivative financial instrument activity.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to
interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments, derivatives, and interest-sensitive liabilities. Fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, policy loans, and
short-term investments. Fixed maturity securities include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and redeemable preferred stock, all of which are subject to risk
resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Certain of our financial instruments, fixed maturity securities and derivatives, are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely
affected by changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates may increase the net unrealized loss related to these financial instruments, but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities.
Conversely, a decline in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized loss, but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return. Although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates
may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments, terminate derivative positions, determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired, or
determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge.

Other fixed rate investments, such as mortgage loans and policy
loans, are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances, respectively, rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. These investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance
sheets. A change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value. A change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans, as
ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans. Carrying amounts for short-term investments approximate fair value, and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk
exposure from these investments.

We believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is
minimal, primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries, the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies, and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding
requirements of our business. We may in certain circumstances, however, need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements, changes in tax laws, rating agency decisions, and/or unexpected changes in liquidity needs.

Although the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive and we therefore have minimal
exposure to policy withdrawal risk, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk, which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching
of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts. Changes in interest rates and individuals’ behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows. We actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match
and our asset and liability duration match to mitigate interest rate risk. Due to the long duration of the our long-term care product, we may be unable to purchase appropriate assets with cash flows and durations such that the timing and/or amount
of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities. Sustained periods of low interest rates could result in lower than expected profitability or increases in reserves. We model and test asset and liability portfolios to
improve interest rate risk management and net yields. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to
prepare for disadvantageous



Index to Financial Statements

outcomes. This analysis is the precursor to our activities in derivative financial instruments. We use current and forward interest rate swaps, options on forward interest rate swaps, and forward
treasury locks to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities.

Short-term and
long-term debt are not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. If we modify or replace existing short-term or long-term debt instruments at current market rates, we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction. We believe our
debt-related risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal. In the near term, we expect that our need for external financing is small, but changes in our business could increase our need.

We measure our financial instruments’ market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates
potential changes in fair values as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 based on a hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest
rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.

The hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown as follows:



Index to Financial Statements

(1) These assets
and liabilities are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets with a
corresponding offsetting change reported in other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes.

(2) The
adjustment to reserves and other for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and policyholder liabilities that would be necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the
fixed maturity securities and derivatives had been realized. Changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes.

The effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of
each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates. The effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage-backed securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic
system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage-backed securities. These hypothetical prices were compared to the actual
prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value. The changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flows analyses. Because we actively manage our investments and
liabilities, actual changes could be less than those estimated above.

Foreign Currency Risk

The functional currency of our U.K. operations is the British pound sterling. We are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the
British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our U.K. operations. Fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results. We
do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk. Because we do not actually convert pounds into dollars except for a limited number of transactions, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of
operations or profitability in the U.K.

Assuming the pound to dollar exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the December 31, 2010 and
2009 levels, stockholders’ equity as reported in U.S. dollars as of and for the periods then ended would have been lower by



Index to Financial Statements

approximately $106.0 million and $98.6 million, respectively. Assuming the pound to dollar average exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the actual average exchange rates for 2010 and 2009,
segment operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax, as reported in U.S. dollars would have decreased approximately $22.5 million and $27.1 million, respectively, for the years then ended.

Dividends paid by Unum Limited are generally held at our U.K. finance subsidiary. If these funds are repatriated to our U.S. holding company, we would at
that time be subject to foreign currency risk as the value of the dividend, when converted into U.S. dollars, would be dependent upon the foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion.

We are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to certain foreign investment securities denominated in local currencies and U.S. dollar-denominated debt issued by one of our U.K. subsidiaries. We
use current and forward currency swaps and currency forward contracts to hedge or minimize the foreign exchange risk associated with these instruments.

See “Unum UK Segment” contained herein in Item 7 for further information concerning foreign currency translation.

Risk Management

As an insurer, we are in the business of risk management. Effectively
taking and managing risks is essential to the success of our Company. To facilitate this effort, we have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. Our ERM program strives to:

•

Identify, measure, mitigate, and report on our risk positions and exposures, including notable risk events;

•

Assess material risks, including how they affect us, how individual risks interrelate, and how management addresses these risks;

•

Practice strong risk management, including diversification across and within business units and systematic limit monitoring;

•

Identify emerging risks and analyze how material future risks might affect us;

•

Fulfill regulatory, rating agency, and governance objectives; and

•

Maintain our risk appetite policy and report against its tolerance and limits.

Through adherence to these objectives, we believe we are better positioned to fulfill our corporate mission, improve and protect stockholder value, and
reduce reputational risk.

Our approach to risk management is defined by these fundamental principles:

•

Our risk management strategy begins with our business strategy. We are a specialty insurance carrier focused on providing benefits through
employer-sponsored plans. We have market leadership positions in the product lines we offer and more than 160 years of experience. This combination of focused expertise and deep experience is the foundation of our approach to risk management.

•

Risk management cannot be successful in a vacuum; it needs to be embedded in daily decision-making throughout the organization. Unum Group’s board
members and our senior leaders clearly acknowledge that risk management is critical to our Company’s long-term success, and this theme cascades through the work of risk committees and the management team. Additionally, we believe the individual
and collective decisions of our employees play a key role in successfully managing our overall risk profile.

•

We closely monitor emerging risks, adjust our strategies as appropriate, and hold capital levels which provide financial flexibility. We use
qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify emerging risks and develop mitigating strategies to limit our exposure to existing and potential risks.

We utilize stress testing and scenario analysis to shape our business, financial, and strategic planning activities. For example, stress testing of our capital and liquidity management strategies enables
us to identify areas of high exposure, assess mitigating actions, develop contingency plans, and guide decisions around our capital and liquidity levels. In addition, scenario analysis is used as input in the development of our business and
strategic planning processes.

Risk Committee Structure and Role

We have a “pyramid” risk committee structure in place to govern our ERM process.

Unum Group’s board of directors has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of our risks. The board is responsible for managing strategic risk and
regularly reviews information regarding our capital, liquidity, and operations, as well as the risks associated with each, and receives an enterprise risk management report from our chief risk officer at least annually, and usually more frequently.
The audit committee is responsible for oversight of our risk management process, financial risk, operational risk, and any other risk not specifically assigned to another committee. The chief risk officer provides a report on our risk and risk
management to the audit committee at least quarterly. The finance committee is responsible for oversight of risks associated with investments and related financial matters. The human capital committee is responsible for overseeing the management of
risks relating to our compensation plans and programs; in connection with this oversight it receives an analysis from the chief risk officer with respect to these risks. The regulatory compliance committee oversees management of risks related to
regulatory, compliance, policy, and legal matters, both current and emerging and whether of a local, state, federal, or international nature. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such
risks, the entire board of directors is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks in addition to the risk information it receives directly.

An executive risk management committee is responsible for overseeing our enterprise-wide risk management program. The chief risk officer, who is a member of the executive risk management committee, has
primary responsibility for our ERM program and is supported by a corporate risk committee and by the risk committees of the three primary operating segments that comprise Unum Group.

Operating segment risk committees for Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial Life oversee risk specific to their business. These committees are responsible for identifying, measuring, reporting, and managing
insurance and operational risks within their respective areas, consistent with corporate guidance.

The corporate risk committee oversees the
operational, investment, and capital management subcommittees and reviews risk on a corporate level. Market and credit risk are jointly managed by the investment committee and the asset liability committee. The capital management committee is
responsible for monitoring and planning capital allocation, financing, and liquidity.

In addition to the formal communication channels
included in the risk committee structure, we provide ways for employees to report risk directly to the chief risk officer, and we educate employees on Company risks.

Governance, Risk, and Compliance

We employ a decentralized risk management model
under which risk-based decisions are made daily on a local level. To achieve long-term success, we believe risk management must be the responsibility of all employees. We strive for a culture of accountability, risk management, and strict
compliance, and we believe these values allow our employees to feel comfortable identifying issues as well as taking ownership for addressing potential problems.

The recent recession and financial sector problems have reinforced the importance of effective governance, risk management, and compliance. We rely on four complementary functions.

•

Internal controls provide reasonable assurance that there are controls in place to prevent and detect a material misstatement in our financial
reporting;

•

Internal audits assess the effectiveness of controls for operational business processes and monitor compliance with internal policies and procedures;

•

Our compliance organization seeks to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and is responsible for directing our ethics program and privacy
efforts; and

•

The ERM program serves as an umbrella and takes a holistic view of risks and risk management efforts across the enterprise.

These groups work closely together to align their plans, activities, and efforts toward the common goal of effective
governance, risk, and compliance.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Unum Group

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unum Group and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Unum Group and subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Unum Group and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

: The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Unum Group and its subsidiaries (the Company) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP). Such accounting principles differ from statutory accounting principles (see Note 14). Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. In connection with our preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we evaluated events
that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2010, for recognition or disclosure in our financial statements and notes to our financial statements.

Description of Business

: We are the largest provider of group and individual disability products in the United States and the United Kingdom. We also provide a complementary portfolio of other
insurance products, including long-term care insurance, life insurance, employer- and employee-paid group benefits, and other related services. We market our products primarily to employers interested in providing benefits to their employees.

We have three major business segments: Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial Life. Our other reporting segments are the Individual Disability -
Closed Block segment and the Corporate and Other segment. See Note 12 for further discussion of our operating segments.

Use of
Estimates

: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change
in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.

Many factors influence the
assumptions upon which reserves for policy and contract benefits are based, including historical trends in our experience and expected deviations from historical experience. Considerable judgment is required to interpret actual historical experience
and to assess the future factors that are likely to influence the ultimate cost of settling existing claims. Given that insurance products contain inherent risks and uncertainties, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such estimates
indicate.

Fixed Maturity Securities

: Fixed maturity securities include bonds and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed maturity
securities not bought and held for the purpose of selling in the near term but for which we do not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, except for amounts related to other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings, are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. These amounts are net of income tax and valuation
adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and reserves for future policy and contract benefits which would have been recorded had the related unrealized gain or loss on these securities been realized.

Interest income is recorded as part of net investment income when earned, using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and
accretion of discount. Included within fixed maturity securities are mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the
underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual
prepayments received and currently projected. The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income. For fixed maturity securities on which collection of investment income is
uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income when interest and dividends are received. Payment terms specified for fixed maturity securities may include a prepayment penalty for unscheduled payoff of the
investment. Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received.



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other
than temporary, we evaluate available information, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis
of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most
critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary. The significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors, but we generally do not
record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security. See also Note 2.

Mortgage Loans

: Mortgage loans are generally held for investment and are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for probable losses. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the
loan based on the loan’s contractual interest rate. Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received.

We use a
comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for further inspection, analysis, and reevaluation. For mortgage loans on which collection of investment income is
uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income in the period when an interest payment is received. We typically do not resume the accrual of interest on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status until there are
significant improvements in the underlying financial condition of the borrower. We consider a loan to be delinquent if full payment is not received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when,
based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of
individual loans and considering the underlying collateral, the value of which is periodically assessed. We do not purchase mortgage loans with existing credit impairments.

Policy Loans

: Policy loans are presented at unpaid balances directly related to policyholders. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan’s contractual
interest rate. Included in policy loans are $2,790.5 million and $2,675.7 million of policy loans ceded to reinsurers at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Other Long-term Investments

: Other long-term investments are comprised primarily of freestanding derivatives with a net positive fair value, tax credit partnerships, and private equity
partnerships. Freestanding derivatives are more fully described in the derivatives accounting policy which follows.

Tax credit partnerships
in which we have invested were formed for the purpose of investing in the construction and rehabilitation of low-income housing. Because the partnerships are structured such that there is no return of principal, the primary sources of
investment return from our tax credit partnerships are tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments, both of which may exhibit variability over the life of the investment. These partnerships are accounted for
using either the equity or the effective yield method, depending primarily on whether the tax credits are guaranteed through a letter of credit, a tax indemnity agreement, or another similar arrangement. Tax credits received from these partnerships
are reported in our consolidated statements of income as either a reduction of state premium tax, included in other expenses, or a reduction of income tax. For those partnerships accounted for under the equity method, the amortization of the
principal amount invested in these partnerships is reported as a component of net investment income. For those partnerships accounted for under the effective yield method, amortization of the principal amount invested is reported as a component of
income tax or other expenses.

Our investments in private equity partnerships are passive in nature.
The underlying investments held by these partnerships include both equity and debt securities and are accounted for using the equity or cost method,



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

depending on the level of ownership and the degree of influence over partnership operating and financial policies. For partnerships accounted for under the equity method, our portion of
partnership earnings is reported as a component of net investment income in our consolidated statements of income. For those partnerships accounted for under the cost method, we record income received from partnership distributions as either a
component of net investment income or of net realized investment gain or loss, in accordance with the source of the funds distributed from the partnership.

Short-term Investments

: Short-term investments are carried at cost. Short-term investments include investments maturing within one year, such as corporate commercial paper and U.S. Treasury bills,
bank term deposits, and other cash accounts and cash equivalents earning interest.

Cash and Bank Deposits

: Cash and bank deposits
include cash on hand and non-interest bearing cash and deposit accounts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

: Derivative financial
instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recognized as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are reported at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a
derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging transaction, we formally
document the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as the designation of the hedge as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Included in this documentation is how the hedging instrument is
expected to hedge the designated risk(s) related to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions as well as a description of the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the
hedging instrument’s effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk(s) of the hedged item.
Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship, using qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods include comparison of critical terms of the derivative
to the hedged item. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. For those derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments,
the derivative is designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as one of the following:

•

Fair value hedge

. Changes in the fair value of the derivative, including amounts measured as ineffectiveness, and changes in the fair value of
the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value. The gain or loss on the termination of a fair value hedge
is recognized in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss. When interest rate swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships, periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related
settlements of the hedged items.

•

Cash flow hedge

. To the extent it is effective, changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income and
reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in current
earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value. The gain or loss on the termination of an effective cash flow hedge is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings
and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Gains or losses on the termination of ineffective hedges are reported in current earnings as a component
of net realized investment gain or loss. In the event a hedged item is disposed of or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer likely to occur, we will terminate the related derivative and recognize the gain or loss on termination in
current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss. In the event a hedged item is disposed of subsequent to the termination of the hedging transaction, we reclassify any remaining gain or loss on the cash flow hedge out of
accumulated other comprehensive income into current earnings as a component of the same income statement line item wherein we report the gain or loss on disposition of the hedged item.

Our freestanding derivatives all qualify as hedges and have been designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. We do not have any speculative positions in our freestanding derivatives. For a
derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the change in fair value is recognized in earnings during the period of change. Changes in the fair values of certain embedded derivatives are reported as realized investment gains and losses during
the period of change.

In our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the
same counterparty under a master netting agreement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from those master netting agreements.

Fair Value Measurement

: All of our fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value. Our derivative financial instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. We hold an immaterial amount of equity securities, which are also reported at fair value. We define fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value represents an exit price, not an entry price. The exit price objective applies
regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date.

Valuation techniques used for
assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types: the market approach, the income approach, and the cost approach. We use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for
which sufficient data are available. In some cases, a single valuation technique will be appropriate. In other cases, multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate. If we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value, we evaluate and
weigh the results, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.

The selection of the valuation method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being
valued. For assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. Inputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions
that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation
technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources.
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

We prioritize the inputs to fair valuation techniques and use unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available. We categorize
our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to inputs which are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). See also Note 2.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Realized Investment Gains and Losses

: Realized investment gains and losses are reported as a
component of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and are based upon specific identification of the investments sold. If we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary, the investment is written down to
fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period, either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income, as applicable. Other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell
or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. For securities which we do not intend to sell
and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present
value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. For fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an
other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings, if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is
accreted as net investment income.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

: Certain costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are
primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred. Such costs include commissions, other agency compensation, certain selection and policy issue expenses, and certain field expenses. Acquisition costs that do not vary with the
production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral. Deferred acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue
and loss recognition testing in subsequent years.

Deferred acquisition costs related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium
paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of total expected premium income. Such amortization is adjusted quarterly to reflect the actual policy
persistency as compared to the anticipated experience.

Deferred acquisition costs related to interest-sensitive policies are amortized over
the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins. Adjustments are made quarterly to reflect actual experience for assumptions
which deviate significantly compared to anticipated experience.

Internal replacement transactions wherein the modification does not
substantially change the policy are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy, and the costs of
replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred. Internal replacement transactions, principally on group contracts, that result in a policy that is substantially changed are accounted for as an
extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed, and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized
in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs.

Loss recognition is generally performed on an annual basis.
Insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If loss recognition testing indicates that deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable, the deficiency is charged to expense.
The assumptions used in loss recognition testing represent our best estimates of future experience.

Goodwill

: Goodwill is the excess
of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

goodwill. The fair values of the reporting units are determined using discounted cash flow models. The critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings and the
discount rate. We set our discount rate assumption based on an expected risk adjusted cost of capital. If the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates is less than the carrying amount of the unamortized goodwill, the
carrying amount is reduced with a corresponding charge to expense.

Property and Equipment

: Property and equipment is reported at cost
less accumulated depreciation, which is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. The accumulated depreciation for property and equipment was $641.6 million and $619.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

Value of Business Acquired

: Value of business acquired represents the present value of future profits recorded in
connection with the acquisition of a block of insurance policies. The asset is amortized based upon expected future premium income for traditional insurance policies and estimated future gross profits for interest-sensitive insurance policies. The
value of business acquired, which is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, was $37.6 million and $46.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The accumulated amortization for value of business acquired was
$112.5 million and $108.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The amortization of value of business acquired, which
is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income, was $7.4 million, $7.8 million, and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We periodically review the carrying amount of value of
business acquired using the same methods used to evaluate deferred acquisition costs.

Policy and Contract Benefits

: Policy and
contract benefits represent amounts paid and expected to be paid based on reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported losses for traditional life and accident and health products. For interest-sensitive products, benefits are the
amounts paid and expected to be paid on insured claims in excess of the policyholders’ policy fund balances.

Policy and Contract
Benefits Liabilities

: Policy reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims not yet incurred. Policy reserves for traditional life and accident and health products are determined using the net level premium method. The
reserves are calculated based upon assumptions as to interest, persistency, morbidity, and mortality that were appropriate at the date of issue. Interest rate assumptions are based on actual and expected net investment returns. Persistency
assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations. Morbidity and mortality assumptions are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future
expectations. The assumptions vary by plan, year of issue, and policy duration and include a provision for adverse deviation.

Policy reserves
for group single premium annuities have been provided on a net single premium method. The reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to interest, mortality, and retirement that were appropriate at the date of issue. Mortality assumptions are
based upon industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations. The assumptions vary by year of issue.

Policy reserves for interest-sensitive products are principally policyholder account values.

We
perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test, without a provision for adverse deviation. We group the policy reserves for each major
product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing
policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency.



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Claim reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims that have been incurred or are
estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us. Our claim reserves relate primarily to disability policies and are calculated based on assumptions as to interest and claim resolution rates that are currently appropriate. Claim resolution
rate assumptions are based on our actual experience. The interest rate assumptions used for discounting claim reserves are based on projected portfolio yield rates, after consideration for defaults and investment expenses, for the assets supporting
the liabilities for the various product lines. Unlike policy reserves, claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future experience change.

Policyholders’ Funds

: Policyholders’ funds represent customer deposits plus interest credited at contract rates. We control interest rate risk by investing in quality assets which have an
aggregate duration that closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities.

Income Tax

: Deferred taxes reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes have been measured using enacted statutory income tax rates and
laws that are currently in effect. We record deferred tax assets for tax positions taken in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of whether a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on
its technical merits. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized.

Short-term and Long-term Debt

: Short-term and long-term debt are carried at the unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discount or premium. Short-term debt is debt due within the next twelve
months, including that portion of debt otherwise classified as long-term. Original issue discount or premium as well as debt issue costs are recognized as a component of interest expense over the period the debt is expected to be outstanding. The
carrying amount of long-term debt that is part of a fair value hedge program includes an adjustment to reflect the effect of the change in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. Net interest settlements for fair value hedges on our
long-term debt are recognized as a component of interest expense.

Treasury Stock

: Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity at cost.

Revenue Recognition

:

Traditional life and accident and health products are long-duration
contracts, and premium income is recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. If the contracts are experience rated, the estimated ultimate premium is recognized as revenue over the period of the contract. The estimated ultimate premium, which
is revised to reflect current experience, is based on estimated claim costs, expenses, and profit margins.

For interest-sensitive products,
the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits, and only the deductions during the period for cost of insurance, policy administration, and surrenders are included in revenue. Policyholders’ funds represent funds deposited by
contract holders and are not included in revenue.

Reinsurance

: We routinely enter into reinsurance agreements with other insurance
companies to spread risk and thereby limit losses from large exposures. For each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable
accounting standards. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.

Reinsurance activity is accounted for on a basis consistent with the terms of the reinsurance contracts and the accounting used for the original policies
issued. Premium income and benefits and change in reserves for future benefits are presented in our consolidated statements of income net of reinsurance ceded. Ceded policy and contract benefits, ceded future policy and contract benefits, ceded
unearned premiums, and ceded policy loans are reported on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. Our reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due from



Index to Financial Statements

reinsurers under the terms of the reinsurance agreements for these ceded balances as well as settlement amounts currently due.

Where applicable, gains or losses on reinsurance transactions are deferred and amortized into earnings based upon expected future premium income for traditional insurance policies and estimated future
gross profits for interest-sensitive insurance policies. The deferred gain on reinsurance included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $100.2 million and $123.1 million, respectively.

Under ceded reinsurance agreements wherein we are not relieved of our legal liability to our policyholders, if the assuming reinsurer is
unable to meet its obligations, we remain contingently liable. We evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. We may also require assets in trust, letters of credit, or other
acceptable collateral to support our reinsurance recoverable balances. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, certain amounts reported in our reinsurance recoverable could
become uncollectible, in which case the reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance.

Premium Tax Expense

: Premium tax expense is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. For the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, premium tax expense was $129.4 million, $130.2 million, and $133.2 million, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

: The cost of stock-based compensation is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We use the
Black-Scholes options valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options and the Monte-Carlo model for estimating the fair value of our performance restricted stock units. Nonvested stock awards are valued based on the market value of
common stock at the grant date, and cash-settled awards are measured each reporting period based on the current stock price. Stock-based awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately, and stock-based awards that require future
service are amortized over the relevant service period, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital in stockholders’ equity.

Earnings Per Share

: We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Earnings per share assuming dilution is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of stock-based awards. We use the treasury stock
method to account for the effect of outstanding stock options, nonvested stock awards, and performance restricted stock units on the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution.

Translation of Foreign Currency

: Revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the
balance sheet dates. The translation gain or loss is generally reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax.

Accounting for Participating Individual Life Insurance

: Participating policies issued by one of our subsidiaries prior to its 1986 conversion from
a mutual to a stock life insurance company will remain participating as long as the policies remain in-force. A Participation Fund Account (PFA) was established for the benefit of all such individual participating life and annuity policies and
contracts. The assets of the PFA provide for the benefit, dividend, and certain expense obligations of the participating individual life insurance policies and annuity contracts. The assets of the PFA were $364.4 million and $359.8 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Accounting Updates Adopted in 2010:

Accounting Standards Codification (ASC 310) “Receivables”

In July 2010, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to require additional disclosures regarding the credit quality of financing receivables, including the entity’s credit risk exposure, its assessment of risk in estimating its
allowance for credit losses, changes in the allowance for credit losses, and the reason for those changes. The disclosure requirements of this update have staggered effective dates. We adopted the disclosures around the entity’s credit risk
exposure and its assessment of risk in estimating its allowance for credit losses effective December 31, 2010. The adoption of this update expanded our disclosures but had no effect on our financial position or results of operation.

ASC 810 “Consolidation”

In
June 2009, the FASB issued an update to require a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require enhanced disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement with a
variable interest entity. We adopted this update effective January 1, 2010. The adoption of this update had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”

In January 2010, the FASB
issued an update to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Specifically, the update requires a reporting entity to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the three tier
fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers, as well as the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3, effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The update also requires information in the
reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2010. We adopted this update in its entirety, including
early adoption of the additional Level 3 information, effective January 1, 2010. The adoption of this update expanded our disclosures but had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ASC 860 “Transfers and Servicing”

In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special-purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and eliminate the exception that permitted sale accounting for
certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets. In addition, this update clarifies certain requirements for financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting and requires
enhanced disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. We adopted this update effective January 1, 2010. The adoption of this update had no effect
on our financial position or results of operations.

Accounting Updates Adopted in 2009:

ASC 105 “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”

In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for
SEC

registrants. We adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009. The adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ASC 320 “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities”

In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of
previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments. The measure of impairment remains fair value. Under the standard, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss
position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.

The amount of impairment recognized is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value. For all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet either of these two criteria,
the standard requires that an entity analyze its ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the present value of cash flows with the amortized cost of the security. If the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be
collected is less than the amortized cost of the security, an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded. The impairment loss is separated into two components, the portion of the impairment related to credit and the portion related to factors other
than credit. The credit-related portion of an other-than-temporary impairment, which is the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, is recognized in earnings.

Other-than-temporary impairments related to factors other than credit are charged to earnings if it is unlikely that the fair value of the security will
recover prior to its disposal. Otherwise, non-credit-related other-than-temporary impairments are charged to other comprehensive income, net of tax. We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009. The cumulative effect of applying the
provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

ASC 715 “Compensation - Retirement Benefits”

In December 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 715, to provide guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
postretirement plan. We adopted this standard effective December 31, 2009. This standard expanded our disclosures but had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”

In March 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 815, to provide additional guidance intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging
activities. This standard requires enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2009.
This standard expanded our disclosures but had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ASC 820 “Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures”

In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 820, to provide
additional guidance for estimating fair value but reemphasized that the objective of fair value measurement remained an exit price. This standard provides guidance for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level
of activity in the market and provides factors for companies to consider in identifying transactions that are not orderly. The standard also discusses the necessity of adjustments to transaction or quoted prices to estimate fair

value when it is determined that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity or that the transaction is not orderly. We adopted this standard effective April 1,
2009. This standard expanded our disclosures but did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In August
2009, the FASB issued an update to provide clarification concerning fair value measurements and disclosures for liabilities and, in particular, for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not
available. We adopted this update effective December 31, 2009. The adoption of this update had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In September 2009, the FASB issued an update to permit a reporting entity to measure the fair value of an investment on the basis of net asset value per share if the net asset value is calculated in a
manner consistent with the measurement principles of U.S. GAAP for investment companies. This update also requires disclosures by major category of investments about the attributes of investments, such as the nature of any restrictions on the
investor’s ability to redeem its investments, any unfunded commitments, and the investment strategies of the investees. We adopted this update effective December 31, 2009. The adoption of this update had no effect on our financial position
or results of operations.

ASC 825 “Financial Instruments”

In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 825, which requires companies to disclose the fair value of certain financial instruments in interim financial statements.
This standard also requires companies to disclose the method or methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments and to discuss changes, if any, in those methods or assumptions during the period. We
adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009. This standard expanded our disclosures but had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ASC 855 “Subsequent Events”

In May 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting
standard, now included in ASC 855, to provide subsequent events guidance. This topic was previously addressed only in the auditing literature, and is largely similar to the auditing guidance with limited exceptions which are not intended to result
in significant changes in practice. We adopted this standard effective June 30, 2009. The FASB issued an update in February 2010 to remove the requirement, for certain entities, to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been
evaluated. This standard and update had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Accounting Updates Adopted in 2008:

ASC 325 “Investments - Other”

In January 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 325, to amend the impairment guidance on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by
a transferor in securitized financial assets to achieve more consistent determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. This standard retains and emphasizes the objective of an other-than-temporary impairment assessment and
the related disclosure requirements for certain investments in debt and equity securities. We adopted this standard effective December 31, 2008. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”

In September 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 820, to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair
value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2008. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Accounting Updates Outstanding:

ASC
310 “Receivables”

As previously noted, in July 2010, the FASB issued an update to require additional disclosures regarding the
credit quality of financing receivables. Disclosures around changes in the allowance for credit losses and the reason for those changes are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2011. The
adoption of this update will expand our disclosures for financing receivables, primarily our investments in mortgage loans, but will have no effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ASC 944 “Financial Services - Insurance”

In October 2010, the FASB issued an update which is intended to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts
qualify as deferred acquisition costs. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and permit retrospective application. The guidance in this
update will result in a decrease in the opening balance of our retained earnings if we choose retrospective application on adoption and will result in a decrease in the level of costs we defer subsequent to adoption. Given that application guidance
is still evolving, we have not yet finalized the expected impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Presented as follows are the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments. The carrying values of financial instruments such as short-term investments, cash and bank deposits, accounts and
premiums receivable, and accrued investment income approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. As such, these financial instruments are not included in the following chart.

The methods and assumptions used to
estimate fair values of financial instruments are discussed as follows.



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

Fair Value Measurements for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

Mortgage Loans:

Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered for similar
loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations.

Policy Loans:

Fair values for policy loans, net of reinsurance ceded, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered to policyholders with similar
policies. The carrying amounts of ceded policy loans of $2,790.5 million and $2,675.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are reported on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets and approximate fair value.

Miscellaneous Long-term Investments:

Carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Policyholders’ Funds:

Policyholders’ funds are comprised primarily of deferred annuity products and supplementary contracts without life
contingencies. The carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Fair values for insurance contracts other than investment contracts are not
required to be disclosed. However, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk, which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of
investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

Short-term and Long-term Debt:

Fair values are obtained from
independent pricing services or discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Unfunded Commitments to Investment Partnerships:

Unfunded equity commitments represent legally binding amounts that we have committed to certain investment partnerships, subject to the partnerships
meeting specified conditions. When these conditions are met, we are obligated to invest these amounts in the partnerships. Carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Fair Value Measurements for Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value

We report
fixed maturity securities, derivative financial instruments, and equity securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the
level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment
utilized in measuring fair value. An active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. A quoted
price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair
value using valuation techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet
established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions.

Valuation techniques used for assets and
liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach
converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. The cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset, or the current
replacement cost.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

We use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort. In some cases, a single valuation technique will be appropriate (for example, when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or
liabilities). In other cases, multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate. If we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value, we evaluate and weigh the results, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated
by those results. A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.

The
selection of the valuation method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued. For assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, we generally use valuation techniques
consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. We believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the type of investments we hold. Our fair value
measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs. When markets are less active, brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker. In weighing a broker
quote as an input to fair value, we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions. We also consider the nature of the quote, particularly whether the quote is a binding offer. If prices in an inactive market do
not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets, adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value. When relevant market data is unavailable, which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty, the income approach can, in
suitable circumstances, provide a more appropriate fair value. During 2010, we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end 2009.

We use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments. Inputs that may be used include the following:

•

Broker market maker prices and price levels

•

Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) pricing

•

Prices obtained from external pricing services

•

Benchmark yields (Treasury and interest rate swap curves)

•

Transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

We review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable
market inputs and to verify the validity of a security’s price. The overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a
valid exit price. These adjustments may be made when, in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates, certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be
made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources. These features may include the complexity of the financial instrument, the market in which the financial instrument is traded, counterparty credit risk, credit structure, concentration,
or liquidity. Additionally, an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that
same financial instrument.

The parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and
current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis, as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing. Changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies; rather, the inputs are
modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions.

Fair values for derivatives other than
embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period.
We analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives’ fair values. If
counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the LIBOR-based fair value obtained from our pricing sources, we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources. In regard to
our own credit risk component, we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the LIBOR-based valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an
adequate credit component for our own credit risk.

Fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are
estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangement.

Certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market
liquidity. For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. Additionally, we
may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities. Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates, risk premiums,
performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.

At December 31, 2010, approximately 13.5 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from TRACE pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market
activity in that specific security (comparable to receiving one binding quote). The prices obtained were not adjusted, and the assets were classified as Level 1, the highest category of the three-level fair value hierarchy classification
wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

The remaining 86.5 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on non-binding quotes or
other observable or unobservable inputs, as discussed below.

•

Approximately 69.7 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such
as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques. These assets were classified as Level 2. Level 2 assets or liabilities are those valued using inputs (other than prices included in Level 1) that
are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life.

•

Approximately 5.3 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more non-binding broker price levels, if validated by observable
market data, or on TRACE prices for identical or similar assets absent current market activity. When only one price is available, it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate. These assets, for which we were able to
validate the price using other observable market data, were classified as Level 2.

•

Approximately 11.5 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities, matrix pricing, market models, and/or
internal models or were valued based on non-binding quotes with no other observable market data. These assets were classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market
data. Level 3 is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities
categorized as Level 3 are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.

We consider transactions in inactive or disorderly markets to be less representative of fair value. We use all available observable inputs when measuring
fair value, but when significant other unobservable inputs and adjustments are necessary, we classify these assets or liabilities as Level 3.

Transfers of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 are as follows:

Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 occurred due to the change in availability of either a TRACE or broker market maker
price. Depending on current market conditions, the availability of these Level 1 prices can vary from period to period. For fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of Level 1 or 2, we reflect the
transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the period.

Realized and unrealized investment gains and losses presented in the preceding tables represent gains
and losses only for the time during which the applicable financial instruments were classified as Level 3. The transfers between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of the securities
transferred: (1) transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades, (2) broker/dealer quotes and pricing, primarily related to changes in the level of activity in the market and whether the market was considered orderly, and
(3) comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis. For fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of Level 3, we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the
period. Gains for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 which are included in earnings and are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to assets or liabilities valued using significant unobservable inputs and
still held at each year end were $21.1 million and $243.1 million, respectively. These amounts relate entirely to the changes in fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement which are reported as realized investment

At December 31, 2010, the fair value of investment-grade fixed maturity securities was $37,280.6 million, with a gross
unrealized gain of $3,587.8 million and a gross unrealized loss of $184.9 million. The gross unrealized loss on investment-grade fixed maturity securities was 77.9 percent of the total gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities. Unrealized
losses on investment-grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities.

At December 31, 2010, the fair value of below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities was $2,755.0 million, with a gross unrealized gain of
$138.6 million and a gross unrealized loss of $52.5 million. The gross unrealized loss on below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities was 22.1 percent of the total gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities. Generally,
below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns than investment-grade securities. At December 31, 2010, the unrealized losses in our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities were generally due
to credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and, to a lesser extent, credit concerns related to specific securities. For each specific security in an unrealized loss position, we believe that there are positive factors which mitigate credit
concerns and that the securities for which we have not recorded an other-than-temporary impairment will recover in value.

As of
December 31, 2010, we held 220 individual investment-grade fixed maturity securities and 42 individual below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position, of which 60 investment-grade fixed maturity
securities and 29 below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities had been in an unrealized loss position continuously for over one year.

In
determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, we evaluate the following factors:

•

Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.

•

Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis.

•

Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments.

•

The significance of the decline in value.

•

The time period during which there has been a significant decline in value.

•

Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings.

•

The valuation of the security’s underlying collateral.

Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity.

•

Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments.

•

Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.

•

Any other key measures for the related security.

We evaluate available information, including the factors noted above, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we also consider the strength of the issuer’s balance
sheet, its debt obligations and near term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and
regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the
security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether
impairments are other than temporary. The significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on
these two factors, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.

While determining other-than-temporary
impairments is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The
process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other-than-temporary impairment.

If we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary, the investment is written down to fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period, either in
earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income, as applicable. For those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss for which we have not recognized an other-than-temporary impairment, we believe we will recover the entire
amortized cost, we do not intend to sell the security, and we do not believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. There have been no defaults in the repayment obligations of any
securities for which we have not recorded an other-than-temporary impairment.

Other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity
securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. For
securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the
amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. The determination of cash flows
is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on the circumstances specific to the security. The timing and amount of our cash flow estimates are developed using historical and forecast financial information from the issuer,
including its current and projected liquidity position. We also consider industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, future business prospects and earnings trends, issuer refinancing capabilities, actual and/or potential asset
sales by the issuer, and other data relevant to the collectibility of the contractual cash flows of the security. We take into account the probability of default, expected recoveries, third party guarantees, quality of collateral, and
where

our debt security ranks in terms of subordination. We may use the estimated fair value of collateral as
a proxy for the present value of cash flows if we believe the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of our investment. For fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an other-than-temporary impairment
loss through earnings, if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment
income.

The following table presents the before-tax credit-related portion of other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities
still held as of the dates shown for which a portion of the other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in other comprehensive income.

At December 31, 2010, we had $29.9 million in commitments to fund certain private placement fixed maturity securities.
These commitments are not legally binding and may or may not be funded.

Variable Interest Entities

We invest in variable interests issued by variable interest entities. These investments include tax credit partnerships, private equity partnerships, and
special purpose entities. For those variable interests that are not consolidated in our financial statements, we are not the primary beneficiary because we have neither the power to direct the activities that are most significant to economic
performance nor the responsibility to absorb a majority of the expected losses. The determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is performed at the time of our initial investment and at the date of each subsequent reporting
period.

As of December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our variable interest entity investments that are not consolidated under the
provisions of GAAP was $370.0 million, comprised of $277.2 million of tax credit partnerships and $92.8 million of private equity partnerships. These variable interest entity investments are reported as other long-term investments in our
consolidated balance sheets.

Additionally, we recognize a liability for all legally binding unfunded commitments to these partnerships, with a
corresponding recognition of an invested asset. Our liability for legally binding unfunded commitments to the tax credit partnerships was $169.9 million at December 31, 2010. Contractually, we are a limited partner in these investments,
and our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment. We also had commitments of $73.0 million to fund certain of the private equity partnerships at December 31, 2010. These commitments are not legally
binding and may or may not be funded during the life of the partnerships.

Note 3 - Investments - Continued

We are the sole beneficiary of a special purpose entity which is consolidated under the provisions of
GAAP. This entity is a securitized asset trust containing a highly rated bond for principal protection, nonredeemable preferred stock, and several partnership equity investments. We contributed the bond and partnership investments into the
trust at the time it was established. The trust supports our investment objectives and allows us to maintain our investment in the partnerships while at the same time protecting the principal of the investment. There are no restrictions on
the assets held in this trust, and the trust is free to dispose of the assets at any time. Because the assets in the trust are not liquid investments, we periodically provide funding to the underlying partnerships in the trust upon satisfaction
of contractual notice from the partnerships. The fair values of the bond, nonredeemable preferred stock, and partnerships were $102.2 million, $0.1 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The bonds are
reported as fixed maturity securities, and the nonredeemable preferred stock and partnerships are reported as other long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2010, we had commitments to fund approximately $1.9
million to the underlying partnerships. These commitments are not legally binding and may or may not be funded during the life of the partnerships. The amount of funding provided to the partnerships was de minimis in 2010, 2009, and
2008.

We previously were the sole beneficiary of a special purpose entity that was a securitized asset trust holding forward contracts to
purchase unrelated equity securities. The trust also held a defeasance swap contract for highly rated bonds to provide principal protection for the investments. There were no restrictions on the assets held in this trust, and the trust was free to
dispose of the assets at any time. Because we intended to sell the investment, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $23.7 million during the third quarter of 2009 and subsequently sold the investment in the following quarter for
a realized investment gain of $2.1 million.

Mortgage Loans

Our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. All of our mortgage loans are collateralized by commercial real estate. When
issuing a new loan, our general policy is not to exceed a loan-to-value ratio, or the ratio of the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, of 75 percent. We update the loan-to-value ratios at least every three years
for each loan, and properties undergo a general inspection at least every two years. Our general policy for newly issued loans is to have a debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.25 times on a normalized 25 year amortization period. We update
our debt service coverage ratios annually.

Mortgage loans by property type and geographic region are as follows:

We evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal credit quality rating based on a
comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan. The factors we use to derive our internal credit ratings may include the following:

•

Loan-to-value ratio

•

Debt service coverage ratio based on current operating income

•

Property location, including regional economics, trends and demographics

•

Age, condition, and construction quality of property

•

Current and historical occupancy of property

•

Lease terms relative to market

•

Tenant size and financial strength

•

Borrower’s financial strength

•

Borrower’s equity in transaction

•

Additional collateral, if any

Note 3 - Investments - Continued

Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, loan-to-value and debt
service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining whether we will initially issue the loan and also in assigning values and determining impairment. We assign an overall rating to each loan using an internal rating scale of Aa
(highest quality) to Ba (lowest quality). We review and adjust, as needed, our internal credit quality ratings on an annual basis. This review process is performed more frequently for mortgage loans deemed to have a higher risk of delinquency.

Mortgage loans, sorted by the applicable credit quality indicators, are as follows:

Based on an analysis of the above risk factors, as well as other current information, if we determine that it is probable we
will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the mortgage loan, we establish an allowance for credit loss. If we expect to foreclose on the property, the amount of the allowance typically equals the excess carrying
value of the mortgage loan over the fair value of the underlying collateral. If we expect to retain the mortgage loan until payoff, the allowance equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the expected future cash flows of the loan.
The projection of future cash flows or a determination that the borrower can make the contractual payments is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on the circumstances specific to the loan. Additions and reductions to our
allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans are reported as a component of net realized investment gains and losses. There have been no changes to our accounting policies or methodology from the prior period regarding estimating the allowance for
credit losses on our mortgage loans.

The activity in the allowance for credit losses is as follows:

There was no valuation allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2008 and no activity in the allowance during 2008.

Impaired mortgage loans are as follows:

During 2010, no interest income was recognized on mortgage loans subsequent to impairment.

As of December 31, 2010, none of our commercial mortgage loans were past due regarding principal and interest payments and none were on nonaccrual
status.

At December 31, 2010, we had $42.9 million in commitments to fund certain mortgage loans. These commitments are not legally
binding and may or may not be funded.

Transfers of Financial Assets

To manage our cash position more efficiently, we enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of
invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments. Our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than 30 days. We post collateral
through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later, specified date. The fair value of collateral posted is generally 102 percent of the cash
received.

Our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term
securities lending transactions. These transactions increase our investment income with minimal risk. Our securities lending policy requires that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned be

maintained as collateral. Generally, cash is received as collateral under these agreements. In the event that securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them.

We account for all of our securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as collateralized financings. We had no securities
lending transactions or repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2010.

Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments

Purpose of Derivatives

We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing
business operations. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk, risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities, and foreign currency risk. Historically, we have utilized current and forward
interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps, current and forward currency swaps, forward treasury locks, currency forward contracts, and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities. Hedging transactions are primarily
associated with our individual and group long-term care and individual and group disability products. All other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes.

Our cash flow hedging programs are as follows:

•

Interest rate swaps

are used to hedge interest rate risks and to improve the matching of assets and liabilities. An interest rate swap is an
agreement in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts. The purpose of these swaps is to hedge the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities
thereby protecting us from the potential adverse impact of declining interest rates on the associated policy reserves. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the potential adverse impact of rising interest rates in anticipation of issuing fixed
rate long-term debt.

•

Foreign currency interest rate swaps

have historically been used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed
maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification and to hedge the currency risk associated with certain of the interest payments and debt repayments of the U.S. dollar-denominated debt issued by one of our U.K. subsidiaries. For hedges of
fixed maturity securities, we agree to pay, at specified intervals, fixed rate foreign currency-denominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment. For hedges of debt
issued, we agree to pay, at specified intervals, fixed rate foreign currency-denominated principal and interest payments to the counterparty in exchange for fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated interest payments.

•

Options on forward interest rate swaps

are used to hedge the interest rate risk on certain insurance liabilities with minimum interest rate
guarantees. By purchasing options on interest rate swaps, we are able to lock in the minimum investment yields needed to meet the required interest rate guarantee on the insurance liabilities.

•

Forward treasury locks

are used to minimize interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase or disposal of fixed maturity
securities. A forward treasury lock is a derivative contract without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to purchase or sell a specific U.S. Treasury bond at a future date at a pre-determined price.

•

Foreign currency forward contracts

are used to minimize foreign currency risks. A foreign currency forward is a derivative without an initial
investment where we and the counterparty agree to exchange a specific amount of currencies, at a specific exchange rate, on a specific date. We use these forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the debt
repayments of the U.S. dollar-denominated debt issued by one of our U.K. subsidiaries and to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities owned for diversification purposes.

Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued

Our fair value hedging programs are as follows:

•

Interest rate swaps

are used to effectively convert certain of our fixed rate securities into floating rate securities which are used to fund
our floating rate long-term debt. Under these swap agreements, we receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. Additionally, we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert certain fixed rate long-term debt into floating
rate long-term debt. Under these swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest.

Derivative Risks

The basic
types of risks associated with derivatives are market risk (that the value of the derivative will be adversely impacted by changes in the market, primarily the change in interest and exchange rates) and credit risk (that the counterparty will not
perform according to the terms of the contract). The market risk of the derivatives should generally offset the market risk associated with the hedged financial instrument or liability.

To help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss
position. We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives. These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable
collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount. Our current credit exposure on derivatives, which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral
held, was $14.8 million at December 31, 2010. We held cash collateral of $39.1 million and $24.9 million from our counterparties as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This unrestricted cash collateral is included in short-term
investments and the associated obligation to return the collateral to our counterparties is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We post either fixed maturity securities or cash as collateral to our counterparties. The
carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was $158.8 million and $123.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. No cash was posted as collateral to our counterparties as of
December 31, 2010 or 2009.

The majority of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain specified issuer
credit ratings and financial strength ratings. Should our ratings fall below these specified levels, we would be in violation of the provisions, and our derivatives counterparties could terminate our contracts and request immediate payment. The
aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $199.6 million and $144.6 million, respectively.

During 2008, we terminated certain of our outstanding derivatives when the credit ratings of the counterparty fell below our internal investment policy
guidelines. At the time of termination, the contracts were in a loss position of $39.1 million. Consistent with our collateralization agreement, we had previously posted securities as collateral. During 2009, after further discussion with the
counterparty it was determined that we would not receive the value of our collateral or pay the termination amount due to the counterparty. As a result, we were relieved of our previous liability and recorded a net realized investment loss of $2.3
million on the disposal of the securities posted as collateral.

Hedging Activity

The table below summarizes by notional amounts the activity for each category of derivatives.

The following table summarizes the timing of anticipated settlements of interest rate swaps outstanding under our cash flow
hedging programs at December 31, 2010, whereby we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate. The weighted average variable interest rates assume current market conditions.

Cash Flow Hedges

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $540.0 million and $780.0 million, respectively, notional amount of forward starting
interest rate swaps to hedge the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $617.9
million and $666.7 million, respectively, notional amount of open current and forward foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge fixed income foreign dollar-denominated securities.

During 2010, we entered into $250.0 million notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with
the anticipated issuance of long-term debt. The swaps were terminated in 2010 at the time the debt was issued. We recognized a loss of $18.5 million on the termination of these hedges. This loss was recognized in other comprehensive income and will
be amortized into earnings as a component of interest and debt expense, which will have the effect of increasing the periodic interest expense on our debt issued in 2010.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued

During 2010, we entered into $115.6 million notional amount of forward treasury locks used to minimize
interest rate risk associated with the anticipated disposal of certain fixed maturity securities. The treasury locks were terminated in 2010 at the time the securities were called and/or sold. We recognized a loss of $1.0 million on the termination
of these hedges. This loss was recognized as a component of net realized investment gain or loss or of net investment income.

During 2009, we
terminated certain currency swaps and forward currency contracts used to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with the U.S. dollar-denominated debt issued by one of our U.K. subsidiaries due in part to the improbability of the original
forecasted transactions occurring during the time period originally anticipated and also to reduce our counterparty exposure for those transactions still anticipated to occur as originally forecasted. We recognized a gain of $56.3 million on the
termination of these hedges, $42.0 million of which was recognized in other comprehensive income and $14.3 million as a component of net realized investment gain or loss. The debt associated with this hedge continues to be outstanding as of
December 31, 2010.

We previously owned certain principal protected equity linked trust certificates that contained an embedded
derivative with a notional amount of $50.0 million as of December 31, 2008. This embedded derivative represented forward contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges. The purpose of these forward contracts was to hedge the risk of
changes in cash flows related to the anticipated purchase of certain equity securities. The equity linked trust certificates were subsequently sold in 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, there was no material ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we reclassified $12.3 million of net gains into
earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to the improbability of the original forecasted transactions occurring during the time period originally anticipated. During 2010 and 2009, no component of the derivative
instruments’ gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

As of December 31, 2010, we expect to amortize
approximately $30.0 million of net deferred gains on derivative instruments during the next twelve months. This amount will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item
as the hedged item. The income statement line items that will be affected by this amortization are net investment income and interest and debt expense. The estimated amortization includes the impact of certain derivative contracts that have not yet
been terminated as of December 31, 2010. Fluctuations in fair values of these derivatives between December 31, 2010 and the date of termination will vary our projected amortization. Amounts that will be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income into earnings to offset the earnings impact of foreign currency translation of hedged items are not estimable.

As of
December 31, 2010, we are hedging the variability of future cash flows associated with forecasted transactions through the year 2038.

Fair Value Hedges

As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $174.0 million notional amount of receive variable, pay fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in fair value of certain fixed rate securities held. These swaps effectively convert the associated fixed
rate securities into floating rate securities, which are used to fund our floating rate long-term debt. Changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized
in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the change in fair value of the hedged fixed maturity securities
attributable to the hedged benchmark interest rate resulted in a gain (loss) of $7.7 million and $(15.3) million, respectively, with an offsetting gain or loss on the related interest rate swaps.

Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued

During 2010, we entered into a $350.0 million notional amount receive fixed, pay variable interest rate
swap to hedge the changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate long-term debt. This swap effectively converts the associated fixed rate long-term debt into floating rate debt and provides for a better matching of interest rates with our
short-term investments, which have frequent interest rate resets similar to a floating rate security. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the change in fair value of the hedged fixed debt attributable to the hedged benchmark interest rate
resulted in a gain $14.4 million, with an offsetting loss on the related interest rate swaps.

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and
2009, there was no material ineffectiveness related to our fair value hedges, and no component of the derivative instruments’ gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. There were no instances wherein we discontinued
fair value hedge accounting due to a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying as a fair value hedge.

Derivatives Not Designated as
Hedging Instruments

We have an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement for which we include in our realized
investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us. However, neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in
extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision, delinquency proceedings, or other direct regulatory action. Cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance
contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract. There are no credit-related counterparty triggers, and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down.

Note 5 - Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses - Continued

“Incurred Related to Prior Years - All Other Incurred” declined in 2010 relative to the prior
two years. The decrease relates primarily to an increased rate of claim recoveries for our group long-term disability and individual disability - recently issued lines of business in Unum US. Claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational
and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time. Throughout the period 2008 to 2010, we had generally stable to improving claims management performance, and our claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly
favorable to our long-term assumptions. Our claims management performance during 2010 for Unum US group long-term disability exceeded our long-term assumptions in regard to claim resolution rates. For the Unum US individual disability - recently
issued line of business and the Individual Disability - Closed Block segment, the claims management performance in 2010 remained stable relative to 2009. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the
resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably.

A reconciliation of policy and contract benefits and reserves for future policy and contract benefits as reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment
expenses is as follows:

The unrealized adjustment to reserves for future policy and contract benefits reflects the changes that would be necessary
to policyholder liabilities if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the available-for-sale securities had been realized. Changes in these adjustments are reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss.

The income tax rate in the U.K. will be reduced from 28 percent to 27 percent in April 2011. We are
required to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities through income on the date of enactment of a rate change. We recorded a reduction of $2.7 million to our income tax expense in the third quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the rate
change on our net deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations. We consider the unremitted earnings of our foreign operations to be permanently invested. The determination of a tax liability related to these earnings is not
practicable.

Our consolidated statements of income include the following changes in unrecognized tax benefits:

Included in the balances at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are $123.7 million, $131.6 million, and $134.6 million,
respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Other than potential interest and penalties, the
disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect our results of operations but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

We recognize interest expense and penalties, if applicable, related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense net of federal income tax. The total amounts of accrued interest and penalties in our
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are $25.4 million, $19.9 million, and $13.4 million, respectively. We recognized interest related to unrecognized tax expense in our consolidated statements of income of $5.5
million, $6.5 million, and $5.9 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. There were no changes to our uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements or lapses in statutes of limitations during 2010, 2009, and 2008.

We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We are under continuous examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) with regard to our U.S. federal income tax returns. During 2010, the IRS completed its examination of tax years 2005 and 2006 and issued its revenue agent’s report (RAR) in December 2010. In January 2011, we filed a
protest to the RAR with respect to all significant adverse proposed adjustments. During 2008, the IRS completed its examination of tax years 2002 through 2004 and issued its RAR. We filed a protest to the RAR in 2008 with respect to all
significant adverse proposed adjustments.

Note 6 - Income Tax - Continued

During 2009, we had a conference with the IRS with respect to our appeal of IRS audit adjustments for
the years 1999 to 2004. Although we have not yet reached a final settlement with the IRS for these years, it is reasonably possible that this appeal will be resolved in whole or in part within 12 months and that statutes of limitations may expire in
multiple jurisdictions within the same period. As a result, it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within 12 months by $0 to $40.0 million. We believe sufficient provision has been made for all
uncertain tax positions and that any adjustments by tax authorities with respect to such positions would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

Tax years subsequent to 2006 remain subject to examination by tax authorities in the U.S. Tax years subsequent to 2008 remain subject to
examination in major foreign jurisdictions. We believe sufficient provision has been made for all proposed and potential adjustments for years that are not closed by the statute of limitations in all major tax jurisdictions and that any such
adjustments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. However, it is possible that the resolution of income tax matters could produce quarterly volatility in our results of operations in
future periods.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
were signed into law. Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be
tax deductible after 2012. Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted. Our income tax expense for
the year ended December 31, 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change.

Included in 2009 operating results is a refund of interest of $0.3 million before tax and $0.2 million after tax attributable to tax year 1998. Included in 2008 operating results is a refund of interest
of $7.6 million before tax and $4.9 million after tax primarily attributable to tax years 1986 through 1996.

As of December 31, 2010, we
had no net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. We held a valuation allowance of $4.1 million related to basis differences in foreign subsidiaries and net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions because, in our judgment, we will
most likely not realize a tax benefit for these amounts. The $0.1 million decrease in the valuation allowance during 2010 is due to the fluctuation in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate.

Total income taxes paid net of refunds during 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $273.0 million, $381.6 million, and $369.0 million, respectively.

Long-term and short-term debt consists of the following:

Collateralized debt, which consists of the senior secured notes, ranks highest in priority, followed by unsecured notes,
which consists of notes and medium-term notes, followed by junior subordinated debt securities. The junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 are callable under limited, specified circumstances. The remaining callable debt may be redeemed, in
whole or in part, at any time.

The aggregate contractual principal maturities are $225.1 million in 2011, $296.9 million in 2015, and
$2,349.5 million in 2016 and thereafter.

Senior Secured Notes

In 2007, Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unum Group, issued $800.0 million of insured, senior, secured notes due 2037 (the Northwind notes) in a private
offering. The Northwind notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.78%.

Northwind Holdings’ ability to
meet its obligations to pay principal, interest, and other amounts due on the Northwind notes will be dependent principally on its receipt of dividends from Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re), the sole subsidiary of Northwind Holdings.
Northwind Re reinsured the risks attributable to specified individual disability insurance policies issued by or reinsured by Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum America), and The Paul Revere
Life Insurance Company (collectively, the ceding insurers) pursuant to separate reinsurance agreements between Northwind Re and each of the ceding insurers. The ability of Northwind Re to pay dividends to Northwind Holdings will depend on its
satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and the performance of the reinsured policies.

Recourse for the payment of principal, interest, and other amounts due on the Northwind notes is limited
to the collateral for the Northwind notes and the other assets, if any, of Northwind Holdings. The collateral consists of a first priority, perfected security interest in (a) the debt service coverage account (Northwind DSCA) that Northwind
Holdings is required to maintain in accordance with the indenture pursuant to which the Northwind notes were issued (the Northwind indenture), (b) the capital stock of Northwind Re and the dividends and distributions on such capital stock, and
(c) Northwind Holdings’ rights under the transaction documents related to the Northwind notes to which Northwind Holdings is a party. At December 31, 2010 the amount in the Northwind DSCA was $9.0 million. None of Unum Group, the
ceding insurers, Northwind Re, or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor with respect to the Northwind notes.

Northwind Holdings is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal under the Northwind notes at par on the quarterly scheduled payment dates
under the Northwind notes in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) a targeted amortization amount as defined in the Northwind indenture and (ii) the amount of the remaining available funds in the Northwind DSCA minus an amount equal to the
minimum balance that is required to be maintained in the Northwind DSCA under the Northwind indenture, provided that Northwind Holdings has sufficient funds available to pay its other expenses, including interest payments on the Northwind notes, and
to maintain the minimum balance in the Northwind DSCA as required under the Northwind indenture. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, Northwind Holdings made principal payments of $58.3 million, $48.0 million and $59.3 million, respectively, on the
Northwind notes.

In 2006, Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind Holdings), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unum Group, issued $130.0 million of
insured, senior, secured notes due 2036 (the Tailwind notes) in a private offering. The Tailwind notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.35%.

Tailwind Holdings’ ability to meet its obligations to pay principal, interest, and other amounts due on the Tailwind notes will be dependent principally on its receipt of dividends from Tailwind
Reinsurance Company (Tailwind Re), the sole subsidiary of Tailwind Holdings. Tailwind Re reinsured Unum America’s liability with respect to certain specified long-term disability claims incurred between January 1, 1999 and
December 31, 2001 that were in payment status on January 1, 2006 pursuant to a reinsurance agreement between Tailwind Re and Unum America. The ability of Tailwind Re to pay dividends to Tailwind Holdings will depend on its satisfaction of
applicable regulatory requirements and the performance of the reinsured claims.

Recourse for the payment of principal, interest, and other
amounts due on the Tailwind notes is limited to the collateral for the Tailwind notes and the other assets, if any, of Tailwind Holdings. The collateral consists of a first priority, perfected security interest in (a) the debt service coverage
account (Tailwind DSCA) that Tailwind Re is required to maintain in accordance with the indenture pursuant to which the Tailwind notes were issued (the Tailwind indenture), (b) the capital stock of Tailwind Re and the dividends and
distributions on such capital stock, and (c) Tailwind Holdings’ rights under the transaction documents related to the Tailwind notes to which Tailwind Holdings is a party. At December 31, 2010 the amount in the Tailwind DSCA was $12.0
million. None of Unum Group, Unum America, Tailwind Re, or any other affiliate of Tailwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor with respect to the Tailwind notes.

Tailwind Holdings is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal under the Tailwind notes at par on the quarterly scheduled payment dates under the Tailwind notes in an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) a targeted amortization amount as defined in the Tailwind indenture and (ii) the amount of the remaining available funds in the Tailwind DSCA minus an amount equal to the minimum balance that is required to be maintained in
the Tailwind DSCA under the Tailwind indenture, provided that Tailwind Holdings has sufficient funds available to pay its other expenses, including interest payments on the Tailwind notes, and to maintain the minimum balance in the Tailwind DSCA as
required under the Tailwind indenture. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, Tailwind Holdings made principal payments of $10.0 million each year on the Tailwind notes.

Unsecured Notes

In September 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. In 2010, we purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.

In 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. In 2009, we purchased and retired $1.2 million aggregate principal of
our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028 and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028.

In 2008, $36.6 million of the 6.85%
senior debentures due 2015 were redeemed. These debentures were issued by UnumProvident Finance Company plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unum Group, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Unum Group.

Fair Value Hedge

During 2010,
we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% unsecured senior notes into floating rate debt. Under this agreement, we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable
rate of interest, based off of three-month LIBOR. The fair value adjustment of the swap resulted in a reduction of the carrying amount of the hedged debt of $14.4 million at December 31, 2010.

Junior Subordinated Debt Securities

In 1998, Provident Financing Trust I (the trust) issued $300.0 million of 7.405% capital securities in a public offering. These capital securities, which mature in 2038, are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by Unum Group, have a liquidation value of $1,000 per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances. Unum Group issued 7.405% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to the trust in
connection with the capital securities offering. The debentures mature in 2038. The sole assets of the trust are the junior subordinated debt securities.

Short-term Debt

In 2009, we purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of
our outstanding 5.859% notes and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008. In 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes and $175.0 million of our 5.997% notes.

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest paid on long-term and short-term debt and related securities during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $140.7 million, $122.0 million, and $157.3 million, respectively.

Shelf Registration

We have a
shelf registration, which became effective in December 2008, with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase contracts,
units and warrants, or preferred securities of wholly-owned finance trusts. The shelf registration enables us to raise funds from the offering of any individual security covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof,
subject to market conditions and our capital needs.

Plan Assets

The objective of our pension and OPEB plans is to maximize long-term return, within acceptable risk levels, in a manner that is consistent with the fiduciary standards of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA), while maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and expenses.

Assets for our U.S. pension plans include
a diversified blend of domestic and international large cap, mid cap, and small cap equity securities, U.S. government and agencies, and corporate fixed income securities, private equity funds of funds, hedge funds of funds, and cash equivalents.
The large cap and mid cap equity securities are comprised of equity index funds that are designed to track the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 and S&P 400 Mid Cap indices, respectively. Small cap equity securities consist of
individual equity securities as well as index funds that track the Russell 2000 index. International equity investments and emerging market equity investments consist of equity index funds that track the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
Europe Australasia Far East Index and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, respectively. U.S. government and agency securities are comprised of treasury bonds and U.S. agency asset-backed securities. Corporate fixed income securities consist of
investment-grade and below-investment-grade corporate bonds as well as certain asset-backed securities. Alternative investments, which include private equity funds of funds and hedge funds of funds, utilize proprietary strategies that tend to have a
low correlation to the U.S. stock market. The target allocations for invested assets are 60 percent equity securities, 30 percent fixed income securities, and 10 percent alternative investments. Prohibited investments include, but are not limited
to, unlisted securities, futures contracts, options, short sales, and investments in securities issued by the Company or its affiliates.

Assets for our U.K. pension plan are primarily invested in a pooled fund consisting of diversified growth assets. The remaining assets in the U.K. plan
are invested in a fixed-interest U.K. corporate bond fund and an index-linked U.K. government bond fund. The diversified growth fund is designed to generate a return that matches the U.K. Retail Price Index plus five percent over a five to seven
year period. This fund is comprised primarily of domestic (U.K.) and international equity securities, emerging market fixed income securities, and a blend of investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed income securities. Investment in
fixed-interest U.K. corporate bonds is achieved through the ownership of a fund that primarily invests in corporate bonds with maturity dates greater than 10 years. Investment in U.K. index-linked bonds is achieved through ownership of a fund that
traces the Financial Times Stock Exchange 5 year Index-linked Index. The target allocation for the assets is 60 percent equity securities and 40 percent fixed income securities. There are no categories of investments that are specifically prohibited
by the U.K. plan, but there are general guidelines that ensure prudent investment action is taken. Such guidelines include the prevention of the plan from using derivatives for speculative purposes and limiting the concentration of risk in any one
type of investment.

Assets for life insurance benefits payable to certain former retirees covered under the OPEB plan are invested in life
insurance contracts issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. The terms of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with those the subsidiary offers to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated. There are no categories of
investments specifically prohibited by the OPEB plan.

We believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector,
with no potential risk concentrations in any one category.

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 8 - Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits - Continued

Level 1 equity and fixed income securities consist of individual holdings and funds that are valued based on unadjusted
quoted prices from active markets for identical securities. Level 2 equity securities consist of funds that are valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying holdings. These investments have no unfunded commitments and no specific
redemption restrictions. Level 2 fixed income securities are valued using observable inputs through market corroborated pricing.

Alternative
investments are valued based on the NAV of the underlying holdings in a period ranging from one month to one quarter in arrears. We evaluate the need for adjustments to the NAV based on market conditions and discussions with fund managers in the
period subsequent to the valuation date and prior to issuance of the financial statements. We made no adjustments to the NAV for 2010 or 2009. The hedge funds of funds have no redemption restrictions. The private equity funds of funds cannot be
redeemed by investors, and distributions are received following the maturity of the underlying assets. It is estimated that these underlying assets will begin to mature between five and eight years from the date of initial investment.

Measurement Assumptions

We use a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans. The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of our benefit obligations as of December 31 and our net periodic benefit
costs for the years ended December 31 are as follows:



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 8 - Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits - Continued

We set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement-related benefit plans at the
measurement date to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the projected cash flows for future benefits.

Our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is an estimate, based on statistical analysis, of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the plan assets until current benefits
are paid. The market-related value equals the fair value of assets, determined as of the measurement date. Our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories were based on a combination of historical market performance
and evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists.

The methodology underlying the return assumption
included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long-term rates of return, volatility of returns, and the correlation of returns between various asset classes. The expected return for the total portfolio was
calculated based on the plan’s strategic asset allocation. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio
reviews. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.

The expected return assumption for the life insurance reserve for our OPEB plan at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was 5.75 percent, which was based on
full investment in fixed income securities with an average book yield of 6.21 percent in 2010 and 2009.

Our rate of compensation increase
assumption is generally based on periodic studies of compensation trends.

For measurement purposes at December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health care benefits assumed for the next calendar year was 9.00 percent for benefits payable to both retirees prior to Medicare eligibility as well as Medicare eligible
retirees. The rate was assumed to change gradually to 5.00 percent by the end of 2019 and remain at that level thereafter.

The medical and
dental premium used to determine the per retiree employer subsidy are capped. If the cap is not reached by the year 2015, the caps are then set equal to the year 2015 premium. Certain of the current retirees and all future retirees are subject to
the cap.

Note 8 - Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits - Continued

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

The following table provides the components of the net periodic benefit cost for the plans described above for the years ended December 31.

A one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate at December 31, 2010 would have increased
(decreased) the service cost and interest cost by $0.3 million and $(0.2) million, respectively, and the postretirement benefit obligation by $3.4 million and $(2.7) million, respectively.

Our OPEB plan currently receives a subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act). This act allows an employer to
choose whether to coordinate prescription drug benefits under a retiree medical plan with the Medicare prescription drug benefit or to keep the company plan design as it is and receive a subsidy from the federal government. When the Medicare Act
became effective in 2006, we initially elected to receive the subsidy from the federal government with plans to defer our coordination with the new prescription drug benefit until a later date. This anticipated change was reflected in the net
periodic benefit cost. In 2009, we amended the plan design to stop the deferral of coordination of benefits and elected to continue receiving the existing subsidy from the federal government. This election resulted in a $4.4 million prior service
credit that began amortization in 2010. We received subsidy payments of $1.4 million and $1.2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our expected benefit payments in future years have been reduced by the amount of subsidy payments we expect to
receive.

The unrecognized net actuarial loss, prior service credit, and transition asset included in accumulated other comprehensive income
and expected to be amortized and included in net periodic pension cost during 2011 is $31.4 million before tax and $20.4 million after tax. The prior service credit expected to be amortized and included as a reduction to net periodic cost for our
OPEB plan during 2011 is $2.6 million before tax and $1.7 million after tax.

Benefit Payments

The following table provides expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate.

Funding Policy

The funding policy for our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan is to contribute annually an amount at least equal to the minimum
annual contribution required under ERISA and other applicable laws, but generally not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. We had no regulatory contribution requirements for 2010 and 2009; however, we
elected to make voluntary contributions of $167.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. We do not anticipate making any additional contributions to our U.S. plans during 2011. The funding policy for our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension
plan is to contribute the amount of the benefit payments made during the year. Our expected return on plan assets and discount rate will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our U.S. pension and OPEB plans because we have met
all minimum funding requirements required under ERISA.

We contribute to our U.K. plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which
requires us to contribute to the plan at the rate of at least 15.0 percent of employee salaries sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under U.K. legislation. We made contributions of $5.0 million and $5.5 million in 2010 and 2009,
respectively, or approximately £3.2 million and £3.5 million. We expect to make contributions of £3.2 million during 2011.

Our OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and
dental benefits. It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan.

Note 9 - Stockholders’ Equity and Earnings Per Common Share

Common Stock

In May 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up
to $500.0 million of Unum Group’s common stock. During 2010, we repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a cost of $356.0 million, including commissions of $0.3 million, under this share repurchase program. The dollar value of shares remaining
under this program, which had an expiration date of May 2011, was $144.3 million at December 31, 2010.

On February 2, 2011, our
board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Unum Group’s common stock, in addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the previous authorization discussed above. The $1.0 billion share repurchase program
has an expiration date of August 2012.

On February 4, 2011, we repurchased 7.1 million shares, at a cost of $200.0 million, using
an accelerated repurchase agreement with a financial counterparty. As part of this transaction, we simultaneously entered into a forward contract indexed to the price of Unum Group common stock, which subjects the transaction to a future price
adjustment. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we may receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount. Any price
adjustment payable to us will be settled in shares of Unum Group common stock. Any price adjustment we are required to pay will be settled in either cash or common stock at our option. We expect the price adjustment to settle on or before the
completion of the accelerated repurchase agreement in April 2011. The shares repurchased pursuant to the accelerated repurchase agreement completed the $500.0 million repurchase authorization and initiated the $1.0 billion repurchase program.

During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Group’s common stock. During 2008, we
repurchased $700.0 million or 29.9 million shares of common stock under this share repurchase program.

The shares repurchased prior to
and through December 31, 2010 will be held in treasury until such time as they may be reissued or retired and are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets. The shares repurchased using the accelerated repurchase agreement
were retired as of February 4, 2011.

Preferred Stock

Unum Group has 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.10 per share. No preferred stock has been issued to date.

Note 9 - Stockholders’ Equity and Earnings Per Common Share - Continued

Earnings Per Common Share

Net income per common share is determined as follows:

We use the treasury stock method to
account for the effect of outstanding stock options, nonvested stock awards, and performance restricted stock units on the computation of dilutive earnings per share. Under this method, these potential common shares will each have a dilutive effect,
as individually measured, when the average market price of Unum Group common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the stock options, the grant price of the nonvested stock awards, and/or the threshold stock price of performance
restricted stock units. For further discussion of stock-based awards see Note 10.

The outstanding stock options have exercise prices ranging
from $11.37 to $32.08, the nonvested stock awards have grant prices ranging from $10.59 to $25.53, and the performance restricted stock units have a threshold stock price of $26.00.

In computing earnings per share assuming dilution, only potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per share) are included. Potential common shares not included in the
computation of dilutive earnings per share because their impact would be antidilutive, based on current market prices, approximated 3.5 million, 7.1 million, and 8.3 million shares of common stock for the years ended December 31,
2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

units, and other stock-based awards. Each full value award, defined as any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, is counted as 2.7 shares.

The exercise price for stock options issued cannot be less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years after the date of
grant and generally vest after three years. At December 31, 2010, approximately 20.48 million shares were available for future grants.

Under the broad-based stock plan of 2001, up to 2.00 million shares of common stock were available for stock option awards to our employees, officers, consultants, and brokers, excluding certain
senior officers and directors. The plan was terminated in December 2007 for purposes of any further grants, other than reload grants, for which 20,000 shares were available at December 31, 2010. The stock options have a maximum term of ten
years after the date of grant and generally vest after three years.

Under the stock plan of 1999, comprised of the Provident Companies, Inc.
stock plan of 1999 and the UnumProvident Corporation stock plan of 1999, an aggregate of up to 17.50 million shares of common stock were available for awards to our employees, officers, brokers, and directors. Awards could be in the form of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, dividend equivalent awards, or any other right or interest relating to stock. The plan was terminated in May 2007 for purposes of any further grants, other than reload grants, for which 250,000
shares were available at December 31, 2010. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years after the date of grant and generally vest after three years.

Substantially all of our employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Under the plan, up to 3.46 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance, of
which approximately 1.08 million remain available for issuance at December 31, 2010. Stock may be purchased at the end of each financial quarter at a purchase price of 85 percent of the market price. We sold 150,879 shares, 232,962 shares,
and 148,490 shares to employees with a weighted average grant date fair value of $3.47, $4.13, and $5.72, during the years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

We issue new shares of common stock for nonvested stock grants, exercise of stock options, and purchase of ESPP shares.

Nonvested Stock Awards

Activity for nonvested stock awards classified as equity is as follows:

Stock awards vest over a one to three year service period, beginning at the date of grant, and the compensation
cost is recognized ratably during the vesting period. Compensation cost for stock awards subject to accelerated vesting upon retirement is recognized over the implicit service period. Forfeitable dividend equivalents on nonvested stock
awards are accrued in the form of additional restricted stock units.

The weighted average grant date fair values per share for nonvested
stock awards granted during 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $20.91, $12.32, and $23.66, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $19.0 million, $17.5 million, and $11.3 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2010, we had $12.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 years.

Cash-Settled Awards

Cash-settled awards vest over a three year service period,
beginning at the date of grant, and the compensation cost is recognized ratably during the vesting period. Compensation cost for stock awards subject to accelerated vesting upon retirement is recognized over the implicit service
period. Forfeitable dividend equivalents on nonvested cash-settled awards are accrued in the form of additional units.

During 2010, we
granted 100,445 units which will be settled in cash ratably over a three year period on the anniversary of the award. The amount payable per unit awarded will be equal to the price per share of Unum Group’s common stock at settlement of the
award, and as such, we measure the value of the award each reporting period based on the current stock price. The effects of changes in the stock price during the service period are recognized as compensation cost over the service period. Changes in
the amount of the liability due to stock price changes after the service period are compensation cost of the period in which the changes occur. The cash-settled awards granted during 2010 had a weighted average grant date fair value per unit of
$20.79. At December 31, 2010, we had 101,695 units outstanding, including dividend equivalent units. There is no unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2010 cash-settled awards, other than future changes in the liability due to future
stock price changes, as the units do not require additional future service.

Performance Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs)

PRSU activity is summarized as follows:

In September 2007, we issued approximately 1.25 million PRSUs with a grant date fair value of $15.99. Vesting
for this grant is contingent upon meeting various company threshold performance and stock price conditions. Forfeitable dividend equivalents on PRSUs are accrued in the form of additional restricted stock units. The weighted average grant date fair
values per share for PRSU grants and dividends during 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $21.44, $15.95, and $19.08, respectively. All PRSUs outstanding at December 31, 2010 were nonvested.

At December 31, 2010, we had $0.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to PRSUs that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.5 years. The PRSU expense and unrecognized
compensation cost assume the performance goals are attained at 100 percent. Actual performance may result in zero to 100 percent of the units ultimately being earned. We use the accelerated method of amortization for recognizing compensation
expense, which treats each of the three vesting tranches as a separate award over the expected life of the unit.

We estimated the fair value
on the date of initial grant using the Monte-Carlo model. The following assumptions were used to value the grant:

•

Expected volatility of 29 percent, based on our historical daily stock prices.

•

Expected life of 4.4 years, which equals the maximum term.

•

Expected dividend yield of 1.24 percent, based on the dividend rate at the date of grant.

•

Risk free interest rate of 3.97 percent, based on the yield of treasury bonds at the date of grant.

Stock Options

Stock option activity is summarized as follows:

All outstanding stock options at
December 31, 2010 are expected to vest. Stock options vest over a three year service period, beginning at the date of grant, and the compensation cost is recognized ratably during the vesting period. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $3.2 million, $2.6 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $2.5 million, $2.0 million, and $0.5 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2010, we had $0.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.7 years.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $9.04, $4.45, and $8.84, respectively. We estimated the fair value on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. The following assumptions were used to value the 2010, 2009, and 2008 grants:

•

Expected volatility of 55 percent, 50 percent, and 43 percent, respectively, based on our historical daily stock prices.

•

Expected life of 5.0 years, based on historical average years to exercise.

•

Expected dividend yield of 1.59 percent, 1.68 percent, and 1.30 percent, respectively, based on the dividend rate at the date of grant.

•

Risk free interest rate of 2.33 percent, 1.89 percent, and 2.93 percent, respectively, based on the yield of treasury bonds at the date of grant.

Expense

Compensation expense for the stock plans, as reported in our consolidated statements of income, is as follows:

Cash received under all share-based payment arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was
$10.0 million, $8.0 million, and $4.4 million, respectively.

Note 11 - Reinsurance

Our reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2010 relates to 93 companies. Fourteen major companies account for approximately 91 percent of our
reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2010, and are all companies rated A or better by A.M. Best Company (AM Best) or are fully securitized by letters of credit or investment-grade fixed maturity securities held in trust. Of the remaining
reinsurance recoverable, approximately eight percent relates to business reinsured either with companies rated A- or better by AM Best, with overseas entities with equivalent ratings or backed by letters of credit or trust agreements, or through
reinsurance arrangements wherein we retain the assets in our general account. Approximately one percent of our reinsurance recoverable is held by companies either rated below A- by AM Best or not rated.

Reinsurance data is as follows:

During 2008, we entered into a
reinsurance arrangement for the ongoing administration and management of a closed block of group long-term disability claims in our Unum UK segment. As a result of the assumption, we received cash of £24.5 million, recorded
£0.4 million in accrued premiums receivable, assumed reserves of £22.2 million (approximately $44.2 million), and recorded a deferred gain of £2.7 million.

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 12 - Segment Information

We have three major business segments: Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial Life. Our other segments are the Individual Disability – Closed Block segment and the Corporate and Other segment.

The Unum US segment includes insurance for group long-term and short-term disability, group life and accidental death and dismemberment, and supplemental
and voluntary lines of business. The supplemental and voluntary lines of business are comprised of recently issued disability insurance, group and individual long-term care insurance, and voluntary benefits products. These products are marketed
through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants.

The Unum UK segment includes insurance
for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business. The supplemental and voluntary lines of business are comprised of individual disability, group and individual critical illness, and voluntary benefits
products. Unum UK’s products are sold primarily in the United Kingdom through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants.

The Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products marketed to employees at the workplace through an
agency sales force and brokers.

The Individual Disability – Closed Block segment generally consists of those individual disability
policies in-force before the substantial changes in product offerings, pricing, distribution, and underwriting, which generally occurred during the period 1994 through 1998. A small amount of new business continued to be sold after these changes,
but we stopped selling new policies in this segment at the beginning of 2004 other than update features contractually allowable on existing policies.

The Corporate and Other segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and
certain other corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business. Corporate and Other also includes results from certain Unum US insurance products not actively marketed, including individual life and corporate-owned life insurance,
reinsurance pools and management operations, group pension, health insurance, and individual annuities.

In the following segment financial
data, “operating revenue” excludes net realized investment gains and losses. “Operating income” or “operating loss” excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax. These are considered non-GAAP
financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures of “operating revenue” and “operating income” or “operating loss” differ from revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of
income prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of before-tax realized investment gains and losses. We measure segment performance excluding realized investment gains and losses because we believe that this performance measure is a
better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses, and a
long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business.

Note 12 - Segment Information - Continued

Realized investment gains and losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to
decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. However, income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of overall profitability. We may experience realized investment
losses, which will affect future earnings levels since our underlying business is long-term in nature and we need to earn the assumed interest rates in our liabilities.

We report goodwill in our Unum US segment and in our Unum UK segment, which are the segments expected to
benefit from the originating business combinations. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, goodwill was $201.2 million and $201.6 million, respectively, with $190.0 million attributable to Unum US and the remainder attributable to Unum UK. The decrease
during 2010 is due entirely to the fluctuation in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate.

Stockholders’ equity is allocated
to the operating segments on the basis of an internal allocation formula that reflects the volume and risk components of each operating segment’s business and aligns allocated equity with our target capital levels for regulatory and rating
agency purposes. We modify this formula periodically to recognize changes in the views of capital requirements.

Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Commitments

We
have noncancelable lease obligations on certain office space and equipment. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate net minimum lease payments were $220.1 million payable as follows: $25.8 million in 2011, $25.1 million in 2012, $22.9 million in
2013, $19.8 million in 2014, $15.6 million in 2015, and $110.9 million thereafter. Rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $29.3 million, $30.1 million, and $34.5 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, we had unfunded commitments of $73.0 million for certain of our private equity partnerships, $1.9 million for underlying
partnerships in our investment in a special purpose entity, $29.9 million for certain private placement fixed maturity securities, and $42.9 million for certain mortgage loans. The funds are not legally binding at December 31, 2010 and may
or may not be funded during the term of the investments. In addition, we have a legally binding unfunded commitment of $169.9 million, which is recognized as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets, to fund tax credit partnership investments.

Contingent Liabilities

We are a defendant in a number of litigation matters. In some of these matters, no specified amount is sought. In others, very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are
asserted. There is a wide variation of pleading practice permitted in the United States courts with respect to requests for monetary damages, including some courts in which no specified amount is required and others which allow the plaintiff to
state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that court. Further, some jurisdictions permit plaintiffs to allege damages well in excess of reasonably possible verdicts. Based on our extensive experience and that of
others in the industry with respect to litigating or resolving claims through settlement over an extended period of time, we believe that the monetary damages asserted in a lawsuit or claim bear little relation to the merits of
the case, or the likely disposition value. Therefore, the specific monetary relief sought is not stated.

Unless indicated otherwise in the
descriptions below, reserves have not been established for litigation and contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

In the disclosures that follow about litigation, we refer to the name of the company specified in the original complaint, following the practice in the
courts. Therefore, references to UnumProvident Corporation should be understood as references to Unum Group.

Claims Handling Matters

We and our insurance subsidiaries, as part of our normal operations in managing disability claims, are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits.
Most typically these lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder, and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims. For our general claim
litigation, we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course. We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to general claim litigation, after consideration of the reserves maintained,
will not be material to our consolidated financial condition. Nevertheless, given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages could, from time to time,
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a period, depending on the results of operations for the particular period.

From time to time class action allegations are pursued where the claimant or policyholder purports to represent a larger number of individuals who are similarly situated. Since each insurance claim is
evaluated based on its own merits, there is rarely a single act or series of actions, which can properly be addressed by a class action. Nevertheless, we monitor these cases closely and defend ourselves appropriately where these allegations are
made.

Broker Compensation, Quoting Process, and Other Matters

Examinations and Investigations

In November 2009, we were contacted by Florida state insurance regulators to discuss a resolution of their investigation of our compliance with state and federal laws with respect to producer
compensation, solicitation activities, policies sold to state or municipal entities, and information regarding compensation arrangements with brokers. This investigation commenced in 2005, and, until this most recent contact, we had received no
communications from the regulators regarding this matter since December 2007.

Broker-Related Litigation

We and certain of our subsidiaries, along with many other insurance brokers and insurers, have been named as defendants in a series of putative
class actions that have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings as part of multidistrict litigation (MDL) No. 1663,

In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust
Litigation

. The plaintiffs in MDL No. 1663 filed a consolidated amended complaint in August 2005, which alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated federal and state antitrust laws, the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), ERISA, and various state common law requirements by engaging in alleged bid rigging and customer allocation and by paying undisclosed compensation to insurance brokers to steer business to defendant insurers. Defendants
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 29, 2005. On April 5, 2007, defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice as to all counts except the ERISA counts. Plaintiffs were granted a last opportunity to file
an amended complaint, and they did so on May 22, 2007.

On August 31, 2007 and September 28, 2007, plaintiffs’
federal antitrust and RICO claims were dismissed with prejudice. Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the ERISA counts was granted on January 14, 2008. All pending state law claims were dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiffs filed
an appeal with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals of the order dismissing their federal antitrust and RICO claims. On August 16, 2010, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal with prejudice of plaintiff’s federal
antitrust and RICO claims against us and certain of our subsidiaries. On September 27, 2010, the District Court entered final judgment against plaintiffs and in favor of defendants, including us and certain of our subsidiaries.

We are a defendant in an action styled,

Palm Tree Computers Systems, Inc. v. ACE USA, et
al.

, which was filed in the Florida state Circuit Court on February 16, 2005. The complaint contains allegations similar to those made in the multidistrict litigation referred to above. The case was removed to federal court and, on
October 20, 2005, the case was transferred to the District of New Jersey multidistrict litigation. Plaintiffs renewed a motion to remand the case to the state court in Florida, and that motion was denied without prejudice.

Miscellaneous Matters

In September
2003,

United States of America ex. rel. Patrick J. Loughren v. UnumProvident Corporation and GENEX Services, Inc.

(GENEX) was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. This is a qui tam action to recover
damages and civil penalties on behalf of the United States of America alleging violations of the False Claims Act by us and our former GENEX subsidiary. In accordance with the False Claims Act, the action was originally filed under seal to provide
the government the opportunity to investigate the allegations and prosecute the action if they believed that the case had merit and warranted their attention. The government declined to prosecute the case, and the case became a matter of public
record on December 23, 2004. The complaint alleged that we defrauded the government by inducing and or assisting disability claimants to apply for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) when we allegedly knew that the
claimants were not disabled under SSA criteria. Relator identified 95 individual claims that he alleged to be false and sought to present expert testimony from a statistician who would say that each of those claims found to be false could be
extrapolated to support a finding of a much larger number of false claims. We filed a motion for summary judgment which was denied on September 15, 2008. The case proceeded to trial at which seven out of the 95 claims were adjudicated.
We prevailed on four of the claims, the Relator prevailed on two of the claims, and the jury could not reach a verdict on one of the claims. The jury awarded the Relator $850 in damages which was trebled. The court also assessed a penalty
of $11,000 for each of the two claims. On February 24, 2009, the court also ruled that the testimony of the Relator’s expert in support of extrapolation would be excluded. We filed an appeal with the First Circuit Court of Appeals on the
two claims which Relator prevailed. On July 29, 2010, the Court of Appeals vacated the jury verdict on the two claims and remanded the case to the trial court. On August 12, 2010, we filed a petition with the First Circuit Court of Appeals
seeking clarification and/or rehearing en banc of the court’s July 29, 2010 opinion. On October 7, 2010, this petition was denied without comment and the case was remanded back to the trial court. An estimate of the liability to
resolve this matter was established in the fourth quarter of 2010. This accrual was not material to our operating results.

In
September 2008, we received service of a complaint, in an adversary proceeding in connection with the bankruptcy case

In re Quebecor World (USA) Inc., et al.

entitled

Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Quebecor World (USA) Inc.,
et al., v. American United Life Insurance Company, et al.

, filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that we received preference payments relating to notes held by certain of
our insurance subsidiaries and seeks to avoid and recover such payments plus interest and cost of the action. We deny the allegations in the complaint and will vigorously contest them.

In July 2010, we received a subpoena from the Office of the New York Attorney General requesting documents and information relating to certain group life
insurance policies wherein we paid life insurance proceeds by establishing interest-bearing retained asset accounts. We are cooperating with the investigation.

In October 2010,

Denise Merrimon, Bobby S. Mowery, and all others similarly situated vs. Unum Life Insurance Company of America

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Maine. This is a putative class action alleging that we breached fiduciary duties owed to certain beneficiaries under certain group life insurance policies when we paid life insurance proceeds by establishing interest-bearing retained asset accounts
rather than by mailing checks. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of beneficiaries under group life insurance contracts that were employee welfare benefit plans under ERISA and under which we paid death benefits pursuant to a retained asset

account. Plaintiffs seek to recover on behalf of the class the difference between the interest paid to them and amounts alleged to have been realized by us through our investment of the retained
assets. We intend to vigorously defend the action.

Summary

Various lawsuits against us, in addition to those discussed above, have arisen in the normal course of business. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities
regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.

Given
the complexity and scope of our litigation and regulatory matters, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations or legal proceedings or provide reasonable estimates of potential losses, except where noted in
connection with specific matters. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending, in part, on
our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period. We believe, however, that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, should not
have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

Note 14 - Statutory Financial Information

Statutory Net Income, Capital and Surplus, and Dividends

Statutory net income for U.S. life insurance companies is reported in conformity with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC and adopted by applicable domiciliary state laws. The
commissioners of the states of domicile have the right to permit other specific practices that may deviate from prescribed practices. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008, none of the states of domicile for our U.S. insurance
subsidiaries had adopted accounting practices that differed materially from statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC.

The
statutory operating results of our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which exclude Tailwind Re and Northwind Re, as well as the statutory results for these two special purpose financial captive U.S. insurance subsidiaries, are as follows:



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 14 - Statutory Financial Information - Continued

Statutory capital and surplus is as follows:

Restrictions under applicable state
insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities. For life insurance companies domiciled in the United States,
that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer’s statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized
investment gains and losses, of the preceding year.

The payment of dividends to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries is generally
further limited to the amount of unassigned statutory surplus. Based on the restrictions under current law, $622.3 million is available during 2011 for the payment of ordinary dividends to Unum Group from its traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries,
which exclude Tailwind Re and Northwind Re. The ability of Tailwind Re and Northwind Re to pay dividends to their respective parent companies, Tailwind Holdings and Northwind Holdings, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Unum Group, will depend on their
satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Tailwind Re and Northwind Re.

We also
have the ability to receive dividends from our United Kingdom insurance subsidiary, Unum Limited, subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the United Kingdom. Approximately £207.5 million is available
for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2011, subject to regulatory approval.

Deposits

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries had on deposit with U.S. regulatory authorities securities with a book value of
$293.6 million and $292.1 million held for the protection of policyholders.

None

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on that evaluation, these officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the quarter ended December 31,
2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting encompasses the processes and procedures management has established to (i) maintain records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Company’s
transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
(iii) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are appropriately authorized; and (iv) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, any projection of the evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Unum
Group

We have audited Unum Group and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Unum Group and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, Unum Group and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Unum Group and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, cash
flows, and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

compensation plans not approved by stockholders:

UnumProvident Corporation Broad Based Stock Plan of 2001

This plan provided for the grant of stock options to employees, officers, consultants, producers (as defined in the plan) and directors of the Company.
The plan specifically prohibits the granting of any options under the plan to members of the Company’s Board of Directors and to any “officer” of the Company as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the 1934 Act or such other definition of
the term “officer” as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may subsequently adopt for purposes of its “broad-based” requirements of Rule 312.03 of NYSE Listed Company Manual. No awards have been made under the plan to employees
above the level of Vice President. The total number of options available for grant under this plan was 2,000,000. This plan was terminated in December 2007.



Index to Financial Statements

The stock options are non-qualified for U.S. tax purposes. The exercise price of options awarded under this
plan is the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The term of any option issued under the plan cannot exceed ten years. There are provisions for early vesting and/or early termination of the options in the event of retirement, death,
disability and termination of employment. The plan also provides for acceleration of vesting if there is a change in control, subject to certain limitations, and in other circumstances at the Committee’s discretion. The plan includes provisions
for adjustments to the number of shares available for grants, number of shares subject to outstanding grants and the exercise price of outstanding grants in the event of stock splits, stock dividends or other recapitalization.

Unum Limited Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2000

This plan of the Company’s subsidiary, Unum Limited, in the United Kingdom allows employees of Unum Limited to acquire options for shares of the Company’s common stock by making an election to
purchase stock at a price of at least 85% of the market value of the stock on the date prior to the date the invitation to apply for the option is made or, if greater, the nominal value of a share (the Acquisition Price). The total number of options
available for grant under this plan was 200,000. The maximum contribution per month per employee is £200. Contributions are made for a three year period at the end of which the employee can elect to receive cash plus interest or purchase
shares at the Acquisition Price. The directors of Unum Limited are the administrators of the plan. There are provisions for early expiration of options in the event of termination of employment and acceleration of vesting and expiration due to
death, disability or retirement. The plan also provides for acceleration of vesting upon a change of control, reconstruction or voluntary winding up of the Company. The plan includes provisions for adjustments to the number of shares available for
grants, and the number of shares subject to outstanding grants in the event of capitalization, consolidation sub-division or reduction or other variation of the share capital of the Company.

UnumProvident Corporation Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan of 2004

This plan provided for the payment of compensation to the non-employee directors who serve on the Company’s Board. Non-employee directors receive an annual retainer of $80,000, the chairman of the
Board receives a supplemental retainer of $160,000 annually, the chair of the Audit Committee receives a supplemental retainer of $15,000 annually, and each of the other chairs of the standing committees receive an annual supplemental retainer of
$7,500, and all directors receive $2,000 for each meeting attended in person and $500 for each conference call meeting of the Board and of the committees on which they participate, including special committees. Under the plan, directors made an
irrevocable election each year to receive all or a portion of their retainers and meeting fees in either cash or deferred share rights. A deferred share right is a right to receive one share of common stock on the earlier of (i) the
director’s separation from service as a director of the Company, or (ii) another designated date at least three years after the date of the deferral election. The number of deferred share rights granted is calculated as the number of whole
shares equal to (i) the dollar amount of the annual retainer and/or fees that the director elects to have paid in deferred share rights, divided by (ii) the fair market value per share on the grant date. The aggregate number of shares
which can be issued under the plan is 500,000. This plan terminated in May 2010. The plan is administered by the Human Capital Committee. The plan includes provisions restricting the transferability of the deferred share rights, provisions for
adjustments to the number of shares available for grants, and the number of shares subject to outstanding grants in the event of recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other
similar corporate transaction. There are stock ownership guidelines for participants under the plan.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Unum Group and subsidiaries.

Note 2 - Debt

Long-term and short-term debt consists of the following:

The junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 are callable under limited, specified circumstances. The remaining callable
debt may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time. The aggregate contractual principal maturities are $225.1 million in 2011 and $1,632.6 million in 2016 and thereafter.

Unsecured Notes

In September 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior
notes in a public offering. In 2010, we purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.

In 2009, we issued
$350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. In 2009, we purchased and retired $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028 and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028.

Fair Value Hedge

During 2010,
we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% unsecured senior notes into floating rate debt. Under this agreement, we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable
rate of interest, based off of the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate. The fair value adjustment of the swap resulted in a reduction of the carrying amount of the hedged debt of $14.4 million at December 31, 2010.
