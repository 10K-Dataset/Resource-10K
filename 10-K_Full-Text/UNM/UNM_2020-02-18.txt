PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Unum Group, a Delaware general business corporation, and its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively with Unum Group we refer to as the Company, operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, and, to a limited extent, in certain other countries.  The principal operating subsidiaries in the United States are Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum America), Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company (Provident), The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company (Paul Revere Life), Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company, Starmount Life Insurance Company (Starmount Life), in the United Kingdom, Unum Limited, and in Poland, Unum Zycie TUiR S.A. (Unum Poland).  We are a leading provider of financial protection benefits in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Our products include disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision, and other related services.  We market our products primarily through the workplace.

We have three principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life.  Our other segments are the Closed Block and Corporate segments.  These segments are discussed more fully under "Reporting Segments" included herein in this Item 1.

Business Strategies

The benefits we provide help the working world thrive throughout life's moments and protect people from the financial hardship of illness, injury, or loss of life by providing support when it is needed most.  As a leading provider of employee benefits, we offer a broad portfolio of products and services through the workplace.

Specifically, we offer group, individual, voluntary, and dental and vision products as well as provide certain fee-based services.  These products and services, which can be sold stand-alone or combined with other coverages, help employers of all sizes attract and retain a stronger workforce while protecting the incomes and livelihood of their employees.  We believe employer-sponsored benefits are the most effective way to provide workers with access to information and options to protect their financial stability.  Working people and their families, particularly those at lower and middle incomes, are perhaps the most vulnerable in today's economy yet are often overlooked by many providers of financial services and products.  For many of these people, employer-sponsored benefits are the primary defense against the potentially catastrophic fallout of death, illness, or injury.

We have established a corporate culture consistent with the social values our products provide.  Because we see important links between the obligations we have to all of our stakeholders, we place a strong emphasis on contributing to positive change in our communities.  Accordingly, we are committed not only to meeting the needs of our customers who depend on us, but also to operating with integrity and being accountable for our actions through sound and consistent business practices, a strong internal compliance program, and a comprehensive risk management strategy.

We believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength as we seek to capitalize on the growing and largely unfilled need for our products and services.  We believe the need for our products and services remains strong, and we intend to continue protecting our solid margins and returns through our pricing and risk management actions.  Our strategy is centered on growing our existing business, expanding our reach, and investing in our operations and technology to anticipate and respond to new market demands to meet the changing needs of our customers.

Although the low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins, we continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate this environment and allow us to maintain solid operating margins and significant financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses, while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders and exploring merger and acquisition opportunities to enhance our business lines.  The continued strong labor market in the U.S. and the high level of consumer confidence will have positive impacts on our business.  We have substantial leverage to rising interest rates and an improving economy which generates payroll growth and wage inflation.  We believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our long-term financial objectives.


Reporting Segments

Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate.  The percentage of consolidated premium income generated by each reporting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 is as follows:

Financial information is provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7 and Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Unum US Segment

Our Unum US segment includes group long-term and short-term disability products, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which include individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products.  Our Unum US segment also includes fee-based leave management services and administrative services only (ASO) business.  Unum US products are issued primarily by Unum America, Provident, and Starmount Life.  Paul Revere Life previously issued products reported in our Unum US segment and continues to service the in-force policies, but Paul Revere Life no longer actively markets new business.  These products are marketed through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants.  Our market strategy for Unum US is to effectively deliver an integrated offering of employee benefit products in the group core market segment, which we define for Unum US as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 employees, the group large case market segment, and the supplemental and voluntary market segment.

The percentage of Unum US segment premium income generated by each product line during 2019 is as follows:

Group Long-term and Short-term Disability

We sell group long-term and short-term disability products to employers for the benefit of employees.

Group long-term disability provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or injury.  We offer services to employers and insureds to encourage and facilitate rehabilitation, retraining, and re-employment.  Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or 180 day waiting periods and continue providing benefits until the employee reaches a certain age, generally between 65 and 70, or recovers from the disability.  The benefits are limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income.  Also included in our long-term disability product line is our medical stop-loss product, which is designed to protect self-insured employers if their employees' medical claims exceed certain agreed upon thresholds.

Group short-term disability insurance generally provides coverage from loss of income due to injury or sickness for up to 26 weeks, and is limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income.  Benefits are effective immediately for accidents and after one week for sickness.

Our leave management services provide administrative services on behalf of employers to ensure the protected leave eligibility and status for employees are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  ASO products provide administrative services


regarding claims processing and billing for self-insured customers for which the responsibility for funding claim payments remain with the customer.

Premiums for group long-term and short-term disability are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  In some cases, coverage for large employers will include retrospective experience rating provisions or will be underwritten on an experience-rated basis.  Premiums for experience-rated group long-term and short-term disability business are based on the expected experience of the client given its demographics, industry group, and location, adjusted for the credibility of the specific claim experience of the client.  Both group long-term and short-term disability are sold primarily on a basis permitting periodic repricing to address the underlying claims experience.  Fees for our leave management services and ASO business are generally based on the number of covered employees and an agreed-upon per-employee, per-month rate.  Premiums for our medical stop-loss product are generally based on the number of covered employees in self-insured employer groups and their estimated overall health risk plus provisions for administrative expenses, and profit.

We have defined underwriting practices and procedures.  If the coverage amount for our disability policies exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability.  Our disability policies are typically issued, both at inception and renewal, with rate guarantees.  For new group policyholders, the usual rate guarantee is one to three years.  For group policies being renewed, the rate guarantee is generally one year, but may be longer.  The profitability of the policy depends on the adequacy of the rate during the rate guarantee period.  The contracts provide for certain circumstances in which the rate guarantees can be overridden.  Our medical stop loss contracts are renewable on an annual basis and rates are not guaranteed beyond one year.  There is no requirement for prospective insureds to submit evidence of insurability because coverage levels are determined for the group as a whole.

Profitability of group long-term and short-term disability insurance and our medical stop-loss product is affected by sales, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.  Morbidity is an important factor in disability claims experience, and many economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence for disability insurance.  We routinely make pricing adjustments on our group long-term and short-term disability insurance products, when contractually permitted, which take into account emerging experience and external factors.

Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment

Group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are sold to employers as employee benefit products.  Group life consists primarily of renewable term life insurance with the coverages frequently linked to employees' wages and includes a provision for waiver of premium, if disabled.  Accidental death and dismemberment consists primarily of an additional benefit amount payable if death or severe injury is attributable to an accident.

Premiums are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  Underwriting practices and rate guarantees are similar to those used for group disability products, and evidence of insurability is required for benefits in excess of a specified limit.

Profitability of group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Individual Disability

Individual disability products are offered primarily to multi-life employer groups to supplement their group disability plans and may be funded by the employer, but the policy is owned by the employee and is portable.  Individual disability insurance provides the insured with a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury.  The benefits, including the underlying group disability coverage, typically range from 30 percent to 75 percent of the insured's monthly earned income.  We provide various options with respect to length of benefit periods, product features, and waiting periods before benefit payments begin, which permit tailoring of the multi-life plan to a specific employer's needs.  We also market individual disability policies which include payments for the transfer of business ownership between partners and payments for business overhead expenses, also on a multi-life basis.  Individual disability products do not provide for the accumulation of cash values.

Premium rates for individual disability products vary by age, product features, and occupation based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  We develop our assumptions based on our own experience.  Our underwriting rules, issue limits, and plan designs reflect risk and the financial circumstances of prospective insureds.  Individuals in multi-life groups may be subject to limited medical underwriting.  The majority of our


individual disability policies are written on a noncancelable basis.  Under a noncancelable policy, as long as the insured continues to pay the fixed annual premium for the policy's duration, we cannot cancel the policy or change the premium.

Profitability of individual disability insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Voluntary Benefits

Voluntary benefits products are primarily sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace and include life, disability, accident, hospital indemnity, cancer, and critical illness offered on both a group and individual basis.

Premium rates for voluntary benefits products are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables.  Our underwriters evaluate the medical condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy on a simplified basis.  Underwriting requirements may be waived for cases that meet certain criteria, including participation levels.  Individual voluntary benefits products other than life insurance are offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval.  Group voluntary benefits products are offered primarily on an optionally renewable basis which allows us to re-price or terminate in-force policies.

Profitability of voluntary benefits products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Dental and Vision

Group dental and vision products are sold to employers as employee benefit products.  Our group dental products include a variety of insured and self-insured dental care plans including preferred provider organizations and scheduled reimbursement plans.  Our group vision products provide coverage that includes a range of both in-network and out-of-network benefits for routine vision services offered either in conjunction with our dental product offerings or as stand-alone coverage.

Premiums for small case group dental and vision products are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus a provision for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  Premiums for large employer groups are underwritten on an experience-rated basis.

Profitability of our dental and vision products is affected by persistency, claims experience, the level of administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent, investment returns.

Unum International Segment

The Unum International segment includes our operations in the United Kingdom and Poland.  Unum UK's business includes insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business which include dental, individual disability, and critical illness products.  Unum Poland's business primarily includes insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders.  Both Unum UK's and Unum Poland's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants.  The market strategy for the segment is to offer benefits to employers and employees through the workplace, with a focus on the expansion of the number of employers and employees covered in our Unum UK core market segment, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 500 employees, and the growth of the existing Unum Poland business through the incorporation of our benefits and distribution expertise.

The percentage of Unum International segment premium income generated by each product line during 2019 is as follows:


Unum UK Group Long-term Disability

Group long-term disability products are sold to employers for the benefit of employees.  Group long-term disability provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or injury.  Services are offered to employers and insureds to encourage and facilitate rehabilitation, retraining, and re-employment.  Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or 180 day waiting periods and continue providing benefits until the employee reaches a certain age or reaches the end of the limited period specified in the policy terms.  The benefits are limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income.

Premiums for group long-term disability are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  Some cases carry experience rating provisions.  Premiums for experience-rated group long-term disability business are based on the expected experience of the client given its demographics, industry group, and location, adjusted for the credibility of the specific claim experience of the client.  Policies are sold primarily on a basis permitting periodic repricing to address the underlying claims experience.

We have defined underwriting practices and procedures.  If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability.  Policies are typically issued, both at inception and renewal, with rate guarantees.  The usual rate guarantee is two years but may vary depending on circumstances.  The profitability of the policy is dependent upon the adequacy of the rate during the rate guarantee period.  The contracts provide for certain circumstances in which the rate guarantees can be overridden.

Profitability of group long-term disability insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.  Morbidity is an important factor in disability claims experience.  We routinely make pricing adjustments on our group insurance products, when contractually permitted, which take into account emerging experience and external factors.

Unum UK Group Life

Group life products are sold to employers as employee benefit products.  Group life consists of two types of products, a renewable term life insurance product and a group dependent life product.  The renewable term life product provides a lump sum benefit to the beneficiary on death of an employee.  The group dependent life product, which we discontinued offering to new customers in 2012, provides an annuity to the beneficiary upon the death of an employee.  Both coverages are frequently linked to employees' wages.  Premiums for group life are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products.

Profitability of group life is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Unum UK Supplemental

Supplemental products are sold to individual retail customers as well as groups of employees and include individual disability, group and individual critical illness, and group dental.  Individual disability products provide the insured with a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury.  Critical illness products provide a lump-sum benefit on the occurrence of a covered critical illness event.  Group dental products generally provide fixed benefits based on specified treatments or a portion of the cost of the treatment.

Premiums for our individual products vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables.  Approximately one half of our individual disability policies are written on a noncancelable basis.  The remainder of our individual disability policies and all of our individual critical illness products are offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies.  Our underwriters evaluate the medical and financial condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy.

Premiums for group critical illness products are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products.  Premiums for group dental products are generally based on standard industry rates that vary by age, with minor pricing variation based on the number of covered employees in the group.


Profitability of our supplemental products is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Unum Poland

Unum Poland products, which include both individual and group life products, provide renewable term and whole life insurance with accident and health riders.  Premiums are based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  Profitability of our Unum Poland products is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Colonial Life Segment

Our Colonial Life segment includes accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products.  These products are issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers.  Our market strategy for Colonial Life is to effectively deliver a broad set of voluntary products and services in the public sector market and in the commercial market, with a particular focus on the core commercial market segment, which we define for Colonial Life as accounts with fewer than 1,000 employees.

We have defined underwriting practices and procedures for each of our products.  Most policies are issued on a simplified issue basis, based on answers to simple health and employment questions.  If the amount applied for exceeds certain levels, the applicant may be asked to answer additional health questions or submit to additional medical examinations.

The percentage of Colonial Life segment premium income generated by each product line during 2019 is as follows:

Accident, Sickness, and Disability

The accident, sickness, and disability product line consists of short-term disability plans, accident-only plans providing benefits for injuries on a specified loss basis, and our dental and vision products.  It also includes accident and health plans covering hospital admissions, confinement, and surgeries.

Premiums for accident, sickness, and disability products are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  We develop our assumptions based on our own experience.  Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable for which we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis.  A small percentage of the policies are written on a group basis for which we retain the right to change premiums at the individual account level.  Premiums for our dental and vision products are generally guaranteed issue with standard industry rates that vary by age and region.

Profitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Life

Life products are primarily comprised of universal life, whole life, and term life policies.

Premium rates vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  We develop our assumptions based on our own experience and published industry tables.  Premiums for the whole life and level term products are guaranteed for the life of the contract.  Premiums for the universal life products are flexible and may vary at the individual policyholder level.  For the group term life products, we retain the right to change premiums at the account level based on the experience of the account.


Profitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Cancer and Critical Illness

Cancer policies provide various benefits for the treatment of cancer including hospitalization, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.  Critical illness policies provide a lump-sum benefit and/or fixed payments on the occurrence of a covered critical illness event.

Premiums are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  We develop our assumptions based on our own experience.  Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable wherein we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis.

Profitability of these products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Closed Block Segment

Our Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care, individual disability, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed.  Closed Block segment premium income for 2019 was comprised of approximately 64 percent group and individual long-term care and 36 percent individual disability.

Group and Individual Long-term Care

We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012.  Group long-term care was previously offered to employers for the benefit of employees.  Individual long-term care was previously marketed on a single-life customer basis.

Long-term care insurance pays a benefit upon the loss of two or more activities of daily living and the insured's requirement of standby assistance or cognitive impairment.  Payment is generally made on an indemnity basis, regardless of expenses incurred, up to a lifetime maximum.  Benefits begin after a waiting period, usually 90 days or less, and are generally paid for a period of three years, six years, or lifetime.

Our long-term care insurance was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval.  Premium rates for long-term care vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit.  Premium rate increases continue to be implemented where needed and where approved by state regulators.  We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables.

Profitability is affected by premium rate increases, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Individual Disability

We began limiting sales of the types of individual disability policies reported in our Closed Block segment subsequent to the mid-1990s after substantial changes in product design were implemented to improve the overall risk profile of our offerings of individual disability products.  We entirely discontinued issuing new policies in this closed block of business in 2004.  The majority of the policies were written on a noncancelable basis and were marketed on a single-life customer basis.  Profitability is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Other

Other insurance products not actively marketed include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines.  The majority of these products have been reinsured, with approximately 80 percent of reserves at December 31, 2019 ceded to other insurance companies.


Corporate Segment

Our Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expenses not allocated to a line of business.

Reinsurance

In the normal course of business, we assume reinsurance from and cede reinsurance to other insurance companies.  In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium or fee.  We undertake reinsurance transactions for both risk management and capital management.  If the assuming reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement is unable to meet its obligations, we remain contingently liable.  In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible.  We evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure.  We may also require assets to be held in trust, letters of credit, or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances.  The collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers.  Although we have controls to minimize our exposure, the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In general, the maximum amount of life insurance risk retained by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries under group or individual life or group or individual accidental death and dismemberment policies during 2019 was $1 million per covered life per policy.  The retention amount remains at $1 million for 2020.  For Unum Limited life insurance risk, during 2019 we had reinsurance agreements which provided 75 percent coverage up to £500 thousand per covered life for group dependent life benefits and 25 percent coverage for group lump sum benefits, as well as 100 percent coverage per covered life above that amount.  The same structures will be maintained for coverage during 2020 for Unum Limited.

We have reinsurance agreements on approximately 76 percent of our Closed Block individual disability business.  As of December 31, 2019, this reinsurance covers approximately 67 percent of that portion of the consolidated risk above a $3.9 billion retention limit.  The risk limit for the reinsurer grows over time to a maximum of $2.2 billion, after which any further losses will revert to us.

We have global catastrophic reinsurance coverage which covers all Unum Group insurance companies and includes four layers of coverage to limit our exposure under life, accidental death and dismemberment, long-term care, and disability policies in regard to a catastrophic event.  Each layer provides coverage for all catastrophic events, including acts of war and any type of terrorism, up to $1 million of coverage per person per policy for each U.S. and non-U.K. line of covered business, and up to £2 million of coverage for each U.K. covered line of business.  We have the following coverage for 2020, after a $100 million deductible:


In addition to the global catastrophic reinsurance coverage noted above, Unum Limited has additional catastrophic coverage via an arms-length, inter-company reinsurance agreement with Unum America, under similar terms as the global catastrophic treaties.  Unum Limited has the following additional coverage for 2020, after a £75 million deductible:

Unum Poland has additional global catastrophic reinsurance coverage of up to

zł

70 million with a maximum retention limit of

zł

0.8 million in 2019.  Insurable events include passive war, as well as nuclear, chemical, biological and other forms of terrorism.  This agreement was renewed with the same conditions for 2020.

Events may occur which limit or eliminate the availability of catastrophic reinsurance coverage in future years.

We have a quota share reinsurance agreement under which we cede certain blocks of Unum US group long-term disability claims.  The agreement is on a combination coinsurance with funds withheld and modified coinsurance basis and provides 90 percent quota share reinsurance on the ceded claims.  We also have four reinsurance agreements that collectively cede approximately 55 percent of Unum US group life risk up to our per person retention limit for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.  These reinsurance agreements for Unum US group disability and group life allow us to more effectively manage capital in conformity with statutory accounting principles but do not meet insurance risk transfer in accordance with applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and therefore are not accounted for as reinsurance in our consolidated GAAP financial statements.

We also cede 30 percent of the risk for certain blocks of recently issued Unum US individual disability policies, as well as some related claims development risk for a limited period of time.  The agreement is on a non-proportional modified coinsurance basis with a provision for experience refunds.

Certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re) and Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries (captive reinsurers) domiciled in the United States, with Unum Group as the ultimate parent.  These captive reinsurers were established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency.  On a consolidated reporting basis for Unum Group, financial statement impacts of our reinsurance arrangements with affiliates are eliminated in accordance with GAAP.

For further discussion of our reinsurance activities, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A; "Consolidated Operating Results," "Segment Results," and "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Available from Subsidiaries" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1, 12, and 16 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits

The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies.  These reserves are the amounts which, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature.  These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates, and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting.

The reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries.  These differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods.


The assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable.  If actual experience is equal, or favorable, to our reserve assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses.  If experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be required.  The key experience assumptions include claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency, interest rates, premium rate increases, and any applicable policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits.  We periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserves for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.

The consolidated statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits.  The change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses, deaths, and benefit payments.  If policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs, the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits.

For further discussion of reserves, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A, "Critical Accounting Estimates" and the discussion of segment operating results included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1 and 6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Investments

Investment activities are an integral part of our business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results.  We segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines.  Generally, our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses.  We seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner, subject to constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations.  Our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products.  Assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities.  Changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows.

We actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk.  We may redistribute investments among our different lines of business, when necessary, to adjust the cash flow and/or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios.  Asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy.  Cash flows from the in-force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios.  These results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates.  Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes.  Although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling, the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive, and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk.  Our determination of investment strategy relies on long-term measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rate assumptions embedded in the reserves.  We also use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A; "Critical Accounting Estimates" and the discussion of investments in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7; "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" herein in Item 7A; and Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for information on our investments and derivative financial instruments.

Ratings

AM Best, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries.  Issuer credit ratings reflect an agency's opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior


debt obligations.  Financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency's view of the overall financial strength (capital levels, earnings, growth, investments, business mix, operating performance, and market position) of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders.  Both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.

Rating agencies assign an outlook statement of "positive," "negative," or "developing" to indicate an intermediate-term trend in credit fundamentals which could lead to a rating change.  "Positive" means that a rating may be raised, "negative" means that a rating may be lowered, and "developing" means that a rating may be raised or lowered with equal probability.  Alternatively, a rating may have a "stable" outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change.

"Credit watch" or "under review" highlights the potential direction of a short-term or long-term rating.  It focuses on identifiable events and short-term trends that cause a rating to be placed under heightened surveillance by a rating agency.  Events that may trigger this action include mergers, acquisitions, recapitalizations, regulatory actions, criteria changes, or operating developments.  Ratings may be placed on credit watch or under review when an event or a change in an expected trend occurs and additional information is needed to evaluate the current rating level.  This status does not mean that a rating change is inevitable, and ratings may change without first being placed on a watch list.  A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Ratings" contained herein in Item 7 for our current outlook, issuer credit, and financial strength ratings.  See also further discussion in "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A.

Competition

There is significant competition among insurance companies for the types of products we sell, particularly in the voluntary benefits market.  We are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and non-traditional competitors, with changes in product offerings, enrollment services, and technology solutions.  We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price, quality of the customer experience regarding service and claims management, integrated product choices, enrollment capabilities, financial strength ratings, claims-paying ratings, and a solution to allow our customers to comply with the changing laws and regulations related to family medical leave benefits.

In the individual and group disability markets, we compete in the United States with a number of major companies and regionally with other companies offering specialty products.  Our principal competitors for our other products, including group life and the product offerings sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction, include the largest insurance companies in the United States.  Some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claims-paying ratings.  Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete.

In the United Kingdom and Poland, where we sell both individual and group products, we compete with a mix of large internationally recognized providers and strong local carriers.

All areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of our products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market.  There is a risk that our customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms or improved technology solutions from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us.  The effect of competition may, as a result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

We must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively market our products.  Strong competition exists among insurers for agents and brokers.  We compete with other insurers for sales agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our product offerings, financial strength, support services, and compensation.  Sales of our products could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents and brokers.

For further discussion, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A.


Regulation

We and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive and comprehensive supervision and regulation in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland.  The laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change.  New or existing laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.

Insurance Regulation and Oversight

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they do business and by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on a national basis, primarily for the protection of policyholders.  State insurance regulators in the U.S. generally have broad powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business, including the power to: license and examine insurance companies; regulate and supervise sales practices and market conduct; license agents and brokers; approve policy forms; approve premium rates and subsequent increases thereon for certain insurance products; establish reserve requirements and solvency standards; place limitations on shareholder dividends; prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports; regulate the types and amounts of permitted investments; and regulate reinsurance transactions.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically by their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business.  The domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders, but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing, such as market conduct issues and reserve adequacy.  Examinations in other states more typically focus on market conduct, such as a review of sales practices, including the content and use of advertising materials and the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers, as well as underwriting, claims, and customer service practices, and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers.  The DOL enforces a comprehensive federal statute which regulates claims paying fiduciary responsibilities and reporting and disclosure requirements for most employee benefit plans.

Our U.K. insurance subsidiary, Unum Limited, is subject to dual regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  The PRA oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and day-to-day supervision of insurance companies.  The FCA seeks to protect consumers and oversees financial services products and practices, including those governing insurance companies in the U.K.

On January 31, 2020, an official bill was passed formalizing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union (EU).  The bill gives approval to an 11-month transition period, until December 31, 2020, to allow for further negotiations regarding the details of the future relationship.  The U.K.'s decision to leave the EU may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts if new laws and regulations are established that significantly diverge from those currently in place, however, we are not aware of any indications of such changes in the short-term and do not expect significant changes over the longer term.  Additionally, the insurance policies issued by our U.K. insurance subsidiary cover businesses and policyholders based in the U.K.  We do not expect these policies to be affected by the U.K.'s exit nor do we anticipate the need to obtain additional insurance permissions to be able to continue writing these policies.  For the small amount of contracts and coverages provided to companies and individuals outside of the U.K., we have developed contingency plans that could be invoked following the U.K.'s exit.  The employees that support our U.K. business reside in the U.K. and will not need to change residence status.

Our Polish insurance subsidiary, Unum Zycie TUiR, is subject to regulation by the Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (KNF) of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) in Poland.  The KNF oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and day-to-day supervision of insurance companies and other financial institutions.


Capital Requirements

Risk-based capital (RBC) standards for U.S. life insurance companies are prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).  The domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the NAIC RBC Model Act, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers.  The basis of the system is a risk-based formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer's business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer.  The life and health RBC formula is designed to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks.  The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized.  The formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally.  The NAIC has also issued a proposal to implement a new and more granular RBC structure for fixed income asset capital charges.  The proposed structure will expand the fixed income asset designations from six to 20 categories and will revise factor values.  We will continue to monitor the NAIC's activities on this issue.

The NAIC continues to review the state-based solvency regulation framework to identify opportunities to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments.  The topics of its review include capital requirements, governance and risk management, statutory accounting and financial reporting, and reinsurance.  This ongoing review will likely result in significant changes to U.S. insurance regulation and solvency standards, including those for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.  One of the outcomes of the NAIC's review was the adoption of the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act which, following enactment at the state level, requires insurers to provide, at least annually, a group-level perspective on the risks of the current and future business plans and the sufficiency of capital to support those risks.  All states where our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have enacted ORSA requirements, and we file an ORSA summary report annually with the applicable insurance regulators.

The NAIC has established a working group charged with

developing a group capital calculation that can be used by regulators as a baseline quantitative measure in assessing the risks and financial position of insurance groups.

The working group completed its work on the U.S. group capital calculation and conducted field testing during the second half of 2019.  The calculation and related instructions are being revised to incorporate findings and observations from the field testing and are expected to be adopted by the NAIC in late 2020.  We are also monitoring developments around the implementation of reforms adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) in November 2019 that established similar group capital requirements.  We are not subject to the reforms adopted by the IAIS, however, the requirements could influence the reforms that will be adopted by the NAIC.  We will continue to monitor the NAIC's activities on this issue but it is still too early to determine what, if any, impact these developments will have on our capital requirements.

The NAIC has adopted a valuation manual containing a principles-based approach to life insurance company reserves for new business.  The earliest effective date was January 2017 with a three-year optional period before mandatory adoption by January 2020.  The Company elected a staged approach to the implementation of the new requirements, with no material impact on our statutory reserves.

In 2012, the NAIC established a subgroup to study the insurance industry's use of captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and is considering ways to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such reinsurers.  More recently, the NAIC adopted a proposal to subject certain captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to the same capital requirements as traditional insurers.  As the NAIC and state insurance regulators continue to examine the use of captive insurance companies to finance reserves required under current regulations, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of their work, or how long or extensively they will continue to focus on this issue.  Although we believe it to be unlikely, a potential outcome of future NAIC decisions from its various committees, task forces, and working groups is that companies could be prohibited from using captive reinsurers.  No changes in the use or regulation of captive reinsurers have been proposed by the NAIC, and we are unable to predict the extent of any changes that might be made.  Accordingly, we expect to continue our strategy of using captive reinsurers to manage risks and enhance capital efficiency while monitoring the NAIC's study and proposed changes in regulations.  See "Reinsurance" contained herein in this Item 1 for further discussion.

The PRA has statutory requirements, including capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and minimum solvency margins, to which Unum Limited must adhere as part of the provisions of Solvency II, an EU directive that prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry.  Our European holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies, while its subsidiaries, which includes Unum Limited, are subject to group supervision under Solvency II.  The Unum European Economic Area (EEA) Group, which is comprised of the European holding company and its subsidiaries, received approval from the PRA to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the


Solvency II capital regime is implemented.  Although there are currently no indications that the regulatory capital regime for our U.K. operations will change due to the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU, it remains too early to predict what, if any, impact this may have on existing capital requirements for our U.K. entities, but economic conditions may cause volatility in our solvency ratios.

See further discussion in "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained herein in Item 7 and Note 16 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation

We and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries (excluding captive reinsurers) are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which currently include Maine, Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  These laws generally require each insurance company that is domiciled in the state and a member of an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of that state and to furnish at least annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system, including information concerning capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, and certain intercompany transactions.  Transactions between an insurer and affiliates in the holding company system generally must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval by the domiciliary insurance regulator.

In addition, such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders, including our Company and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries.  See further discussion in "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A and "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Available from Subsidiaries" contained herein in Item 7.

The NAIC has adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulation, which require U.S. insurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices.  The model act and regulation must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective in a particular state.  At this time, among the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the model act and regulation are effective only in Maine, Massachusetts, and Tennessee.

The NAIC has also adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which creates a legal framework that requires insurance companies to establish cybersecurity programs designed to protect the private data of consumers.  The law outlines planned cybersecurity testing, and the development of incident response plans for breach notification procedures.  The model law must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective in particular state.  At this time, among the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the model law is effective only in South Carolina.  The New York State Department of Financial Services has established similar regulations to this law and the state of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.

The laws of most states, including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (or deemed to be commercially domiciled), require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company.  Where these laws apply to us, there can be no effective change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change.  The usual measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company, although this presumption is rebuttable.  Consequently, a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the state(s) of domicile of the insurance company(ies) sought to be acquired (or whose holding company is sought to be acquired) will be in violation of these laws.  Such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions: (i) injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those shares by the applicable insurance regulators; (ii) prohibition of voting of such shares; and (iii) other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators.  Further, many states' insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a non-domiciled insurance company doing business in the state.  These pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control; however, they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist, such as undue market concentration.  Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted pre-notification laws.


These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change in control of our Company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.

Federal Laws and Regulations

We are subject to the laws and regulations generally applicable to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange relating to public reporting and disclosure, accounting and financial reporting, corporate governance, and securities trading.  Further, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and rules and regulations adopted under this regulation, have increased the requirements for us and other public companies in these and other areas.

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies.  The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.  Anti-money laundering laws outside of the United States contain some similar provisions.  Additionally, other federal laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Asset's Controls, as well as the U.K.'s Bribery Act of 2010, have increased requirements relating to identifying customers, prohibiting transactions with certain organizations or individuals, watching for and reporting suspicious transactions, responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, sharing information with other financial institutions, and requiring the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures, and controls.

We are subject to federal income, employment, excise and other taxes related to both our U.S. and our foreign operations.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, more commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).  The key provisions of the TCJA relevant to us are as follows:

•

Establishes a corporate income tax rate of 21 percent;

•

Creates a territorial tax system rather than a worldwide system, which will generally allow companies to repatriate future foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. taxes by providing a 100 percent exemption for the foreign source portion of dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries;

•

Subjects undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits to a one-time transition tax also referred to as a deemed repatriation toll charge;

•

Creates a U.S. shareholder tax on certain foreign subsidiary income above a routine equity return on tangible depreciable business assets (Global Intangible Low-taxed Income);

•

Decreases tax-deductible life and property and casualty insurance reserves;

•

Increases the amount and amortization period of acquisition costs capitalized for tax purposes;

•

Reduces the maximum deduction for net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards arising in companies other than non-life insurance companies in tax years beginning after 2017 to a percentage of the taxpayer's taxable income.  It also allows any NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to be carried forward indefinitely and repeals carrybacks.  NOL provisions for non-life insurance companies remain unchanged from current law;

•

Allows businesses to immediately write off the cost of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets made after September 27, 2017 subject to phase downs starting in 2023;

•

Eliminates or reduces certain deductions (including deductions for certain compensation arrangements, certain payments made to governments for violations of law and certain legal settlements), exclusions and credits and adds other provisions that broaden the tax base; and

•

Creates a new base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) that subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to a related foreign company to additional taxes.

See "Executive Summary" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 7 and 16 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for discussion of the impact to our financial position and results of operations as a result of these changes.

Federal tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change could materially impact our federal taxes and reduce profitability as well as capital levels in our insurance subsidiaries.  We continually monitor federal tax legislative and regulatory developments to understand their potential impact on our profitability.

Geographic Areas

Adjusted operating revenue, which excludes net realized investment gains and losses, for our Unum International segment was approximately 6 percent of our consolidated adjusted operating revenue in 2019, 2018, and 2017.  As of December 31, 2019, total assets equaled approximately 6 percent of consolidated assets and total liabilities equaled approximately 5 percent of consolidated liabilities for our Unum International segment.  Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of our Unum International segment will impact our reported operating results.  See "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" contained herein in Item 7A for further discussion of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  See "Reporting Segments" contained herein in this Item 1; "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7; and Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of Unum International's operating results.

Employees

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Overview

We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures.  Discussed below are factors that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  Any one or more of the following factors may cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company, including those in this document or made by us elsewhere, such as in earnings release investor calls, investor conference presentations, or press releases.  See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" contained herein on page 1.

Market and Credit Risks

Sustained periods of low interest rates in the long-term investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products and projecting our pension obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Declines in interest rates and/or the continuance of the current level of low interest rates and yields on fixed income investments may cause the rates of return on our investment portfolio to decrease more than expected, leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products.  An interest, or discount, rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products.  We set our GAAP reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions.  If the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments.  In that case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient, resulting in the need to increase our reserves and/or contribute additional capital to our insurance subsidiaries, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  Similarly, we are required to perform annual adequacy testing, that considers multiple interest rate scenarios, to ensure our statutory reserves continue to meet statutory requirements, which could also require a need to increase our statutory reserves and/or contribute additional capital.

Our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for our pension plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience.  Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount (interest) rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets.  We set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits.  A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs.  Our expectations for the future investment returns on plan assets are based on a combination of historical market performance, current market conditions, and future capital market assumptions obtained from external consultants and economists.  The actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and end of the measurement period.  Increases or decreases in long-term interest rates as well as equity market volatility will impact the fair value of our plan assets and may result in a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans and/or increased pension costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Unfavorable economic or market conditions may result in lower sales, lower premium growth and persistency, higher claims incidence, unfavorable mortality, and longer claims duration, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

We are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the general economy, primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, and to a lesser extent, the broader global financial markets.  Negative developments in the capital markets and/or the general economy could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

In particular, factors such as unemployment levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation, pandemics, and the threat of terrorism all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our businesses.  Given the nature of our products, in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower personal income, reduced consumer spending, and lower corporate earnings and investment, new product sales may be adversely affected.  Our premium growth may also be negatively impacted by lower premium growth from existing customers due to lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy.  In addition, during such periods we may experience


higher claims incidence, longer claims duration, and/or an increase in policy lapses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

In addition to interest rate risk as previously discussed, we are exposed to other risks related to our investment portfolio which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Default Risk

Our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities.  These securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer.  Factors such as an economic downturn or political change in the country of the issuer, a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer's industry, a significant deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer, unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by the issuer, widening risk spreads, ratings downgrades, a change in the issuer's marketplace or business prospects, or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these securities may result in the issuer defaulting on its obligations.

Our mortgage loan portfolio has default risk.  Events or developments, such as economic conditions that impact the ability of tenants to pay their rents or limit the availability of refinancing, may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio.  Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on an investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated in that region or sector.

A default results in the recognition of an impairment loss on the investment.  A default may also adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest due to us.  The probability of credit downgrades and defaults increases when the fixed income markets experience periods of volatility and illiquidity.

Credit Spread Risk

Our exposure to credit spreads, which is the yield above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads.  A widening of credit spreads may unfavorably impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of the investment portfolio and may adversely impact liquidity.  Credit spread tightening may reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed income securities.

Valuation Risk

We report our fixed maturity securities and certain other financial instruments at fair value.  Valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, particularly during periods of market disruption, resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold.  Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported in our financial statements, and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly.  Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We evaluate our investment portfolio for impairments.  There can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken.  Additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments.  Any event reducing the value of our securities other than on a temporary basis may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Market Timing and Liquidity Risk

While we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business, there may at times be a lack of appropriate investments in the market which can be acquired.  In particular, due to the long duration of our long-term care product, the timing of our investment cash flows do not match those of our maturing liabilities.  In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements, changes in tax laws, rating agency decisions, and/or unexpected changes in liquidity needs.  There may also be a limited market for certain of our investments, such as our private placement fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, and policy loans, which makes them more illiquid.  In periods of market volatility or disruption, other of our securities may also experience reduced liquidity.  If events occur wherein we need to sell securities in an unfavorable interest rate or credit environment or need to quickly sell securities which are illiquid, market prices may be lower


than what we might realize under normal circumstances, with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Reinsurance may not be available or affordable, or reinsurers may be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our reinsurance contracts, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

As part of our overall risk management and capital management strategies, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various businesses.  Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance.  Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and may impact the level of capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries, and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our results of operations.  Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to write future business, result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue, and increase our capital requirements.  The collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers.  We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis.  The insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

The effectiveness and utilization of our hedging programs may be affected by changes in the economic environment, changes in interest rates, capital market volatility, non-performance by our counterparties, changes in the level of required collateral, or regulation, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

We use derivative financial instruments to help us manage certain risks related to our business operations, primarily foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities.  Factors associated with derivative financial instruments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  Ineffectiveness of our hedges due to changes in expected future events, such as the risk created by uncertainty in the economic environment or if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivative instruments, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  Capital market turmoil may result in an increase in the risk of non-performance by our counterparties, many of which are financial institutions.  Non-performance by our counterparties may force us to unwind hedges, and we may be unable to replace the hedge, thereby leaving the risk unhedged.  Under the terms of our hedging contracts, we are required to post collateral and to maintain a certain level of collateral, which may adversely affect our liquidity and could subject us to the credit risk of the counterparty to the extent it holds such collateral.  Changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute hedging strategies due to the increased economic cost of derivatives, primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements.

We are monitoring the developments surrounding the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) expected to occur in 2021.  We are continuing to evaluate the impact, if any, to our existing financial arrangements that extend past 2021 which primarily includes investments, derivatives, and debt agreements.

Currency translation could materially impact our reported operating results.

The functional currency of our U.K. and Polish operations is the British pound sterling and the Polish zloty, respectively.  Fluctuations in exchange rates have an effect on our reported financial results, which may be unfavorably impacted when the functional currency weakens.  However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency.  Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert our functional currency into dollars.  As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K or Poland.

See "Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits" contained herein in Item 1, "Critical Accounting Estimates" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7, "Interest Rate Risk" contained herein in Item 7A, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.


Insurance Risks

Actual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Historical results may not be indicative of future performance due to, among other things, changes in our mix of business, re-pricing of certain lines of business, or any number of economic cyclical effects on our business.  Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles, do not represent an exact calculation of future benefit liabilities but are instead estimates made by us using actuarial and statistical procedures.  Actual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions.  There can be no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all circumstances.  Future loss development may require reserves to be increased, which would adversely affect earnings in current and future periods.  Life expectancies may continue to increase, which could lengthen the time a claimant receives disability or long-term care benefits and could result in a change in mortality assumptions and an increase in reserves for these and other long-tailed products.  Adjustments to reserve amounts may also be required in the event of changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity (which represents the incidence of claims and the rate of recovery, including the effects thereon of inflation and other societal and economic factors); premium rate increases; persistency; policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits; and interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We provide a broad array of disability, long-term care, group life, and voluntary insurance products that are affected by many factors, and changes in any of those factors may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Disability Insurance

Disability insurance may be affected by a number of social, economic, governmental, competitive, and other factors.  Changes in societal attitudes, such as work ethic, motivation, or stability, can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products.

Both economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence and recoveries for disability insurance.  Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence.  Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may also be influenced by the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses.  Claim durations may be extended by medical improvements which could extend life expectancies.  The relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the insuring organization to price, underwrite, and adjudicate the claims.

Within the group disability market, pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates.  However, these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices.  In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time.  The pricing actions available in the individual disability market differ among product classes.  Our individual noncancelable disability policies, in which the policy is guaranteed to be renewable through the life of the policy at a fixed premium, do not permit us to adjust premiums on our in-force business.  Guaranteed renewable contracts that are not noncancelable can be re-priced to reflect adverse experience, but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as in the group disability market.

Long-term Care Insurance

Long-term care insurance can be affected by a number of demographic, medical, economic, governmental, competitive, and other factors.  Because long-term care insurance is a relatively new product for the insurance industry and is long-duration in nature, there is not as much historical data as is available for our other products.  This creates a level of uncertainty in properly pricing the product and using appropriate assumptions when establishing reserves.  Long-term care insurance is guaranteed renewable and can be re-priced to reflect adverse experience, but the re-pricing is subject to regulatory approval by our states of domicile and may also be subject to approval by jurisdictions in which our policyholders reside.  The rate approval process can affect the length of time in which the re-pricing can be implemented, if at all, and the rate increases ultimately approved may be unfavorable relative to assumptions used to establish our reserves.  We monitor our own experience and industry studies concerning morbidity, mortality, and policyholder terminations to understand emerging trends.  Changes in actual experience relative to our expectations may adversely affect our profitability and reserves.  To the extent mortality improves for the general population, and life expectancies increase, the period for which a claimant receives long-term care benefits may lengthen and the associated impact of advanced aging of policyholders may cause an increase in claims incidence.  Medical advances may


continue to have an impact on claim incidence and duration, both favorable and unfavorable.  Due to the long duration of the product, the timing and/or amount of our investment cash flows are difficult to match to those of our maturing liabilities.  Sustained periods of low or declining interest rates could result in increases in reserves and adversely affect our results of operations.

Group Life Insurance

Group life insurance may be affected by

the characteristics of the employees insured, the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily, our risk selection process, our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics, the geographical concentration of employees, and mortality rates.  Claim incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and pandemic health events, which may also affect the cost of and availability of reinsurance coverage.

Voluntary Products

Voluntary products sold in the workplace may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured, the level of employee participation and the amount of insurance the employees elect, our risk selection process, and our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics.  Our voluntary life insurance products generally include interest sensitive forms of insurance which contain a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate.  It is possible that our investment returns could be lower than the guaranteed crediting rate.  The non-life contracts are guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience, but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as for group disability and group life products.

We have assets which may not be fully recoverable or realizable, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

If our business does not perform well or as initially anticipated in our assumptions, we may be required to accelerate amortization or recognize an impairment loss on intangible assets or long-lived assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset.

We have intangible assets such as deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and goodwill.  DAC and VOBA are amortized based primarily upon expected future premium income of the related insurance policies.  Recoverability testing for DAC and VOBA is performed on an annual basis.  Insurance contracts are grouped on a basis consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring profitability of the contracts.  If recoverability testing indicates that either DAC and/or VOBA are not recoverable, the deficiency is charged to expense.

Goodwill is not amortized, but on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, we review the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment, considering in that review the financial performance and other relevant factors.  In accordance with accounting guidance, we test for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below.  In addition, certain events including, but not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment, an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency, or unanticipated competition would cause us to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually.

Long-lived assets, including assets such as real estate and information technology software, also may require impairment testing to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we may be unable to recover the carrying amount.

We assess our deferred tax assets to determine if they are realizable.  Factors in our determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate future taxable income.  If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to net income.

Charges such as accelerated amortization, impairment losses, or the establishment of valuation allowances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

See "Critical Accounting Estimates" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7, and Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.


Operational Risks

A cyber attack or other security breach could disrupt our operations, result in the unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential data, damage our reputation or relationships, and expose us to significant financial and legal liability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

We store confidential information about our business and our policyholders, employees, agents and others on our information technology systems, including proprietary and personally identifiable information.  As part of our normal business operations, we use this information and engage third-party providers, including outsourcing, cloud computing, and other business partners, that store, access, process, and transmit such information on our behalf.  We devote significant resources and employ security measures to help protect our information technology systems and confidential information, and we have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to information security incidents.  However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.  In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise our information security.  Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, or other cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering.

We and our third-party providers have experienced and likely will continue to experience information security incidents from time to time.  Although known incidents have not had a material effect on our business or financial condition, there is no assurance that our security systems and measures will be able to prevent, mitigate, or remediate future incidents that could have such an effect.  A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our information technology systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential information, harm to our brand or reputation, loss of customers and revenues, violations of privacy and other laws, and exposure to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement proceedings, fines, and potentially criminal proceedings and penalties.  If we are unaware of the incident for some time after it occurs, our exposure could increase.  In addition, the costs to address or remediate systems disruptions or security threats or vulnerabilities, whether before or after an incident, could be significant.  As we continue to build our digital capabilities and focus on enhancing the customer experience, the amount of information that we retain and share with third parties, as well as our reliance on them, is likely to grow, increasing the cost to prevent data security breaches and the cost and potential consequences of such breaches.  An information technology systems failure could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.  Further, successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants, whether or not we are affected, could lead to a general loss of customer and investor confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us.

Although we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits, are subject to deductibles or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies.

The failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a natural catastrophe, cyber attack, or other event could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, or financial condition.

In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an epidemic/pandemic, a cyber attack, cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure, a terrorist attack, or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data or result in a significant failure of our internal control environment.  In addition, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised.

The failure of our information technology and/or disaster recovery processes or systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers’ operations and result in the loss, theft, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers.  Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions, legal claims, and increased expenses, and lead to a loss of customers and revenues.


Our failure to develop digital capabilities or to effectively execute upgrades to or replacements of information technology systems could impair our ability to deliver on our growth initiatives or administer our business, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Our business plans increasingly rely on digital capabilities to meet or surpass customer expectations, simplify our operations, and deliver innovative product and service offerings.  If we are unable to effectively develop and offer digital capabilities that enhance our customers' experience, we may not fully achieve our strategic growth initiatives and may also experience the loss of existing business.  Although we believe we have information technology systems which adequately support our business needs, we continually upgrade our existing information technology systems and acquire or develop new systems to keep pace with the rapidly changing business and technology environment.  There are risks involved with upgrading or replacing information technology systems, including, but not limited to, data loss, data errors, and disruption to our operations.  We seek to monitor and control our exposure to the risks arising out of these activities through our risk control framework which encompasses a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes, and other mechanisms.

Unum Group depends on funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends.  The ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to Unum Group may be impaired by adverse financial results or a change in capital requirements.  Accordingly, internal sources of capital and liquidity may not always be sufficient.  If we need to seek external capital, adverse market conditions may affect our access to capital or our cost of capital.

Unum Group is a holding company for insurance and other subsidiaries and has limited operations of its own.  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds or other assets to affiliates, including to Unum Group.  The level of earnings and capital in our subsidiaries, as well as business conditions and rating agency considerations, could impact our insurance and other subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or to make other transfers of funds to Unum Group, which could impair our ability to pay dividends to Unum Group's common stockholders, meet our debt and other payment obligations, and/or repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock.  The use of funds held by Unum Group as consideration in any acquisition could affect our capital plan and render those funds unavailable for other corporate purposes.

A change in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations.  Deterioration in the credit market, which could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner, could also negatively impact our cash flows.  Regulatory changes such as those discussed herein in this Item 1A may impose higher capital or reserve requirements on our insurance subsidiaries, increase collateral requirements for certain of our derivatives transactions, and/or implement other requirements which could unfavorably affect our liquidity.  Without sufficient liquidity, our ability to maintain and grow our operations would be limited.  If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms, or at all, which may adversely affect us.

If our financial results are unfavorable, we may need to increase our capital in order to maintain our credit ratings or satisfy regulatory requirements.  Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus is considered important not only by us but by insurance regulatory authorities in the U.S., the PRA in the U.K., the KNF in Poland, and the rating agencies that rate insurers' claims-paying abilities and financial strength.  Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, action by regulatory authorities, or a downgrade by the rating agencies.  Need for additional capital may limit a subsidiary's ability to distribute funds to our holding companies.

Obtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be challenging in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty.  The markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers.  The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects.  Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us.  Raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through increased dilution of their common stock in Unum Group.

We rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity.  Our right to borrow funds under these facilities is subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default.  Our ability to borrow under these facilities are also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders to provide funds.  Our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments would restrict our ability to access these facilities when needed, with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.


See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1,"Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 8 and 15 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Our risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.

We have devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management program, which has the objective of managing our strategic, market, credit, insurance, and operations risks, which ultimately impact our reputational risk.  However, our program may not be comprehensive, and our methods for monitoring and managing risk may not fully predict or mitigate future exposures.  In this case, there may be a negative impact to our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

See "Regulation" contained herein Item 1, "Critical Accounting Estimates" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 1, 7 and 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.

See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" contained herein in Item 7A for further information about our risk management program.

General Risks

We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation.  Changes in laws and regulations that affect our industry or findings from examinations and investigations may affect the cost or demand for our products, increase capital and reserving requirements for our insurance subsidiaries, and adversely affect our profitability, liquidity, or growth.

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the United States and abroad.  The primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect policyholders, not stockholders.  To that end, applicable laws establish regulatory authorities, including state insurance departments in the United States, the PRA in the United Kingdom, and the KNF in Poland, with broad administrative powers over many aspects of the insurance business.  For example, our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations, or may be able to do so only at great cost.  In addition, we and our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and insurance holding companies.  These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to differing interpretations and are regularly re-examined.  Existing or future laws and regulations, and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.  For example, they may restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us, restrict transactions between subsidiaries and/or between us and our subsidiaries, and may require contributions of capital by us to our insurance subsidiaries even if we are otherwise in compliance with stated requirements.  Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws or regulations could result in restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which they operate and could result in fines and other sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Regulatory examinations or investigations could result in, among other things, an increase to reserving requirements, changes in our claims handling or other business practices, changes in procedures for the identification and payment to the states of benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners, changes in the use and oversight of reinsurance, changes in governance and other oversight procedures, assessments by tax authorities or other governing agencies, fines, and other administrative action, which could injure our reputation, adversely affect our issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings, place us at a competitive disadvantage in marketing or administering our products, impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies, and/or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

It is possible that there will be heightened oversight of insurers by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and operate.  We cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  For instance, the NAIC or state regulators may adopt further revisions to the RBC formula, the PRA may revise its capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins, the IAIS may adopt capital requirements to which we could be subject, or rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses, thus requiring additional capital contributions by us to our insurance subsidiaries.  Increased financial services regulation, which could include activities undertaken by the NAIC and regulatory authorities in the U.K., Poland, and the EU may impose greater quantitative


requirements, supervisory review, and disclosure requirements and may impact the business strategies, capital requirements, and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries.  The United Kingdom's Financial Ombudsman Service, which was established to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses providing financial services, and the FCA, which has rule-making, investigative, and enforcement powers to protect consumers, may hamper our ability to do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. operations.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, which are periodically revised and/or expanded.  Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies within these countries, which may also be influenced by the International Accounting Standards Board.  Future accounting standards we adopt, including the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board's accounting standard update related to long-duration targeted improvements for insurance contracts, will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our financial statements.  Such changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition and may also impact the perception of our business by external stakeholders.

We use affiliated captive reinsurers for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency.  If we were required to discontinue use of the captive reinsurers or to alter the structure of the captive reinsurance arrangements, our ability to maintain current RBC ratios and/or our capital deployment activities could be adversely affected.

Changes in U.S. programs such as healthcare reform, the emergence of paid family and medical leave legislation, and financial services sector reform may compete with or diminish the need or demand for our products, particularly as it may affect our ability to sell our products through employers or in the workplace.  The U.S. social security disability insurance program may not be sustainable, which may adversely affect the level of our disability claim payments and reserves.  Legislative changes related to pension funding requirements could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our profitability.

Changes in tax laws and other regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could unfavorably impact our corporate taxes.  In addition, changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to consumers.

On January 31, 2020, an official bill was passed formalizing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU.  The bill gives approval to an 11-month transition period, until December 31, 2020, to allow for further negotiations regarding the details of the future relationship.  Although we do not expect the withdrawal to have a significant direct impact on the underlying operations of our U.K. business, disruption and uncertainty associated with the withdrawal may continue to dampen economic growth in the U.K., and correspondingly, the earnings of our U.K. business.  We may experience volatility in the fair values of our investments in U.K. and EU-based issuers, but we do not expect a material increase in other-than-temporary impairments or defaults, nor do we believe this volatility will impact our ability to hold these investments.  We may also experience higher claims incidence in the near term, which is generally correlated to periods of economic uncertainty.  Additionally, it is possible that there are tax impacts associated with the exit such as revised or new tax regulations.  The continued dampening of growth due to the current disruption and uncertainty in the U.K. economy may lead to lower near-term sales and premium growth.  There are currently no indications that capital requirements for our U.K. operations will change, but economic conditions may cause volatility in our solvency ratios.  Our reported consolidated financial results may continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate.

Most group long-term and short-term disability plans we administer are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  Changes to ERISA enacted by Congress or through judicial interpretations may adversely affect the risk to us of managing employee benefit plans, increase the premiums associated with such plans, and ultimately affect their affordability and our profitability.

The insurance departments in jurisdictions wherein our insurance subsidiaries conduct business may limit our ability to obtain rate increases under guaranteed renewable contracts or could require changes in rates and/or benefits to meet minimum loss ratio requirements which could negatively impact the profitability of our products.  Many regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees.  These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices are improper.  These actions could result in substantial fines or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  Determination by regulatory authorities that we have engaged in improper conduct may also adversely affect our defense of various lawsuits.


A decrease in our financial strength or issuer credit ratings may adversely affect our competitive position, our ability to hedge our risks, and our cost of capital or ability to raise capital, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

We compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies.  A downgrade of our financial strength ratings may adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete.  A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise additional capital.  If we are downgraded significantly, ratings triggers in our derivatives financial instrument contracts may result in our counterparties enforcing their option to terminate the derivative contracts.  Such an event may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to hedge our risks.

Competition may adversely affect our market share or profitability.

All of our businesses are highly competitive.  We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price, the quality of our customer's experience regarding service and claims management, integrated product choices, enrollment capabilities, financial strength, and claims-paying ratings.  We compete for new product sales, the retention of existing business, and the ability to attract and retain independent agents and brokers to market our products, all of which affect our profitability.  All areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of the group products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market.  There is a risk that our customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms or improved technology solutions from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us, particularly if industry pricing levels do not align with our view of adequate premium rates.  We are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and non-traditional competitors, with changes in product offerings, enrollment capabilities, and technology solutions.  The level and intensity of competition may also grow due to existing competitors becoming more aggressive, and an increase in merger and acquisition activity which may result in larger competitors with greater financial resources.  There are many insurance companies which actively compete with us in our lines of business, and there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies and new competitors in the future.

Events that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

There are many events which may harm our reputation, including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Item 1A regarding regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, and cyber or other information security incidents.

In addition, being in the business of insurance, we are paid to accept certain risks.  Those who conduct business on our behalf, including executive officers and members of management, sales managers, investment professionals, and to some extent, independent agents and brokers, do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk.  These include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline, maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance, managing our investment portfolio and derivatives trading activities, delivering effective technology solutions, complying with established sales practices, executing our capital management strategy, exiting a line of business and/or pursuing strategic growth initiatives, and other decisions.  Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective.  If our employees and business associates take excessive risks and/or fail to comply with internal policies and practices, the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation.

Depending on the severity of the damage to our reputation, we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  Damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital and/or increase our cost of capital.

Litigation and contingencies are common in our businesses and may result in financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.

We are, and in the future may be, defendants in a number of litigation matters, and the outcome of this litigation is uncertain.  Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants.  Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages.  An estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  An adverse outcome in one or more of these actions may, depending on the nature, scope and amount of the ruling,


materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, encourage other litigation, and limit our ability to write new business, particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact certain of our ratings.

As part of our normal operations in managing claims, we are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits.  Typically those lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder, and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims.  For our general claim litigation, we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course.  We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to general claim litigation, after consideration of the reserves maintained, will not be material to our financial condition.  Nevertheless, given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages may, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  We are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible punitive losses.

Executive Summary

2019 Operating Performance and Capital Management

For 2019, we reported net income of $1,100.3 million, or $5.24 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $523.4 million, or $2.38 per diluted common share, in 2018.  Net income includes net realized investment gains and losses.  Included in our results for 2019 are costs related to the early retirement of debt of $27.3 million before tax and $21.6 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted common share.  Included in our 2018 results is a reserve increase related to our long-term care block of business of $750.8 million before tax and $593.1 million after tax, or $2.70 per diluted common share.  Adjusting for these items, after-tax adjusted operating income for 2019 was $1,140.6 million, or $5.44 per diluted common share compared to $1,145.0 million, or $5.20 per diluted common share for 2018.  See "Long-term Care Reserve Increase, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures," and "Consolidated Operating Results" contained herein in this Item 7 for further discussion and a reconciliation of these items.

Our Unum US segment reported an increase in adjusted operating income

of 1.6 percent in


compared to


, with growth in premium income, partially offset by lower net investment income and higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs.  Th

e benefit ratio for our Unum US segment for 2019 was 66.9 percent

, compared to

67.2 percent in 2018.

Unum US sales decreased 0.4 percent in 2019 compared to 2018.  Persistency in our group product lines was stable while persistency in our supplemental and voluntary product lines was less favorable.

Our Unum International segment reported a decrease in adjusted operating incom

e

of 5.3 percent in 2019 compared to 2018

, as measured in U.S. dollars.  Our Unum UK line of business reported a decrease in adjusted operating income of 4.3 percent   compared to 2018

, as measured in local currency, due primarily to unfavorable benefits experience, partially offset by an increase in premium income and net investment income.  The benefit ratio for our Unum UK line of business was 76.7 percent in 2019 compared to 74.4 percent in 2018.  Unum International sales, as measured in U.S. dollars, increased 14.9 percent in 2019 compared to 2018.  Unum UK sales, as measured in local currency, increased 8.5 percent in 2019 compared to 2018.  Persistency was higher overall relative to the prior year.

Our Colonial Life segment reported an increase in adjusted operating income of 2.8 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 due to growth in premium income, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs and lower net investment income.  The 2019 benefit ratio for Colonial Life was 51.3 percent, which was generally consistent with 51.4 percent in 2018.  Colonial Life sales increased 0.8 percent in 2019 compared to 2018.  Persistency was lower relative to the prior year.

Our Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $137.7 million in 2019.  In 2018, our Closed Block segment reported a loss of $625.3 million.  Excluding the 2018 long-term care reserve increase, adjusted operating income for this segment was $125.5 million in 2018.  The increase in adjusted operating income in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to an increase in net investment income and overall favorable benefits experience, partially offset by lower premium income.  The long-term care interest adjusted loss ratio for 2019 was not comparable to 2018 due to the update in our assumptions during the third quarter of 2018, but was within our range of expectations.  Benefits experience for individual disability was favorable in 2019 compared to 2018 and remains within our expectations.

Our net investment income yields continue to be pressured by the low interest rate environment as we maintain consistent credit quality in our invested asset portfolio.  The net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2018, with the increase due primarily to a decline in U.S. Treasury rates and credit spreads during 2019.  The earned book yield on our investment portfolio was 5.00 percent for 2019 compared to a yield of 5.15 percent for 2018.

We believe our capital and financial positions are strong.  At December 31, 2019, the RBC ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was approximately 365 percent, which is in line with our expectations.  During 2019, we repurchased 12.3 million shares of Unum Group common stock under our share repurchase program, at a cost of approximately $400 million.  Our weighted average


common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, equaled 209.9 million for 2019 compared to 220.1 million for 2018, reflecting our capital management strategy of returning capital to shareholders through repurchases of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2019, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies held fixed maturity securities, short-term investments, and cash of $863 million.

2018 Long-term Care Reserve Increase

Policy reserves for our long-term care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and, prior to the third quarter of 2018, were valued based on assumptions established as of December 31, 2014, the date of our last assumption update under loss recognition.  Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient.  We undertake a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review.

During the third quarter of 2018, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions.  The review utilized internal and external data and outside consulting firms for quality assurance and industry benchmarking.  Based on our analysis, during the third quarter of 2018, we updated our reserve assumptions and determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $750.8 million, or $593.1 million after-tax, to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations.  This increase was primarily driven by the update to our liability and interest rate assumptions, particularly claims incidence and claim termination rates, which resulted in an increase to reserves of approximately $2.2 billion.  Partially offsetting the increase was the update to our assumptions for premium rate increases which decreased reserves approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in the net increase to reserves of $750.8 million.  See "Trends in Key Assumptions" contained herein in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" of this Item 7 for further discussion of the assumptions used in our long-term care reserve update.

2018 Acquisitions of Business

In November 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Jaimini Health, Inc. (Jaimini Health), a dental health maintenance organization.  The acquisition of Jaimini Health will broaden our employee benefit dental offerings in the U.S., particularly in the state of California and is reported in our Unum US segment.

In October 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Pramerica Zycie TUiR S.A. (which we have subsequently renamed Unum Zycie TUiR S.A. and refer to as Unum Poland), a financial protection benefits provider in Poland.  This acquisition will expand our European presence, which we believe to be an attractive market for financial protection benefits.

In January 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Leavelogic, Inc (Leavelogic), a leave management technology provider.  The acquisition of Leavelogic will enhance our current leave management offerings by providing tools for employers and employees to better manage the family leave process and is reported in our Unum US segment.

See Note 13 of the " Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained herein in Item 8 for further details.

Unclaimed Death Benefits (UDB) Reserve Increase

Similar to other insurers, we were the subject of an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states.  We cooperated fully with this examination and in the fourth quarter of 2017, we started the process to reach a Global Resolution Agreement with the third party regarding settlement of the examination, which we finalized in January of 2018.  Under the terms of the agreement, the third party acting on behalf of the signatory states compared insured data to the Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify deceased insureds and contract holders where a valid claim has not been made.  During the fourth quarter of 2017, we established reserves which reflected our estimate of the liability expected to be paid as we execute on the terms of the settlement.  Claim reserves were increased $18.5 million for Unum US group life, $8.1 million for Unum US voluntary life, and $12.4 million for Colonial Life voluntary life, for a total reserve increase of $39.0 million before tax and $25.4 million after tax.


U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, more commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).  The TCJA, among other things, included a reduction to the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits (Deemed Repatriation Tax) at reduced rates.  As a result of these changes, we recognized a tax benefit of $97.9 million in 2017 related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with our U.S. operations to the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rate and a tax expense of $66.4 million resulting from the Deemed Repatriation Tax.  See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1 and Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further details.

U.K. Referendum

On January 31, 2020, an official bill was passed formalizing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU.  The bill gives approval to an 11- month transition period, until December 31, 2020, to allow for further negotiations regarding the details of the future relationship.

We do not expect that the underlying operations of our U.K. business to be significantly impacted by the withdrawal but we may see some continued dampening of growth in the U.K. as well as earnings volatility due to the current disruption and uncertainty in the U.K. economy.  We may also experience volatility in the fair values of our investments in U.K. and EU-based issuers, but we do not expect a material increase in other-than-temporary impairments or defaults, nor do we believe this volatility will impact our ability to hold these investments.  There are currently no indications that capital requirements for our U.K. operations will change, but economic conditions may cause volatility in our solvency ratios.  Our reported consolidated financial results may continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate.  See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1, "Risk Factors" contained herein Item 1A, and "Unum International Segment" contained herein this Item 7.

Consolidated Company Outlook for 2020

We believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength as we seek to capitalize on the growing and largely unfilled need for our products and services.  We believe the need for our products and services remains strong, and we intend to continue protecting our solid margins and returns through our pricing and risk management actions.  Our strategy is centered on growing our existing business, expanding our reach, and investing in our operations and technology to anticipate and respond to new market demands to meet the changing needs of our customers.

We expect a continuation of the positive operating trends in our core businesses during 2020, with solid premium growth, consistent risk management, and a continued focus on operational efficiencies.

The low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields as well as discount rates on our insurance liabilities.  Our reported consolidated financial results may also continue to be unfavorably impacted by political and economic uncertainty in the U.K., specifically lower interest rates, wage inflation, employer spending, and claims volatility.

We continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate the current environment and allow us to maintain solid operating margins and significant financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses, while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders and exploring merger and acquisition opportunities to enhance our business lines.  The continued strong labor market in the U.S. and the high level of consumer confidence will have positive impacts on our business.  We have substantial leverage to rising interest rates and an improving economy which generates payroll growth and wage inflation.  We believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our long-term financial objectives.

Further discussion is included in "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," "Consolidated Operating Results," "Segment Results," "Investments," and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained herein in this Item 7 and in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.


Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP financial measure of "after-tax adjusted operating income" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below.  We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments.  Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses.  Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals.  We exclude these items as we believe them to be infrequent or unusual in nature, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.

See "Executive Summary" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 6, 7, 8, and 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion regarding the impacts of the long-term care reserve increase, the TCJA, the unclaimed death benefit reserve increase, cost related to the early retirement of debt,  and the loss from a guaranty fund assessment, respectively.

A reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to our non-GAAP financial measures is as follows:


We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below.  These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income.

A reconciliation of total revenue to "adjusted operating revenue" and income before income tax to "adjusted operating income" is as follows:


Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes.  Estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements.  The accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits, deferred acquisition costs, valuation of investments, pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, and contingent liabilities.  For additional information, refer to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits

Reserves for policy and contract benefits are our largest liabilities and represent claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders.  The two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us.  Reserves for policy and contract benefits equaled $43.7 billion and $43.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, or approximately 76.6 percent and 81.3 percent of our total liabilities, respectively.  Reserves ceded to reinsurers were $7.2 billion a

t both De

cember 31, 2019 and 2018 and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets.

Policy Reserves

Policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums, allowing a margin for expenses and profit.  These reserves relate primarily to our non-interest sensitive products, including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our Unum US segment; individual disability and life products in our Unum International segment; disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our Colonial Life segment; and individual disability, long-term care, and other products in our Closed Block segment.  The reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate (i.e. loss recognition occurs).

•

Persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations.

•

Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations.

•

Discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns.

In establishing policy reserves, we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience, which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation.  We do not, however, establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions.

We perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test, without a provision for adverse deviation.  We group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests.  If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency.  Thereafter, the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing, referred to as the gross premium valuation method, wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation (loss recognition) date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive.

Because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency, mortality and morbidity, and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time, policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance.  Depending on the funding mechanism, a full policy reserve is held during disability reflecting continued funding of the full policy reserve during a disability claim, or a fractional policy reserve is held reflecting that the individual policyholder would need to recover before he or she can again generate future claims for a separate occurrence.  The policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders either reach the terminal age for coverage, die, or voluntarily lapse the policy.  Policy reserves for Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life products are determined using the net


level premium method as prescribed by GAAP.  In applying this method, we use, as applicable by product type, morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions, claim resolution rate assumptions, and policy persistency assumptions, among others, to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income.  We then apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive, with a provision for profit allowed.

Policy reserves for our Closed Block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability, individual and group long-term care, and certain other products, all of which are no longer actively marketed.  The reserves for individual disability and individual and group long-term care are determined using the gross premium valuation method.  Key assumptions are persistency, mortality and morbidity, claim incidence, claim resolution rates, commission rates, and maintenance expense rates.  For long-term care, premium rate increases are also a key assumption.  We apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive, with no provision for future profit.  The interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business.  Under the gross premium valuation method, we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions.  Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient in the future.

Policy reserves for certain other products, excluding individual disability and individual and group long-term care, which are no longer actively marketed and are reported in our Closed Block segment represent $5.8 billion on a gross basis.  We have ceded $5.1 billion of reserves related to the other products, which are primarily comprised of policy reserves, to reinsurers.  The ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable.  We continue to service a block of group pension products, which we have not ceded, and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates.  Expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities.

Claim Reserves

Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) to us and, as prescribed by GAAP, equals our long-term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses.  A claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim, such as the benefits available under the applicable policy, the covered benefit period, the age, and, as appropriate, the occupation and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits.  Reserves for IBNR claims, similar to incurred claim reserves, include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates, but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims, these reserves are also established based on historical incidence rate assumptions, including claim reporting patterns, the average cost of claims, and the expected volumes of incurred claims.  Our incurred claim reserves and IBNR claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions.

Claim reserves, unlike policy reserves, are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change.  Each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate.  If we believe, based on our actual experience and our view of future events, that our long-term assumptions need to be modified, we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income.

Multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages.  Available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method, the paid loss development method, the incurred loss development method, the count and severity method, and the expected claim cost method.  No single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines.  The estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves.

We use a tabular reserve methodology on reported claims for our Unum US group long-term disability and individual disability claims as well as for our Closed Block individual disability and group and individual long-term care claims.  Under the tabular reserve methodology, reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants, such as age, length of time disabled, and medical diagnosis, as well as assumptions regarding claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets.  We believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long-term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim.  IBNR claim reserves for our long-term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs.  For Unum US group short-term disability products, an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted, as well as on


IBNR claims, is determined in aggregate using a paid loss development method rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for reported claims on long-term products.  The average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long-term liabilities and results in less estimation variability.

Claim reserves for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid, IBNR death claims, and a liability for waiver of premium benefits.  The death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid, the IBNR reserve is calculated using the paid loss development method, and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology.

Claim reserves supporting the group and individual dental and vision products reported in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments have a short claim payout period.  As a result, the reserves, which primarily represent IBNR and a small amount of claims pending payment, are calculated using the paid loss development method.

Claim reserves supporting our Unum International segment are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for Unum US disability and group term life reserves.  Claim reserves for our Unum UK group dependent life product are calculated using discounted cash flows, based on our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates.  The assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this segment are based on standard country-specific industry experience, adjusted for our own experience.

The majority of the Colonial Life segment lines of business have short-term benefits, which generally have less estimation variability than our long-term products because of the shorter claim payout period.  Our claim reserves for Colonial Life's lines of business are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience.  The incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date.  Where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate, we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure.  The key assumptions for claim reserves for the Colonial Life segment lines of business are the timing, rate, and amount of estimated future claim payments; and the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims.


The following table displays policy reserves, incurred claim reserves, and IBNR claim reserves by major product line, with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable.  Incurred claim reserves represent the expected benefits payable under each incurred claim, along with other expenses associated with the payment of the claims.  IBNR claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products.  The IBNR and reopened claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring.  Impacting year over year comparability of policy and claim reserves in the following chart is the 2018 long-term care reserve increase.  See "Executive Summary" contained herein in this Item 7 and Note 6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.


Key Assumptions

The calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions, but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are (1) the discount rate, (2) the claim resolution rate, and (3) the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves.  Of these assumptions, our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time.

1.

The

discount rate

, which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value.  A higher discount rate produces a lower reserve.  If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments.  In this case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient.  We set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions.  If the investment yield on new investments that are purchased differs from the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio, the discount rate assumption on claims may be adjusted to reflect the impact of the new investment yield.

2.

The

claim resolution rate

, used for both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the probability that a disability or long-term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured.  It is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim.  Estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time.  Claim resolution assumptions involve many factors, including the cause of disability, the policyholder's age, the type of contractual benefits provided, and the time since initial disability.  We primarily use our own


claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions.  These assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability.  Our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years, with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years.  We also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience.

3.

The

incidence rate

, used for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves, is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us.  The incidence rate is affected by many factors, including the age of the insured, the insured's occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment.  We establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations.

Establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors.  Reserves, particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long-term disabilities and long-term care, are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion.  The impact of internal and external events, such as changes in claims operational procedures, economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, new trends and developments in medical treatments, and legal trends and legislative changes, including changes to social security and other government-based welfare benefits programs which provide policy benefit offsets, among other factors, will influence claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, and claim costs.  In addition, for policies offering coverage for disability or long-term care at advanced ages, the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs.  Reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line.  Additionally, in any period and over time, our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long-term assumptions, either singularly or collectively, and these variances may offset each other.  We test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long-term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time.  Therefore, while it is possible to evaluate the sensitivity of overall adequacy results in our reserves based upon a change in each individual assumption, the actual impacts of changes to a variety of underlying assumptions must be considered in the aggregate by product line in order to judge the overall potential implications to reserve adequacy.  The following section presents an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions, in aggregate, for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for, either favorable or unfavorable.

Trends in Key Assumptions

Generally, we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time.  We have historically experienced an increase in our group long-term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period and believe claim incidence trends may continue to somewhat follow general economic conditions and demographics of the general workforce.

Claim incidence rates for Unum US group long-te

rm disability were generally consistent in 2019 compared to the prior year.

In 2019, both short-term and long-term interest rates decreased.  The long-term interest rates supporting the majority of our lines of business remain below historical norms.  The assumptions we used

to discount reserves during this period were slightly lower for certain of our product lines.  Reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims are periodically adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns.  Changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long-duration investment portfolios which support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business.

Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably.  Claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions.  These rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately.  Claim resolution rates in our Unum US group long-term disability product line and in our Closed Block individual disability product line have exhibited some variability over the last several years.  Relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business, actual quarterly rates during 2018 and 2019 have varied between +8 and -12 percent in our Closed Block individual disability line of business.  Actual quarterly rates during 2018 and 2019 have varied by +3 and -3 percent in our Unum US group long-term disability line of business.  Claim resolution rates


for our group long-term disability product line have generally exhibited an increasing trend.  On an annual basis for the years 2017 to 2019, our overall claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our long-term assumptions.

We monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate.  In our estimation, scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions, when modeled together in aggregate, could produce potential results as illustrated in the chart below.  The major contributor to the variance for both the Unum US group long-term disability line of business and the Closed Block individual disability line of business is the claim resolution rate.

In addition to our Unum US group long-term disability and Closed Block individual disability lines of business, we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to long-term care policy reserves.  These reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method with assumptions established during the third quarter of 2018, the date of the latest loss recognition.  Assumptions for policy reserves do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient.  As such, positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin, while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge.  Policy reserves for long-term care are based upon a number of key assumptions, and each assumption has various factors which may impact the long-term outcome.  Key assumptions with respect to morbidity, mortality, claims incidence and resolutions, persistency, interest rates, and future premium rate increases must incorporate extended views of expectations for many years into the future.  Reserves are highly sensitive to these estimates.

During the third quarter of 2018, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy for our long-term care line of business, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions.  The review utilized internal and external data and outside consulting firms for quality assurance and industry benchmarking.  Based on our analysis, we updated our reserve assumptions as discussed in the following paragraphs.  In addition, we have also included a sensitivity analysis for these assumptions for both favorable and unfavorable deviations applied throughout the entire life of the block.  This sensitivity analysis was completed as of the date of our assumption update announcement in the third quarter of 2018 and will not be updated unless reserves are again determined to be deficient in the future.

•

We updated our active policy termination assumptions, which are affected by both policyholder mortality and lapses.  We aligned our mortality assumptions with industry data based on a 2012 individual annuitant mortality industry table, adjusted for our experience in earlier policy durations.  We also lowered our lapse assumptions for individual policies based on emerging company experience, which resulted in an ultimate lapse rate of 0.25 percent.  A six percent unfavorable change in the active policy termination assumption would result in approximately a $330 million decrease to reserve margin and a six percent favorable change would result in approximately a $320 million increase to reserve margin.

•

We updated our claims incidence assumptions to consider both the elevated claim levels that we have recently experienced as well as longer term experience based on our analysis of numerous claim factors, including variations by age, gender, product, premium funding method, and other factors.  A 2.5 percent unfavorable change in the claim incidence assumption would result in approximately a $290 million decrease to reserve margin and a 2.5 percent favorable change would result in approximately a $300 million increase to reserve margin.

•

We updated our claim termination assumptions, which are primarily affected by the death, and to a lesser extent, the recovery of the insured to largely reflect our experience.  A three percent unfavorable change in the claim termination assumption would result in approximately a $370 million decrease to reserve margin and a three percent favorable change would result in approximately a $360 million increase to reserve margin.

•

We have observed morbidity improvement in our own claims experience over a ten year period of approximately three percent per year, normalized for variables such as age and claim type.  However, we believe that a longer-term view is the best way to evaluate this type of improvement.  Accordingly, we updated our morbidity assumptions reflect minor improvement, one percent per year, including a partially offsetting assumption of 0.6 percent per year mortality improvement.  If no improvement occurs in the morbidity and mortality assumptions, reserve margin would decrease by approximately $1 billion.  If a three percent per year improvement in the morbidity and mortality assumptions occurs, reserve margin would increase by approximately $1.6 billion.


•

We updated our premium rate increase assumptions to reflect both our estimate of previously filed rate increases, informed by our historical approval rates, and our anticipated future rate filings.  The impact of the update to the premium rate increase assumptions resulted in approximately a $1.4 billion decrease to reserves, of which approximately $700 million relates to currently outstanding requests pending approval with the remaining $700 million related to future rate increase submissions, with a focus on group policies, that will be completed and filed during the next several quarters.  A ten percent change in the remaining premium rate increase success rate assumption would result in an approximately $140 million change in reserve margin depending on whether the change was favorable or unfavorable.

•

We updated our discount rate assumption to reflect our expectation for the low interest rate environment to persist and our expected impact on future long-term care new money yield rates.  Our updated expectation for long-term care new money yield rates assumes a rate of 5.5 percent through 2021 and then a gradual increase to 6.25 percent by 2025, when we assume no further increase.  A 0.25 percent change in the new money yield rate assumption would result in an approximately $250 million change in reserve margin depending on whether the change was favorable or unfavorable.  Alternatively, a 0.25 percent change in the overall assumed discount rate, which includes the new money yield rate assumption, would impact the reserve margin within an approximate range of $450 million to $500 million, assuming all other factors held constant.

Key assumptions and related impacts are also heavily interrelated in both their outcome and in their effects on reserves.  For example, changes in the view of morbidity and mortality might be mitigated by either potential future premium rate increases and/or morbidity improvements due to general improvement in health and/or medical breakthroughs.  There is potentially a wide range of outcomes for each assumption and in totality.

We believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions, in the aggregate, could result in a material impact on our reserve levels, but we record our reserves based on our long-term best estimate.  Because these product lines have long-term claim payout periods, there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs, either positive or negative.  We closely monitor emerging experience and use these results to inform our view of long-term assumptions.

Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC)

We defer incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and amortize these costs over the life of the related policies.  Deferred costs include certain commissions, other agency compensation, selection and policy issue expenses, and field expenses.  Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral.

Approximately 89.4 percent of our DAC relates to non-interest sensitive products, and we amortize DAC for these products in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies.  DAC related to interest sensitive policies is amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins.  Key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of DAC are persistency, premium income, and for our interest sensitive products, mortality margins and investment returns.  We use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining our assumptions.  For non-interest sensitive products, the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years, which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy.  Our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during 2019 did not change materially from those used in 2018.  Generally, we do not expect our key assumptions to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time.


The following are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods, the approximate DAC balance that remains at the end of years 3, 10, and 15 as a percentage of the cost initially deferred, and our DAC balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Amortization of DAC is adjusted to reflect actual experience for assumptions which deviate compared to the anticipated experience.  Any deviations from projections may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur.  As an example, for our non-interest sensitive products, we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected, or we may experience a slower rate of amortization if policies persist longer than projected.  Our actual experience has not varied materially from our assumptions during the last three years.

See Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our DAC accounting policy.

Fair Value of Investments

All of our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, and all of our unrestricted equity securities are reported at fair value.  Our derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.  We report our investments in private equity partnerships at our share of the partnerships' net asset value per share or its equivalent (NAV), as a practical expedient for fair value.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price, not an entry price.  The exit price objective applies regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date.  We generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach.  The market approach


uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and the income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount.  We believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the types of investments we hold.

The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability.  Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value.  The market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades, price quotes from third party pricing vendors, price quotes we obtain from outside brokers, discounted cash flow, and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.  Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs.

Inputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.  We use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments.  Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources.  Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity.  For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value.  We consider key assumptions, such as risk-free interest rates and risk premium adjustments, in the valuation of these types of securities.  Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities.  Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk-free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 9.9 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as Level 1, 88.6 percent as Level 2, and 1.5 percent as Level 3.  Level 1 is the highest category of the three-level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  The Level 2 category includes assets or liabilities valued using inputs (other than those included in the Level 1 category) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.  The Level 3 category is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.

Rapidly changing credit and equity market conditions can materially impact the valuation of securities, and the period to period changes in value can vary significantly.

See Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.


Investment Impairments

One of the significant estimates related to investments is our impairment valuation.  In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, we evaluate the following factors:

•

Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security

•

Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis

•

Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments

•

The significance of the decline in value

•

The time period during which there has been a significant decline in value

•

Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings

•

The valuation of the security’s underlying collateral

•

Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles

•

Market conditions

•

Rating agency and governmental actions

•

Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity

•

Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments

•

Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date

•

Any other key measures for the related security

We evaluate available information, including the factors noted above, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions.  In particular, we also consider the strength of the issuer’s balance sheet, its debt obligations and near term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets.  Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary.  The significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.

While determining other-than-temporary impairments is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period.  The process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other-than-temporary impairment.

We use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation.  Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  We establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans, considering the value of the underlying collateral, the value of which is periodically assessed.  Mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is considered impaired, in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income.


There are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary.  These risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities:

•

The assessment of a borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations will change.

•

The economic outlook, either domestic or foreign, may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated, and as such, the investment may not recover in value.

•

New information may become available concerning the security, such as disclosure of accounting irregularities, fraud, or corporate governance issues.

•

Significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry.

•

Significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased.

•

Adverse rating agency actions may occur.

See Notes 1 and 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans.  The U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and benefit cost.  We maintain a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees in our U.K. operation.  The U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants on December 31, 2013, the OPEB plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2012, and the U.K. plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2002.

Assumptions

Our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience.  Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount (interest) rate, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and mortality rates.  We also use, as applicable, expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate, and the U.K. pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefits.

The assumptions chosen for our pension and OPEB plans are reviewed annually, using a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.  The discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality rate assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans.  In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and OPEB plans may change due to factors such as plan amendments, actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, and/or changes in benefits provided under the plans.

•

Discount rate

- This interest assumption is based on the yield derived from a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments that reasonably match the timing and amounts of projected future benefits for each of our retirement-related benefit plans.  The rate is determined at the measurement date.  A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our net periodic benefit cost.

•

Long-term rate of return

- This assumption is selected from a range of probable return outcomes from an analysis of the asset portfolio.  The market-related value as it relates to our estimate of long-term rate of return equals the fair value of plan assets, determined as of the measurement date.  The return on plan assets recognizes all asset gains and losses, including changes in fair value, through the measurement date.  Our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance, evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists, and current market yields.  The expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan's strategic asset allocation.  The actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and benefit payments.  A lower long-term rate of return on plan assets increases our net periodic benefit cost.

Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.  Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.  We believe our investment portfolios are well


diversified by asset class and sector, with no undue risk concentrations in any one category.  See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of the investment portfolios for our plans.

•

Mortality rate

- This assumption reflects our best estimate, as of the measurement date, of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments.  We derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables.

The weighted average assumptions

used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

The following illustrates the sensitivity of the below items to a 50 basis point change in the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets:

Benefit Obligation and Fair Value of Plan Assets

During 2019, the fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan increased $145.1 million, or 10.0 percent due to a favorable return on assets which resulted in a gain of approximately 19.4 percent, partially offset by the payment of benefits and expenses.  The fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan increased £20.5 million, or 12.1 percent, due primarily to a favorable return on assets which resulted in a gain of approximately 14.2 percent.  Although our rate of return on plan assets for 2019 exceeded our assumptions used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit costs, we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment and our expectations for the future investment returns based on the plan's asset allocation.

As of December 31, 2019, our pension and OPEB plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of $747.4 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of $2.1 million, which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense.  The unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans, which is $758.5 million at December 31, 2019, will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan, which is approximatel

y 26 years for the U.S. plan and 32 years for the U.K. plan, to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent corridor, as described below.  The

unrecognized net actuarial gain of $11.1 million for our OPEB plan will be amortized over the average future working life of OPEB plan participants, estimated at

three

years, to the extent the gain is outside of the corridor.  The corridor for the pension and OPEB plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation.  At December 31, 2019, $484.8 million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the U.S. plans and £28.3 million was outside of the corridor for the U.K. plan.  At December 31, 2019, none of the actuarial gain was outside of the corridor for the OPEB plan.

The amortization of the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and the unrecognized prior service credit is a component of our net periodic benefit cost and equaled $18.4 million, $22.1 million, and $19.6 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.


The fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was $1,600.0 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $1,454.9 million at December 31, 2018.  The plan was in an underfunded position of $300.8 million and $294.2 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.  This year-over-year change was due primarily to the increase in period benefit obligations due to the decrease in discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns.

The fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan was £190.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to £170.2 million at December 31, 2018.  The U.K. pension plan was in an underfunded position of £3.1 million at December 31, 2019 and an overfunded position of £4.7 million at December 31, 2018.   This year-over-year change was due primarily to the increase in period benefit obligations due to the decrease in discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns.

The fair value of plan assets in our OPEB plan was $9.9 million and $10.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  These assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our OPEB plan.  Our OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and dental benefits.  It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan.

See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Income Taxes

We provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions.  The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign.  The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  Significant judgment is required in determining valuation allowances.  In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  In the event we determine that we most likely will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.  Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed.

In establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions are made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained.  GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.  The evaluation of a tax position is a two step process.  The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position.  The second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met.  Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.

If a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured, the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective.

Changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on our provision for income tax and our effective tax rate, which could significantly affect the amounts reported in our financial statements.  The TCJA did not significantly change our process for evaluating the above items.

In connection with the TCJA, we recognized a tax benefit of $97.9 million in 2017 related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with our U.S. operations to the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rate and a tax expense of $66.4 million resulting from the tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits.  During 2018, we continued to refine our calculations during the one-year measurement period after the enactment date as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and increased our provisional Repatriation Tax estimate by $11.5 million to $77.9 million.


See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1.  See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Contingent Liabilities

On a quarterly basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  It is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending, in part, on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period.  See Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Accounting Developments

For information on new accounting standards and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.


Consolidated Operating Results

Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar for our U.K. operations, have an effect on our consolidated financial results.  In periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period.  In periods when the pound strengthens, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period.

The weighted average pound/dollar exchange rate for our Unum UK line of business was 1.279, 1.336, and 1.290 for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  If the 2018 and 2017 results for our U.K. operations had been translated at the 2019 exchange rate, our adjusted operating revenue by segment would have been lower by approximately $28 million and $5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Additionally, our adjusted operating income would have been lower by approximately $5 million and $1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency.  Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds into dollars.  As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K.

We continued to report year-over-year premium growth in 2019 and 2018 in each of our principal operating business segments, driven by growth in the in-force block resulting from higher prior period sales growth, the continued expansion of our dental and vision products, the addition of our Unum Poland product, and generally stable persistency.  Premium income continues to decline, as expected, in our Closed Block segment.

Net investment income was slightly lower in 2019 relative to 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.  Net investment income in 2018 was generally consistent with 2017, with an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, offset by a decline in the yield on invested assets.


We recognized $25.3 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities in net realized investment gains and losses in 2019 compared to $17.5 million and $8.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Also included in net realized investment gains and losses were changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement, which resulted in realized gains (losses) of $8.3 million, $(15.2) million, and $30.8 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Other income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to growth in our fee-based service products in our Unum US segment, which include leave management services and administrative services only (ASO) business.

Overall benefits experience was favorable in 2019 relative to the prior periods, with a consolidated benefit ratio of 80.0 percent in 2019 compared to 89.3 percent in 2018 and 82.1 percent in 2017.  Excluding the 2018 long term care reserve increase and the 2017 unclaimed death benefits reserve increase, the benefit ratios for 2018 and 2017 were 80.9 percent and 81.6 percent, respectively.  The underlying benefits experience for each of our operating business segments is discussed more fully in "Segment Results" contained herein in this Item 7.

Commissions increased year-over-year in 2019 and 2018 driven primarily by sales growth.  The deferral of acquisition costs was lower during 2019 relative to 2018 due primarily to a shift in product mix that resulted in lower first-year commissions and a lower corresponding deferral of acquisition costs in the Unum US supplemental and voluntary product line.  The deferral of acquisition costs was higher in 2018 relative to 2017 driven primarily by overall sales growth.  Growth in the level of the deferred asset in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments resulted in higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs year-over-year in 2019 and 2018.  Also contributing to the increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was a higher level of policy terminations experienced in the Unum US voluntary benefits product line and the impact of the prospective unlocking for future experience relative to assumptions in certain of our Colonial life products.

Cost related to early retirement of debt includes costs associated with the purchase and retirement of $433.1 million aggregate liquidation/principal amount of our outstanding capital and debt securities.  Interest and debt expense increased year-over-year in 2019 and 2018 due primarily to a higher level of outstanding debt.  See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Other expenses, including compensation expense, increased in each of the years presented above due to operational investments in our business which was balanced with our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.  Included in other expenses for 2017 is a $20.6 million loss from a guaranty fund assessment related to an unaffiliated insurer that was declared insolvent.

Our effective income tax rate for 2019 was 20.4 percent, compared to 16.6 percent in 2018 and 29.2 percent in 2017.  Our 2019 and 2018 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent due to favorable tax credits, with additional favorable adjustments in 2018 related to our prior year tax return.  The TCJA was enacted in December 2017 and stipulated a reduction of the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective in 2018.  Our effective tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by the enactment of the TCJA, which reduced the net deferred tax liability and was partially offset by the Deemed Repatriation Tax.


Consolidated Sales Results

Shown below are sales results for our three principal operating business segments.

Sales shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium income on new sales which we expect to receive and report as premium income during the next 12 months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported, depending on the effective date of the new sale.  Sales do not correspond to premium income reported as revenue in accordance with GAAP.  This is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium income over a 12 month period, while premium income reported in our financial statements is reported on an "as earned" basis rather than an annualized basis and also includes renewals and persistency of in-force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales.

Sales, persistency of the existing block of business, employment and salary growth, and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium income.  Trends in new sales, as well as existing market share, also indicate the potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price levels and new product offerings.  Sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions.

See "Segment Results" as follows for a discussion of sales by segment.


Segment Results

Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate.  Financial information for each of our reporting segments is as follows.

In describing our results, we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.  We also measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items.  These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income.  See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained herein in this Item 7.

Unum US Segment

The Unum US segment is comprised of group long-term and short-term disability insurance, which includes our medical stop-loss product as well as our fee-based leave management services and ASO business, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which are comprised of individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products.


Unum US Operating Results

Shown below are financial results for the Unum US segment.  In the sections following, financial results and key ratios are also presented for the major lines of business within the segment.


Unum US Group Disability Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US group disability.


Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income increased compared to 2018, driven primarily by growth in the in-force block resulting from higher prior period sales and higher persistency in the group short-term disability product line.  Net investment income was lower relative to 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income, a decline in yield on invested assets, and a lower level of invested assets.  Other income increased relative to 2018 due to growth in our fee-based service products, which include our leave management services and ASO business.

Benefits experience was favorable compared to 2018 due primarily to favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line, partially offset by higher claims incidence in both our group long-term and short-term disability product lines.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher compared to 2018 due to sales growth.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2018 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset.  Our other expense ratio for 2019 increased compared to 2018 due primarily to an increase in operational investments in our business and growth in our fee-based service products, which was balanced with our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.

We had goodwill of $8.9 million at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income increased compared to 2017, driven primarily by growth in the in-force block due to higher prior period sales and improved persistency.  Net investment income was lower relative to 2017 due to a decrease in the level of invested assets and a decline in yield on invested assets, partially offset by higher miscellaneous investment income.

Benefits experience was favorable compared to 2017 due primarily to favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line, partially offset by higher claims incidence in certain of our group short-term disability products.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher compared to 2017 due to prior period sales growth.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2017 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset.  Our other expense ratio for 2018 increased compared to 2017 due primarily to an increase in operational investments in our business balanced with our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.


Unum US Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment.


Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income increased compared to 2018 due to growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales growth.  Net investment income was slightly higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income and a decline in yield on invested assets.

Benefits experience was unfavorable compared to 2018 due primarily to a higher average claim size in the group life product line.

Commissions were higher compared to 2018 due to prior period sales growth.  The deferral of acquisition costs was generally consistent with 2018.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2018 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset.  The other expense ratio improved compared to 2018 due to our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies balanced with operational investments in our business.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income increased compared to 2017 with growth in the in-force block due to prior period sales growth and favorable persistency.  Net investment income was lower compared to 2017 due to a decline in yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income.

Benefits experience was favorable compared to 2017 due to the previously discussed 2017 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits in our group life product line and favorable 2018 experience in our accidental death and dismemberment product line.  Excluding the 2017 reserve increase, benefits experience was generally consistent with 2017.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher compared to 2017 due to prior period sales growth.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2017 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset.  The other expense ratio improved compared to 2017 due to growth in premium income and a continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies balanced with continued investment in the growth of our business.


Unum US Supplemental and Voluntary Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US supplemental and voluntary product lines.


Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income increased compared to 2018 driven by prior period sales growth and the continued expansion of our dental and vision product line, partially offset by unfavorable persistency.  Net investment income was lower compared to 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.

Benefits experience for the individual disability product line was slightly less favorable compared to 2018 due to less favorable mortality experience, mostly offset by lower claims incidence and favorable claim recovery experience.  Benefits experience for voluntary benefits was favorable compared to 2018 due primarily to the release of active life reserves resulting from a higher level of policy terminations during 2019.  Benefits experience for the dental and vision product line was unfavorable compared to 2018 driven by higher claims utilization.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a shift in product mix that resulted in lower first-year commissions and a lower corresponding deferral of acquisition costs, partially offset by higher sales in the dental and vision product line.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in 2019 relative to 2018 due primarily to the impact of a higher level of policy terminations, particularly in the voluntary benefits product line.  Our other expense ratio improved relative to 2018 due to growth in premium income and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies balanced with operational investments in our business.

We had goodwill of $271.1 million at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income increased compared to 2017 driven by higher sales, including dental and vision where we continue to expand its distribution, partially offset by unfavorable persistency.  Net investment income was slightly lower compared to 2017 due to a decline in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets.  Other income declined relative to 2017 due to the expected decline in surrender fees as our interest sensitive life products mature.

Benefits experience for the individual disability product line compared to 2017 was less favorable due to a reserve release of $19.5 million resulting from our 2017 annual reserve adequacy update that did not recur and unfavorable 2018 claims activity, partially offset by favorable mortality experience.  Benefits experience for voluntary benefits was favorable compared to 2017 due primarily to the previously discussed 2017 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits.  Excluding this reserve increase, benefits experience was favorable across most of our voluntary product lines.  Benefits experience for the dental and vision product line was favorable compared to 2017 and was within our expectations.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher compared to 2017 due primarily to sales growth.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased year over year due to growth in the level of the deferred asset.  Our other expense ratio improved relative to 2017 due to growth in premium income and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies balanced with an increase in operational investments in our business.


Sales

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Group sales declined slightly compared to 2018 due to lower new customer sales in both the core market, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 employees, and the large case market, partially offset by higher sales to existing customers in both the core and large case markets and growth in our medical stop-loss product.  The sales mix in the group market sector for 2019 was approximately 56 percent core market and 44 percent large case market.

Individual disability sales, which are primarily concentrated in the multi-life market, decreased compared to 2018 due to lower sales to new customers.  Voluntary benefits sales decreased slightly compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower sales to new customers in the core market, partially offset by higher sales to new customers in the large case market.  Dental and vision sales increased compared to 2018 driven by higher sales to both new and existing customers.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Group sales decreased compared to 2017 due to lower sales to new and existing customers in both the core and large case market segments.  The sales mix in the group market sector for 2018 was approximately 59 percent core market and 41 percent large case market.

Individual disability sales increased compared to 2017 due to higher sales to both new and existing customers.  Voluntary benefits sales increased compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher sales to existing customers in both the core and large case markets, partially offset by lower sales to new customers in the large case market.  Dental and vision sales increased compared to 2017 driven by higher sales to both new and existing customers resulting from continued expansion.


Segment Outlook

We remain committed to offering consumers a broad set of financial protection benefit products at the worksite.  During 2020, we will continue to invest in a unique customer experience defined by simplicity, empathy, and deep industry expertise through the re-design of our processes and the increased utilization of digital capabilities and technology to enhance enrollment, underwriting, and claims processing.  In addition, we will continue to focus on the expansion of our portfolio of products.  In particular, we believe our significant investment in leave management services will allow for substantial growth opportunities, particularly with larger employers, and stronger persistency in our core products.  With respect to smaller employers, we will continue to enhance our distribution model and provide comprehensive consumer-focused products.  We believe our active client management and differentiated integrated customer experience across our product lines, underpinned by strong risk management, will continue to enable us to grow our market.

We anticipate stable adjusted operating income growth and continued underlying profitability in 2020, with disciplined sales and premium growth, consistent risk management, and a continued focus on operational efficiency.  The low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields as well as discount rates on our insurance liabilities.  Our net investment income may continue to be unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in miscellaneous investment income.  As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving methodology, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate.  We expect that our underwriting results in 2020 will continue at a level generally consistent with 2019.  We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly.


Unum International Segment

The Unum International segment is comprised of our operations in both the United Kingdom and Poland.  Our Unum UK products include insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business, which includes dental, individual disability, and critical illness products.  Our Unum Poland products include insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders.  Unum International's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants.

Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Unum International segment.  Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of Unum UK and Unum Poland are the British pound sterling and Polish zloty, respectively.  Premium income, net investment income, claims, and expenses are received or paid in the functional currency, and we hold functional currency-denominated assets to support functional currency-denominated policy reserves and liabilities.  We translate functional currency-denominated financial statement items into dollars for our consolidated financial reporting.  We translate income statement items using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate balance sheet items using the exchange rate at the end of the period.  We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets.

Fluctuations in exchange rates have an effect on Unum International's reported financial results and our consolidated financial results. In periods when the functional currency strengthens relative to the preceding period, translation increases current period


results relative to the prior period.  In periods when the functional currency weakens, translation decreases current period results relative to the prior period.

Goodwill

We had total goodwill of $44.0 million for the Unum International segment at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.

Unum UK Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Unum UK product lines in functional currency.


Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income was higher compared to 2018 due to higher overall persistency, sales growth, and the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line.

Net investment income was higher compared to 2018 due to higher miscellaneous investment income resulting from a higher than normal level of bond calls, and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by a lower yield on fixed-rate bonds and lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds, which we invest in to support the claim reserves associated with certain of our group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in benefits. The decrease in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds was offset by a decrease in the reserves for future claim payments related to the inflation index-linked group long-term disability and group life policies.

Benefits experience was unfavorable relative to 2018 due to unfavorable mortality experience and a reduction in the claim reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher than normal level of bond calls  experienced during 2019, partially offset by lower inflation-linked increases in benefits related to our group products.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher relative to 2018 due to higher sales.  The amortization of acquisition costs was lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a decline in the level of the deferred asset.  The other expense ratio was lower relative to 2018 due to higher premiums and our continued focus on expense management.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income increased compared to 2017 due primarily to growth in the in-force block driven by higher persistency and rate increases in our group long-term disability product line.

Net investment income decreased compared to 2017 due primarily to a lower yield on our fixed-rate bonds, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets and higher investment income from inflation index-linked bonds.  The increase in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds was offset by an increase in the reserves for future claim payments related to inflation index-linked group long-term disability and group life policies.

Benefits experience was consistent with 2017 as favorable claims recoveries in our group long-term disability product line were offset by unfavorable claims activity in our group life and supplemental product lines and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs decreased relative to 2017 due to lower sales.  The amortization of acquisition costs was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a decline in the deferred asset.  The other expense ratio was lower relative to 2017 due to higher premiums and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.


Sales

Certain prior year amounts below were reclassified to conform to current year presentation.


The following discussion of sales results relates only to our Unum UK product lines and is based on functional currency.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Group long-term disability sales were generally consistent with 2018, with higher sales to new customers in the core market, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 500 employees, mostly offset by a decline in sales to both new and existing customers in our large case market.

Group life sales were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in sales to new and existing customers in both our core and large case markets.

Supplemental sales were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher sales in the group critical illness product line.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Group long-term disability sales decreased compared to 2017 due to lower sales to new customers in the large case market, partially offset by higher sales to both new and existing customers in our core market and higher sales to existing customers in our large case market.

Group life sales decreased compared to 2017 due to lower sales to new and existing customers in our large case market, partially offset by an increase in sales to new and existing customers in our core market.

Supplemental sales increased compared to 2017 due primarily to an increase in the group critical illness product line, partially offset by a decline in dental product sales.

Segment Outlook

We are committed to driving growth in the Unum International segment and will build on the capabilities that we believe will generate growth and profitability in our businesses.  Within our Unum UK line of business, expanding our group long-term disability market position remains a priority.  In addition, we will continue to focus on increasing participation levels in the large case segment while also developing new distribution and services to reach new small case clients.

We will also continue the implementation of price increases and will maintain our disciplined sales approach.  Within our Unum Poland line of business, we will leverage our U.S. and U.K. expertise to grow existing distribution channels and expand our current product offerings.  We continue to invest in digital capabilities, technology, and product enhancements which we believe will drive sustainable growth.

Negotiations following the recent withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU will continue to generate uncertainty in the U.K. economy.  This uncertainty may continue to pressure our growth expectations in the near-term and may also lead to a higher rate of claim incidence, lower levels of claim recoveries, or lower claim discount rates, however, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities as these negotiations are resolved and the operating environment improves.  As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving strategy, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate.  We will likely continue to experience volatility in net investment income and our benefit ratio due to fluctuations in the level of inflation in the U.K., however, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on adjusted operating income.  There are no indications currently that capital requirements for our U.K. operations will change due to the recent withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, but economic conditions may in the near term cause volatility in our solvency ratios.  We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly to respond to external challenges.


Colonial Life Segment

The Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers.

Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Colonial Life segment.


Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income increased compared to 2018 as a result of growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales growth, which includes the expansion of our dental and vision products, offset partially by lower persistency.  Net investment income decreased relative to the prior year due to a lower yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.

Benefits experience was generally consistent with 2018, with favorable experience in the life line of business mostly offset by unfavorable experience in the accident, sickness, and disability and cancer and critical illness product lines.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were generally consistent with 2018 due to stable sales results relative to the prior year.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased compared to the prior year due primarily to overall growth in the level of the deferred asset and the impact of the prospective unlocking for future experience relative to assumptions for our interest-sensitive voluntary life products.  The other expense ratio improved relative to 2018 due to an increase in premium income and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.

We had goodwill of $27.7 million at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income increased compared to 2017 as a result of sales growth.  Net investment income increased relative to 2017 due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets.

Benefits experience was favorable compared to 2017 due to the previously discussed 2017 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits.  Excluding this reserve increase, benefits experience was consistent with 2017.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher relative to 2017 due to sales growth.  The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased compared to 2017 due primarily to growth in the level of the deferred asset.  The other expense ratio was higher relative to 2017 due to costs related to our territory expansion initiatives, investments in our business, and the roll-out of our dental and vision products.


Sales

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Commercial market sales decreased primarily due to lower new customer account sales in both the core market, which we define as accounts with fewer than 1,000 employees, and the large case market, partially offset by higher existing customer account sales in the core market and the continued expansion of our dental and vision products.  The increase in our public sector market for 2019 was driven by an increase in both new and existing customer account sales.  The number of new accounts and average new case size decreased 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Sales were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to growth in both new and existing customer account sales and the expansion of our dental and vision products.  Commercial market sales increased primarily due to higher new and existing customer account sales in the core market and higher existing sales in the large case market.  The slight increase in our public sector market for 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in existing customer account sales, partially offset by a decrease in new account sales.  The number of new accounts increased 9.8 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, while the average new case size decreased 4.0 percent.

Segment Outlook

We remain committed to providing employees and their families with simple, modern, and personal benefit solutions.  During 2020, we will continue to focus on expanding our distribution system through the growth and development of our agency sales force and establishing effective broker partnerships.  We will also continue to invest in new solutions and digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience for our business partners and further improve productivity.  We will continue to focus on accelerating growth in our business through territory growth, persistency investments, and increased participation rates.  We believe our distribution system, customer service capabilities, the continued expansion of our new dental products, and ability to serve all market sizes position us well for future growth.

We expect stable adjusted operating income growth in 2020, with sales and premium growth, consistent benefits experience, and a continued focus on operational efficiency balanced with our continued investments in future growth.  The lower interest rate environment will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins, and volatility in miscellaneous investment income is likely to continue.  While we believe our underlying profitability will remain strong, current economic conditions and increasing competition in the voluntary workplace market are seen as external risks to achievement of our business plans.  We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly.


Closed Block Segment

The Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care, individual disability, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed.  We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012.  Individual disability in this segment generally consists of policies we sold prior to the mid-1990s and entirely discontinued selling in 2004.  Other insurance products include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines.

Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Closed Block segment.


Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income for long-term care was generally consistent with the prior year, with rate increases offsetting policy terminations.  We continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group long-term care policies which reflect assumptions as of the date of filings.  In states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved, we routinely provide customers options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs.  Premium income for individual disability decreased compared to 2018 due to policy terminations and maturities.

Net investment income was higher relative to 2018 primarily due to an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by lower miscellaneous investment income.  Other income, which includes the underlying results and associated net investment income of certain blocks of individual disability reinsured business, continues to decline due to expected terminations and maturities.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care, excluding the previously discussed reserve increase, was not comparable to 2018 due to the update in our assumptions during the third quarter of 2018, but was generally consistent with our expectations during 2019.  Individual disability benefits experience was favorable relative to 2018 driven by overall favorable claims activity.

The other expense ratio was higher than 2018 due to the expected decline in premium income for individual disability, partially offset by our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income for long-term care was generally consistent with the prior year, with rate increases offsetting policy terminations.  Premium income for individual disability decreased compared to 2017 due to policy terminations and maturities.

Net investment income was higher relative to 2017 primarily due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets.  Other income declined due to expected terminations and maturities.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care, excluding the previously discussed reserve increase, was not comparable to 2017 due to the update in our assumptions during the third quarter of 2018, but was generally consistent with our expectations in the second half of 2018, with an interest adjusted loss ratio of 85.4 percent.  Individual disability benefits experience was favorable relative to 2017 due primarily to lower claims incidence and a lower average size of new claims.

The other expense ratio was slightly higher than 2017 due to the expected decline in premium income for individual disability, partially offset by our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.


Segment Outlook

During 2020, we will continue to execute on our well-defined strategy of implementing long-term care premium rate increases, efficient capital management, improved financial analysis, and operational effectiveness.  We will continue to explore structural options to enhance financial flexibility.  Despite continued anticipated premium rate increases in our long-term care business, we expect overall premium income and adjusted operating revenue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down.  We will likely experience volatility in net investment income due to fluctuations of miscellaneous investment income and the increased allocation towards alternative assets in the long-term care product line portfolio.  We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly.

Profitability of our long-tailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity, resolutions, investment returns, premium rate increases, and persistency.  We believe that the interest adjusted loss ratios for long-term care and the individual disability lines of business will be relatively flat over the long term, but these product lines may continue to experience quarterly volatility, particularly in the near term for our long-term care product lines as our claim block matures and as we continue the implementation of premium rate increases.  Specific to our long-term care line of business, which is in loss recognition and should report levels of benefits plus operating expenses that equal the gross premium reported, we expect the long term interest adjusted loss ratio to be in the 85 to 90 percent range with some quarterly volatility.  Claim resolution rates, which measure the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile.  Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period.  It is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions, including, but not limited to, interest rates, mortality, morbidity, resolutions, premium rate increases, benefit change elections, and persistency, could result in a material impact on the adequacy of our reserves, including adjustments to reserves established under loss recognition.


Corporate Segment

The Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expenses not allocated to a line of business.

Operating Results

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Net investment income was lower in 2018 due primarily to both a lower yield and a lower level of invested assets.

Interest, debt, and other expenses were higher in 2019 relative to 2018, driven primarily by costs related to the early retirement of debt, higher pension costs, and a higher level of outstanding debt, partially offset by acquisition and restructuring costs in 2018 that did not recur.  See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt” contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Net investment income was higher relative to 2017 due primarily to an increase in the level of invested assets and a higher yield.

Interest and other expenses were higher relative to 2017 due primarily to a higher level of outstanding debt, a higher overall rate of interest, increased acquisition-related expenses, and certain restructuring costs.  Interest and other expenses for 2017 includes a $20.6 million loss incurred in 2017 from a guaranty fund assessment related to an unaffiliated insurer that was declared insolvent.  See Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion on the loss from a guaranty fund assessment.

Segment Outlook

We expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through the statutory earnings in our insurance subsidiaries and believe we are well positioned with flexibility to preserve our capital strength while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders.


Investments

Overview

Our investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector.  We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur.  We believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio, including credit and interest rate management, has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our results.

We have a formal investment policy that includes overall quality and diversification objectives and establishes limits by asset class, investment rating, and single issuer.  The majority of our investments are in investment-grade publicly traded securities.  This ensures the desired liquidity and preserves the capital value of our portfolios, although due to the long-term nature of our insurance liabilities we are also able to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns within the limits of our investment policy.  Our asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us, reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors, and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries.  We review our policies and guidelines annually, or more frequently if deemed necessary, and recommend adjustments as appropriate.

See "Critical Accounting Estimates" contained herein in this Item 7 for further discussion of our valuation of investments.

Fixed Maturity Securities

The fair values and associated unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity securities portfolio, by industry classification, are as follows:

Fixed Maturity Securities - By Industry Classification

As of December 31, 2019


The following two tables show the length of time our investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities had been in a gross unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2019 and at the end of the prior four quarters.  The relationships of the current fair value to amortized cost are not necessarily indicative of the fair value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of the relationships after December 31, 2019.  The decrease in the unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities during 2019 was due to a decrease in both U.S. Treasury rates and credit spreads.

Unrealized Loss on Investment-Grade Fixed Maturity Securities

Length of Time in Unrealized Loss Position


Unrealized Loss on Below-Investment-Grade Fixed Maturity Securities

Length of Time in Unrealized Loss Position

At December 31, 2019, we held two below-investment grade fixed maturity securities with a gross unrealized loss greater than $10.0 million.  One security is related to a global pharmaceutical company and had a fair value of $65.3 million and a gross unrealized loss of $11.7 million.  The other security is related to a global business process automation company and had a fair value of $8.1 million and a gross unrealized loss of $11.9 million. We intend to and have the ability to continue to hold these securities to recovery of amortized cost and believe that the declines in fair value are temporary.

During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $20.8 million on fixed maturity securities issued by a specialty pharmaceutical company.  The company has a high level of debt, has experienced some operational issues, and is facing fines and potentially a large litigation expense, which led to our decision to no longer hold these securities to recovery of amortized cost.  At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of more than three years.

During the second quarter of 2019, we recognized a realized loss of $15.6 million on the sale of securities of a U.S. based oil and natural gas producer.  The company has been impacted by the significant decline in energy prices, a high level of debt, and an inability to complete certain asset sales.  At the time of disposition, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years.

We had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from other-than-temporary impairments during 2018 or 2017 and no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during 2018 or 2017.


At December 31, 2019, our mortgage/asset-backed securities had an average life of 6.30 years, effective duration of 4.13 years, and a weighted average credit rating of AAA.  The mortgage/asset-backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services.  One of the risks involved in investing in mortgage/asset-backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment.  We use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates.  The timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income.  We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities.  Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected.  The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income.

As of December 31, 2019, the amortized cost and fair value of our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities was $3,071.4 million and $3,188.5 million, respectively.  Below-investment-grade securities are inherently riskier than investment-grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher.  Also, the secondary market for certain below-investment-grade issues can be highly illiquid.  Additional downgrades may occur, but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below-investment-grade securities, nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity.

Fixed Maturity Securities - Foreign Exposure

Our investments in issuers in foreign countries are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes, including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize non-market risks.  In our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities, specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses.  For each security, we consider the political, legal, and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates.  The country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuer's headquarters, in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived.  We do not have exposure to foreign currency risk, as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities.  We continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure.

Mortgage Loans

Our mortgage loan po

rtfolio was $2,397.0 million and $2,295.0 million on an amortized cost basis at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans.  Our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types.  The incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low.  Due to conservative underwriting, we expect the level of problem loans to remain low.  We held no impaired mortgage loans at December 31, 2019.  We held one impaired mortgage loan at December 31, 2018 with a net realizable value of $3.4 million, net of a valuation allowance of $0.2 million.  During the first quarter of 2019, the impaired mortgage loan was settled, and we recognized an additional loss of $0.1 million.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment, duration, foreign currency, and credit risks.  Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury rates, current and forward currency swaps, forward treasury locks, currency forward contracts, forward contracts on specific fixed income securities, and credit default swaps.  Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held.  At December 31, 2019, we had no credit exposure on derivatives.  We held $24.0 million of cash collateral from our counterparties at December 31, 2019.  The carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was $28.6 million at December 31, 2019.  We had no cash collateral posted to our counterparties at December 31, 2019.  We believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties, all of which have an investment-grade credit rating, and by our use of cross-collateralization agreements.


Other

Our exposure to non-current investments, defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and/or principal payments, totaled $30.5 million and $36.0 million on a fair value basis at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instruments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in our insurance subsidiaries.  Premium and investment income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash.  Debt and/or securities offerings provide additional sources of liquidity.  Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, and taxes, as well as purchases of new investments.

We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations.  We attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business.  However, deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities, which may negatively impact our cash flows.  Furthermore, if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries, this will negatively impact statutory capital, which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries' capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies.  A reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations.

Our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities.  A decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations.  However, our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is generally consistent, even during cycles of economic downturns, which serves to minimize liquidity risk.

The liquidity requirements of the holding company Unum Group include common stock dividends, interest and debt service, acquisitions, and ongoing investments in our businesses.  Unum Group's liquidity requirements are met by assets held by Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies, dividends from primarily our insurance subsidiaries, and issuance of common stock, debt, or other capital securities and borrowings from existing credit facilities, as needed.  As of December 31, 2019, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies held fixed maturity securities, short-term investments, and cash of $863 million.  Fixed maturity securities consisted primarily of mortgage/asset-backed securities with an average maturity of 4.4 years.  Short-term investments consisted primarily of commercial paper.  No significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access funds in any of our U.S. or foreign intermediate holding companies.  Dividends repatriated from our foreign subsidiaries are eligible for 100 percent exemption from U.S. income tax but may be subject to withholding tax and/or tax on foreign currency gain or loss.

As part of our capital deployment strategy, we repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock, as authorized by our board of directors.  Our current share repurchase program was approved by our board of directors in May 2019 and authorizes the repurchase of up to $750 million of common stock through November 2020, with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price.  This new authorization replaced the previous authorization of $750 million that was scheduled to expire in November 2019.

During 2019, we repurchased 12.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $400 million.  The dollar value of shares remaining under the current repurchase program was approximately $516 million at December 31, 2019.  See Note 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Cash Available from Subsidiaries

Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders, to pay debt obligations, and/or to pay expenses.  These payments by our insurance and non-insurance


subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, operating and investment management fees, and/or interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary.

Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities.  For life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S., that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer's statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year.  The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds.

Certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re) and Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States with Unum Group as the ultimate parent.  The ability of Northwind Re and Fairwind to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Northwind Re and Fairwind.

The ability of Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as RBC ratios and capital adequacy and/or solvency requirements, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings. The RBC ratios for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 are in line with our expectations and are significantly above the level that would require state regulatory action.

Unum Group and/or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries, the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the U.K. Unum Limited is subject to the requirements of Solvency II, an EU directive, which prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry.  Our European holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies, while its subsidiaries (the Unum European Economic Area (EEA) Group), which includes Unum Limited, are subject to group supervision under Solvency II. The Unum EEA Group received approval from the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the Solvency II capital regime continues to be implemented.  There are currently no indications that capital requirements for the Unum EEA Group will change as a result of the U.K.'s exit from the EU, but economic conditions may in the near term cause volatility in our solvency ratios.

The payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary's board of directors.

The amount available during 2019 for the payment of ordinary dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers, was approximately $995 million, of which $956.1 million was declared and paid.  The amount available during 2019 from Unum Limited was approximately £140 million, of which £25.0 million was declared and paid to one of our U.K. holding companies.  During 2019, Northwind Re paid dividends of $52.8 million to Northwind Holdings.  Fairwind paid no dividends during 2019.

During 2020, we intend to maintain a level of capital in our insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins.  Although we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends, based on applicable restrictions under current law, approximately $1,035 million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2020 for the payment of dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers.  Approximately £180 million is available for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2020, subject to regulatory approval.

Insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non-insurance subsidiaries except where the non-insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by Unum Group.


Funding for Employee Benefit Plans

We made contributions of $68.2 million and £3.4 million to our U.S. and U.K. defined contribution plans, respectively, in 2019 and expect to make contributions of approximately $75 million and £4 million during 2020.  We made a de minimis amount of contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and no contribution to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan during 2019.  We do not expect to make any contributions to either plan during 2020.  We have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  We have estimated our future funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and under applicable U.K. law and do not believe that any future funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity.  See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our employee benefit plans.

Debt

There are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations.  We continually monitor our debt covenants to ensure we remain in compliance.  We have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants.

Maturities, Purchases, and Retirement of Debt

Northwind Holdings made principal payments on its floating rate, senior secured non-recourse notes of $60.0 million in each of 2019, 2018, and 2017.

During 2019 we purchased and retired (i) $22.8 million aggregate liquidation amount of our 7.405% capital securities due 2038; (ii) $30.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.190% medium-term notes due 2028; (iii) $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.250% senior notes due 2028; and (iv) $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.000% senior notes due 2021.

In 2018, our $200.0 million 7.00% senior unsecured notes matured.

In 2017, we purchased and retired the remaining $3.4 million of principal on our senior secured floating rate notes acquired through our purchase of Starmount.

Issuance of Debt

In September 2019, we issued $450.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2049.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

In June 2019, we issued $400.0 million of 4.000% senior notes due 2029.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

In 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.25% junior subordinated notes due 2058.  The notes are redeemable at or above par on or after June 15, 2023 and rank equally in the right of payment with our other junior subordinated debt securities.

Credit Facilities

In April 2019, we amended the terms of our existing five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing it from $400.0 million to $500.0 million.  The credit facility, which was previously set to expire in 2021, was extended through April 2024.  Under the terms of the amended agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $700.0 million, up from the previous amount of $600.0 million.  We also may request, on up to two occasions, that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year.  The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations.  At December 31, 2019, letters of credit totaling $0.6 million had been issued from the credit facility, but there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.

Also in April 2019, we separately entered into a three-year, $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a different syndicate of lenders, which is set to expire in April 2022.  Under the terms of the agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $140.0 million.  We also may request that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year.  The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations.  At


December 31, 2019, there have been no letters of credit issued from the credit facility and there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.

Borrowings under the credit facilities are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary.  The two primary financial covenants include limitations based on our leverage ratio and consolidated net worth.  We are also subject to covenants that limit subsidiary indebtedness.  The credit facilities provide for borrowings at an interest rate based either on the prime rate or LIBOR.

Shelf Registration

We filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2017 to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase contracts, units and warrants.  The shelf registration enables us to raise funds from the offering of any securities covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof, subject to market conditions and our capital needs.

See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our debt.

Commitments

The following table summarizes contractual obligations and our reinsurance recoverable by period as of December 31, 2019:

Short-term and long-term debt includes contractual principal and interest payments and therefore exceeds the amount shown in the consolidated balance sheets.

Policyholder liability maturities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in-force policyholder liabilities and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties


as to the timing and amount of claim payments.  We utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in-force business.  The primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity, claim resolution rates, persistency rates, and interest rates.  These cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments.  The timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly from the projections above.

Pensions and OPEB commitments relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for our employees, including our non-qualified pension plan.  Pension plan obligations, other than the non-qualified plan, represent our contributions to the pension plans and are projected based on the expected future minimum contributions as required under current U.S. and U.K. legislative funding requirements.  Non-qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit obligations represent the expected benefit payments related to these plans which we expect to pay, as incurred, from our general assets.

Miscellaneous liabilities include commissions due and accrued, deferred compensation liabilities, contingent considerations, state premium taxes payable, amounts due to reinsurance companies, legally binding commitments to fund investments, obligations to return unrestricted cash collateral to our securities lending and derivative counterparties, and various other liabilities that represent contractual obligations.  Obligations where the timing of the payment is uncertain are included in the one year or less category.

See "Critical Accounting Estimates" contained herein in this Item 7 and Notes 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 15 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our various commitments and obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Purchase obligations include commitments of $629.8 million to fund certain of our investments.  These are included in the preceding table based on the expiration date of the commitments.  The funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from appropriate external parties and may or may not be funded.  Also included are obligations with outside parties for computer data processing services, software maintenance agreements, and consulting services.  The aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was $54.2 million at December 31, 2019.

As part of our regular investing strategy, we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and short-term agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date.  For both types of transactions, we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral.  Generally, cash is received as collateral under these agreements.  In the event that securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them.  We also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and short-term agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date.  See "Transfers of Financial Assets" as follows for further discussion.

To help limit the credit exposure of derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset a

gainst contracts in a loss position.  We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives.  These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount.  Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held.  At December 31, 2019, we had no credit exposure on derivatives.  We held cash collateral from our counterparties of $24.0 million at December 31, 2019 and had posted fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of $28.6 million as collateral to our counterparties.

See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information.

Transfers of Financial Assets

Our investment policy permits us to lend f

ixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements, which increases our investment income with minimal risk.  We account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as secured borrowings.  As of December 31, 2019, we did not hold cash collateral from securities lending agreements.  The average balance for securities lending agreements which were collateralized by cash during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.9 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $5.9 million.  In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had $186.5 million of off-balance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control.  The average balance of these off-balance sheet


transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $189.5 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $274.5 million.

To manage our cash position more efficiently, we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions.  We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments.  We had no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019, nor did we utilize any repurchase agreements during 2019.  Our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position, the availability of long-term investments that meet our purchasing criteria, and our general business needs.

Certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of regional Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB).  As of December 31, 2019, we owned $18.5 million of FHLB common stock and had no outstanding advances from the regional FHLBs.

See Note 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information.

Consolidated Cash Flows

Operating Cash Flows

Operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income, offset by payments of claims, commissions, expenses, and income taxes.  Premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales, but on policy renewals and growth of existing business, renewal price increases, and persistency.  Investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and capital and on the earned yield.  The level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business.  The level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy, as previously discussed in the operating results by segment.

The variance in the change in insurance reserves and liabilities to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2018 was due primarily to the 2018 reserve increase for our long-term care line of business.

Investing Cash Flows

Investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments.  Investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments.  Our investment strategy is to match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business.  When market opportunities arise, we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio.  We may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and/or re-balance our portfolio.  As a result, sales before maturity may vary from period to period.  The sale and purchase of short-term investments is influenced by proceeds received from issuance of debt, our securities lending program, and by the amount of cash which is at times held in short-term investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate long-term investments, repay maturing debt, and/or to fund our capital deployment program.  Our cash flows for  2018 include cash outflows, net of cash acquired, of $145.4 million related to all of our acquisitions during the year.

See Notes 3 and 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further information.


Financing Cash Flows

Financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt, repurchase of common stock, and dividends paid to stockholders.

During 2019, we purchased and retired $433.1 million aggregate liquidation/principal amount of our outstanding capital and debt securities, including debt repurchase costs of $25.9 million for a total cash outflow of $459.0 million.  During 2018, our $200.0 million 7.00% senior unsecured notes matured.  During 2017, we purchased and retired the remaining $3.4 million of principal on our senior secured floating rate notes acquired through our purchase of Starmount.  During each of the years 2019, 2018, and 2017 we made principal payments of $60.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse notes issued by Northwind Holdings.

During 2019, we issued $450.0 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2049 and $400.0 million of 4.00% senior notes due 2029 and received total proceeds of $841.9 million.  During 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.25% junior subordinated notes due 2058 and received total proceeds of $290.7 million.

Cash used to repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock during 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $400.3 million, $356.2 million, and $401.8 million, respectively.  During 2019, 2018, and 2017 we paid dividends of $229.2 million, $215.6 million, and $196.0 million, respectively, to holders of Unum Group's common stock.

See "Debt" contained herein in this Item 7, and Notes 8 and 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further information.

Ratings

AM Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries.  We compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies.  A downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, particularly large case group sales and individual sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete.  A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital.

The table below reflects the outlook as well as the issuer credit ratings for Unum Group and the financial strength ratings for each of our traditional insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

NR = not rated

We maintain an ongoing dialogue with the four rating agencies that evaluate us in order to inform them of progress we are making regarding our strategic objectives and financial plans as well as other pertinent issues.  A significant component of our


communications involves our annual review meeting with each of the four agencies.  We hold other meetings throughout the year regarding our business, including, but not limited to, quarterly updates.

AM Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P affirmed their ratings for our domestic insurance subsidiaries and issuer credit ratings for Unum Group during 2019.  There have been no other changes in any of the rating agencies' outlooks or ratings during 2019 or in 2020 prior to the date of this filing.

Agency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities.  Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment, not conditional on any other rating.  Given the dynamic nature of the ratings process, changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near-term.  Based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our insurance risk profile, our financial flexibility, our operating performance, and the quality of our investment portfolio, we do not expect any negative actions from any of the four rating agencies related to either Unum Group's current issuer credit ratings or the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.  However, in the event that we are unable to meet the rating agency specific guideline values to maintain our current ratings, including but not limited to maintenance of our capital management metrics at the threshold values stated and maintenance of our financial flexibility and operational consistency, we could be placed on a negative credit watch, with a potential for a downgrade to both our issuer credit ratings and our financial strength ratings.

See "Ratings" contained herein in Item 1 and "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A for further discussion.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to various market risk exposures, including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.  The following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties.  Estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur (sensitivity analysis).  Caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below, as actual results may differ.  See "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A, "Investments" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 2, 3, and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of the qualitative aspects of market risk, including derivative financial instrument activity.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments, derivatives, and interest sensitive liabilities.  Fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, policy loans, and short-term investments.  Fixed maturity securities include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, public utility bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and redeemable preferred stock, all of which are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations.  Certain of our financial instruments, fixed maturity securities and derivatives, are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.  The fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.  A rise in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized gain related to these financial instruments, but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities.  Conversely, a decline in interest rates may increase the net unrealized gain, but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return.  Although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments, terminate derivative positions, determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired, or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge.

Other fixed rate investments, such as mortgage loans and policy loans, are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances, respectively, rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.  These investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets.  A change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value.  A change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans, as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans.  Carrying amounts for short-term investments approximate fair value, and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investments.

We believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal, primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries, the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies, and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business.  We


may in certain circumstances, however, need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements, changes in tax laws, rating agency decisions, and/or unexpected changes in liquidity needs.

Although our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we therefore have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk, which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts.  Changes in interest rates and individuals' behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows.  We actively monitor our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to manage interest rate risk.  Due to the long duration of our long-term care product, the timing of our investment cash flows do not match those of our maturing liabilities.  We model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields.  Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes.  We use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments.  We use current and forward interest rate swaps, options on forward interest rate swaps, and forward treasury locks to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities.

Debt is not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.  If we modify or replace existing debt instruments at current market rates, we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction.  We believe our debt-related risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal.  In the near term, we expect that our need for external financing is small, but changes in our business could increase our need.

We measure our financial instruments' market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis.  This analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 based on a hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels.  The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.

The hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown as follows:


(1)

These financial instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets.  The corresponding offsetting change is reported in other comprehensive income or loss, net of income tax, except for changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges or derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the offset of which is reported as a component of net realized investment gain or loss.

(2)

The adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments to policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs that would be necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the fixed maturity securities had been realized.  Changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss, net of income tax.

The effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates.  The effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage-backed securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage-backed securities.  These hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value.  The changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flow analyses.  Because we actively manage our investments and liabilities, actual changes could be less than those estimated above.

We remain in an environment of low interest rates, which continues to place pressure on our profit margins as we invest cash flows to support our businesses.  We estimate that we will have approximately $1.9 billion of investable cash flows in 2020.  Assuming interest rates and credit spreads remain constant throughout 2021 at the January 2020 market levels, our net investment income would decrease by an immaterial amount in both 2020 and 2021 as a result of the investment of cash flows at levels below our current expectations.  This interest rate scenario does not give consideration to the effect of other factors which could impact these results, such as changes in the bond market and changes in hedging strategies and positions, nor does it consider the potential change to our discount rate reserve assumptions and any mitigating factors such as pricing adjustments.  In addition, a continued low or declining interest rate environment may also result in an increase in the net periodic benefit costs for our pension plans, but we do not believe it would materially affect net income in 2020 or 2021.


Foreign Currency Risk

The functional currency of our U.K. operations is the British pound sterling.  The functional currency of our operations in Poland is the Polish zloty.  We are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the British pound sterling and Polish zloty to U.S. dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our U.K. and Polish operations.  Fluctuations in exchange rates have an effect on our reported financial results.  We do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk.  Because we do not actually convert our functional currency into dollars except for a limited number of transactions, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in our U.K. or Polish operations.

Assuming the pound to dollar exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the December 31, 2019 and 2018 levels, stockholders' equity as reported in U.S. dollars would have been lower by approximately $68 million and $62 million, respectively.  Assuming the pound to dollar average exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the actual average exchange rates for 2019 and 2018, adjusted operating income, as reported in U.S. dollars, would have decreased approximately $10 million and $11 million, respectively.  Our Polish operations are currently not a significant portion of our overall operations and any changes in the dollar exchange rate would not represent a material impact to our reported financial results in U.S. dollars.

Dividends paid by Unum Limited are generally held at our U.K. finance subsidiary or our U.K. holding company.  If these funds are repatriated to our U.S. holding company, we would at that time be subject to foreign currency risk as the value of the dividend, when converted into U.S. dollars, would be dependent upon the foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion.

We are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to certain foreign investment securities denominated in local currencies.  We use foreign currency interest rate swaps to hedge or minimize the foreign exchange risk associated with these instruments.

See "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A and "Consolidated Operating Results" and "Unum International Segment" contained herein in Item 7 for further information concerning foreign currency translation.

Risk Management

Effectively taking and managing risks is essential to the success of our Company.  To facilitate this effort, we have a formal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, with a framework comprising the following key components:

•

Risk-aware culture and governance

•

Risk appetite policy

•

Risk identification and prioritization

•

Risk and capital modeling

•

Risk management activities

•

Risk reporting

Our ERM framework is the ongoing system of people, processes, and tools across our Company under which we intend to function consistently and collectively to identify and assess risks and opportunities, to manage all material risks within our risk appetite, and to contribute to strategic decision making.  With the goal of maximizing shareholder value, the primary objectives of our ERM framework are to support Unum Group in meeting its operational and financial objectives, maintaining liquidity, optimizing capital, and protecting franchise value.

Risk-Aware Culture and Governance

We employ a risk management model under which risk-based decisions are made daily on a local level.  To achieve long-term success, we believe risk management must be the responsibility of all employees.  The individual and collective decisions of our employees play a key role in successfully managing our overall risk profile.  We strive for a culture of integrity, commitment, and accountability and we believe these values allow our employees to feel comfortable identifying issues as well as taking ownership for addressing potential problems.

Our employees have an obligation to report issues that they believe will have a material financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company.  We offer several channels for employees to report their issues or concerns and encourage employees to use the channel that is most appropriate for their situation.  We recommend that an employee initially discuss their concerns with their manager; however, if that channel is not appropriate an employee may use any of the other reporting channels available.


By employing various approaches, we have established a culture that supports candid discussion and reporting of risks while empowering our employees to take ownership for risk management.

Our culture is reinforced by our system of risk governance.  We employ a multi-layered risk control system.  Our three lines of defense model is depicted below.

Business units are primarily responsible for managing their principal risks.  Our risk committees and other management committees serve risk and control functions responsible for providing risk oversight, or the second line of risk control.  Our internal audit team provides periodic independent reviews and assurance activities serving as our third line of risk control.

In addition, our board has an active role, as a whole and through its committees, in overseeing management of our risks.  The board is responsible for the oversight of strategic risk and regularly reviews information regarding our capital, liquidity, and operations, as well as the risks associated with each.  The risk and finance committee of the board is responsible for oversight of our risk management process, including financial risk, operational risk, and any other risk not specifically assigned to another board committee.  It also is responsible for oversight of risks associated with investments, capital and financing plans and activities, and related financial matters, including matters pertaining to our Closed Block segment.  The audit committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks relating to financial reporting risk and certain operational risks.  Cyber-related operational risk is the joint responsibility of the risk and finance committee and the audit committee.  The human capital committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks relating to our compensation plans and programs.  The regulatory compliance committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks related to regulatory, compliance, policy, and legal matters, both current and emerging, and whether of a local, state, federal, or international nature.  While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks in addition to the risk information it receives directly.

Our executive risk management committee is responsible for overseeing our enterprise-wide risk management program.  The chief risk officer, who is a member of the executive risk management committee, has primary responsibility for our ERM program and is supported by corporate risk committees and by the risk committees of our operating segments.

Operating segment risk committees for Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, and Closed Block are responsible for oversight of risks specific to their businesses.  These committees are responsible for identifying, measuring, reporting, and managing strategic insurance and operational risks within their respective areas, consistent with enterprise risk management guidance.  Corporate risk committees and other management committees oversee the operational, global technology services, investment, and capital management risks on a corporate level.

Risk Appetite Policy

Our risk appetite policy describes the types of risks we are willing to take, as well as the amount of enterprise risk exposure we deem acceptable in pursuit of our goals, with an objective of clearly defining boundaries for our risk-taking activities.

The starting point of our philosophy and approach to our ERM strategy is our corporate strategy.  In contrast to many multi-line peer companies, we do not offer retirement savings, traditional medical benefits, or property and casualty insurance.  Our corporate strategy is focused on providing group, individual, and voluntary benefits, either as stand-alone products or combined with other coverages, that create comprehensive benefits solutions for employers.  We have market leadership positions in the product lines we offer and believe this combination of focused expertise and experience is a competitive advantage and forms the foundation of our approach to risk management.

We believe our sound and consistent business practices, strong internal compliance program, and comprehensive risk management strategy enable us to operate efficiently and to identify and address potential areas of risk in our business.  We take and manage risks to achieve our business and strategic objectives, and our risk appetite statement sets boundaries for risk-taking activities that link earnings, capital, and operational processes, as well as summarizes our most material risk limits and controls.


We monitor our risk profile against our established risk tolerance and limits.  Risks falling outside our risk tolerance and limits are reported to the applicable governance group, where decisions are made pertaining to acceptance of the risk or implementation of remediation plans or corrective actions as deemed appropriate by that governance group.

Risk Identification and Prioritization

Risk identification and prioritization is an ongoing process, whereby we identify and assess our risk positions and exposures, including notable risk events.  Additionally, we identify emerging risks and analyze how material future risks might affect us.  Knowing the potential risks we face, allows us to monitor and manage their potential effects including adjusting our strategies as appropriate and holding capital levels which provide financial flexibility.  Risk and other management committees have primary responsibility for identifying and prioritizing risks within their respective areas.

We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures.  For additional information on certain risks that may adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition see "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" contained herein on page 1 and "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A.

Risk Modeling and Controls

We assess material risks, including how they affect us and how individual risks interrelate, to provide valuable information to management in order that they may effectively manage our risks.  We use qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess existing and emerging risks and to develop mitigating strategies to limit our exposure to both.

We utilize stress testing and scenario analysis for risk management and to shape our business, financial, and strategic planning activities.  Both are key components of our risk appetite policy and play an important role in monitoring, assessing, managing, and mitigating our primary risk exposures.

In particular, stress testing of our capital and liquidity management strategies enables us to identify areas of high exposure, assess mitigating actions, develop contingency plans, and guide decisions around our target capital and liquidity levels.  For example, we periodically perform stress tests on certain categories of assets or liabilities to support development of capital and liquidity risk contingency plans.  These tests help ensure that we have a buffer to support our operations in uncertain times and financial flexibility to respond to market opportunities.  Stress testing is also central to reserve adequacy testing, cash flow testing, and asset and liability management.

In addition, we aim to constantly improve our capital modeling techniques and methodologies that are used to determine a level of capital that is commensurate with our risk profile and to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory and rating agency requirements.  Our capital modeling reflects appropriate aggregation of risks and diversification benefits resulting from our mix of products and business units.

Our internal capital modeling and allocation aids us in making significant business decisions including strategic planning, capital management, risk limit determination, reinsurance purchases, hedging activities, asset allocation, pricing, and corporate development.

Risk Management Activities

We accept and manage market, credit, insurance, operational and strategic risks in accordance with our corporate strategy, investment policy, and annual business plans.  The following fundamental principles are embedded in our risk management efforts across our Company.

•

We believe in the benefits of specialization and a focused business strategy.  We seek profitable risk-taking in areas where we have established risk management skills and capabilities.

•

We seek to manage our exposure to insurance risk through a combination of prudent underwriting with effective risk selection, maintaining pricing discipline, sound reserving practices, claims operational effectiveness, and selective use of reinsurance.  Detailed underwriting guidelines and claim policies are tools used to manage our insurance risk exposure.  We also monitor exposures against internally prescribed limits, and we diversify to reduce potential concentration risk and volatility.

•

We maintain a detailed set of investment policies and guidelines, including fundamental credit analysis, that are used to manage our credit risk exposure and diversify our risks across asset classes and issuers.


•

We value the importance of managing cyber-related risks, and have policies and procedures in place to help protect against insider trading and allow for timely disclosure of material cybersecurity events.

•

Finally, we foster a risk-aware culture that embeds our corporate values and our code of conduct in our daily operations and preserves our reputation with customers and other key stakeholders.  We monitor a composite set of operational risk metrics that measure operating effectiveness from the customer perspective.

Risk Reporting

Regular internal and external risk reporting is an integral part of our ERM framework.  Internally, ERM reports are a standard part of our quarterly senior management and board meetings.  The reports summarize our existing and emerging risk exposures, as well as report against the tolerances and limits defined by our risk appetite policy.

Externally, we are subject to a number of regulatory and rating agency risk examinations, and risk reports are often included.  Annually, we file our Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) summary report with the applicable insurance regulators for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.  This report provides strong evidence of the strengths of our ERM framework, measurement approaches, key assumptions utilized in assessing our risks, and prospective solvency assessments under both normal and stressed conditions.  See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1 for additional information regarding the ORSA.


ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Unum Group

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unum Group and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements").  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the consolidated results of operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 18, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

: The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Unum Group and its subsidiaries (the Company) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Such accounting principles differ from statutory accounting principles (see Note 16).  Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Description of Business

:  We are a leading provider of financial protection benefits in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland.  Our products include disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision, and other related services.  We market our products primarily through the workplace.

We have

three

principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life.  Our other reporting segments are Closed Block and Corporate.  See Note 13 for further discussion of our operating segments.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.

Fixed Maturity Securities

: Fixed maturity securities include long-term bonds and redeemable preferred stocks.  Our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, except for amounts related to other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings, are reported as a component of other comprehensive income.  These amounts are net of income tax and valuation adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and reserves for future policy and contract benefits which would have been recorded had the related unrealized gain or loss on these securities been realized.

Interest income is recorded as part of net investment income when earned, using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount.  Included within fixed maturity securities are mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.  We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities.  Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected.  The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income.  For fixed maturity securities on which collection of investment income is uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income when interest and dividends are received.  Payment terms specified for fixed maturity securities may include a prepayment penalty for unscheduled payoff of the investment.  Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received.

In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, we evaluate available information, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions.  In particular, we consider the strength of the issuer's balance sheet, its debt obligations and near-term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets.  Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary.  The significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.

If we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary, the investment is written down to fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period, either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income, as applicable.  Other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value.  For securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition.  For fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings, if through

subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income over the remaining life of the investment.  See Notes 2 and 3.

Mortgage Loans

:  Mortgage loans are generally held for investment and are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for probable losses.  Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate.  Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received.  For mortgage loans on which collection of interest income is uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of interest and recognize it in the period when an interest payment is received.  We typically do not resume the accrual of interest on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status until there are significant improvements in the underlying financial condition of the borrower.  We consider a loan to be delinquent if full payment is not received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.

We evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal credit quality rating based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan.  Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining impairment.  If we determine that it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of a mortgage loan, we establish an allowance for credit loss.  If we expect to foreclose on the property, the amount of the allowance typically equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the fair value of the underlying collateral.  If we expect to retain the mortgage loan until payoff, the allowance equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the expected future cash flows of the loan.  Additions and reductions to our allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans are reported as a component of net realized investment gains and losses.  We do not purchase mortgage loans with existing credit impairments.  See Note 3.

Policy Loans

:

Policy loans

are presented at unpaid balances directly related to policyholders.  Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate.  Included in policy loans are $

3,490.6

million and $

3,449.3

million of policy loans ceded to reinsurers at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Other Long-term Investments

:

Other long-term investments are comprised primarily of tax credit partnerships, private equity partnerships, and real estate.

Tax credit partnerships in which we have invested were formed for the purpose of investing in the construction and rehabilitation of low-income housing.  Because the partnerships are structured such that there is no return of principal, the primary sources of investment return from our tax credit partnerships are tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments, both of which may exhibit variability over the life of the investment.  These partnerships are accounted for using either the proportional or the effective yield method, depending primarily on whether the tax credits are guaranteed through a letter of credit, a tax indemnity agreement, or another similar arrangement.  Tax credits received from these partnerships are reported in our consolidated statements of income as either a reduction of premium tax or a reduction of income tax.  The amortization of the principal amount invested in these partnerships is reported as a component of either premium tax or income tax.

Our investments in private equity partnerships are passive in nature and represent funds that are primarily invested in private credit, private equity, and real assets.  We account for our investments in these partnerships using either the equity method or at fair value through net income depending on the level of ownership and the degree of our influence over partnership operating and financial policies.  For investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method, we report our investments at our share of the partnership's net asset value (NAV) and record our portion of partnership earnings as a component of net investment income.  For investments in partnerships accounted for at fair value through net income, we also report our investments at our share of the partnership's NAV as a practical expedient for fair value with increases or decreases recorded as a component of net investment income.  Distributions received from the funds arise from income generated by the underlying investments as well as the liquidation of the underlying investments and there is generally not a public market for these investments.

Real estate is primarily comprised of property held for the production of income and property held for sale.  Property held for the production of income is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any write-downs to fair value for impairment losses.  Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.  A review for impairment is made whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the property exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows generated from the property, at which point the carrying value is written down to an estimated fair value.  Real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of depreciated

cost or fair value less estimated selling costs and is not further depreciated once classified as such.  Our real estate balance was $

90.5

million and $

43.4

million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the associated accumulated depreciation was $

49.8

million and $

10.3

million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

See Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of our other long-term investments.

Short-term Investments

:

Short-term investments are carried at cost.  Short-term investments include investments maturing within one year of purchase, such as corporate commercial paper and U.S. Treasury bills, bank term deposits, and other cash accounts and cash equivalents earning interest.

Cash and Bank Deposits

: Cash and bank deposits include cash on hand and non-interest bearing cash and deposit accounts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

: Derivative financial instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recognized as either other long-term investments or other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are reported at fair value.  The accounting for a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging transaction, we formally document the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as the designation of the hedge as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.  Included in this documentation is how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risk(s) related to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions as well as a description of the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness.

A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk(s) of the hedged item.  Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship, using qualitative and quantitative methods.  Qualitative methods include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.  Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship.

Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value.  For gains or losses on the derivative instrument that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, those gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss and amortized into earnings in the same income statement line as the related hedged item.  The gain or loss on the termination of a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period in which the termination occurs.  When interest rate swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships, periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged items.

Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.  The gain or loss on the termination of an effective cash flow hedge is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.

Gains or losses on the termination of ineffective fair value or cash flow hedges are reported in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss.  In the event a hedged item is disposed of or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer likely to occur, we will terminate the related derivative and recognize the gain or loss on termination in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss.  In the event a hedged item is disposed of subsequent to the termination of the hedging transaction, we reclassify any remaining gain or loss on the hedge out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as a component of the same income statement line item wherein we report the gain or loss on disposition of the hedged item.

For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the fair value of the derivative, together with the payment of periodic fees, if applicable, are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Cash flow activity from the settlement of derivative contracts is reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a component of proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments.

In our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from those master netting agreements.  See Notes 2, 3, and 4.

Fair Value Measurement

: Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets and in our notes to our consolidated financial statements.  We define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Therefore, fair value represents an exit price, not an entry price.  The exit price objective applies regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date.  Assets or liabilities with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value.  When actively quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities, or other observable inputs.  If observable inputs are not available, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine fair value.  We categorize our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the significance of the inputs.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to inputs which are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  See Note 2.

Realized Investment Gains and Losses

: Realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and are based upon specific identification of the investments sold.  See Note 3.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

: Incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts have been deferred.  Such costs include commissions, other agency compensation, certain selection and policy issue expenses, and certain field expenses.  Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral.  Deferred acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing in subsequent years.

Deferred acquisition costs related to non-interest sensitive policies are amortized in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the lives of the policies.  Deferred acquisition costs related to interest sensitive policies are amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins.  Deviations from projections result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period during which such events occur.  Generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximate the estimated lives of the policies.

For certain products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights, or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract.  These transactions are known as internal replacement transactions.  Internal replacement transactions wherein the modification does not substantially change the policy are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts.  Unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy, and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred.  Internal replacement transactions, principally on group contracts, that result in a policy that is substantially changed are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy.  Unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed, and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs.

Loss recognition is performed on an annual basis, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as to future experience as of the date of the test.  Insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests.  If loss recognition testing indicates that deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable, the deficiency is charged to expense.

Goodwill

: Goodwill is the excess of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  We review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable.  Goodwill impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  The fair values of the reporting units are determined using discounted cash flow models.  The critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings and the discount rate.  We set our discount rate assumption based on an expected risk adjusted cost of capital.  If the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates is less than the carrying amount of the unamortized goodwill, the impairment charge is determined by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities.  The carrying amount of goodwill is then reduced with a corresponding charge to expense.

: Property and equipment is reported at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life.  The accumulated depreciation for property and equipment was $

1,195.3

million and $

1,151.8

million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Value of Business Acquired

: Value of business acquired represents the present value of future profits recorded in connection with the acquisition of a block of insurance policies.  The asset is amortized based upon expected future premium income for non-interest sensitive insurance policies and estimated future gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins for interest sensitive insurance policies.  The value of business acquired, which is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, was $

88.7

million and $

96.7

million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The accumulated amortization for value of business acquired was $

144.1

million and $

133.0

million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The amortization of value of business acquired, which is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income, was $

7.1

million, $

6.4

million, and $

4.8

million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  We periodically review the carrying amount of value of business acquired using the same methods used to evaluate deferred acquisition costs.

Policy and Contract Benefits

: Policy and contract benefits represent amounts paid and expected to be paid based on reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported losses for non-interest sensitive life and accident and health products.  For interest sensitive products, benefits are the amounts paid and expected to be paid on insured claims in excess of the policyholders' policy fund balances.

Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits

: Policy reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims not yet incurred.  Policy reserves for non-interest sensitive life and accident and health products are determined using the net level premium method.  The reserves are calculated based upon assumptions as to interest, persistency, morbidity, and mortality that were appropriate at the date of issue.  Discount rate assumptions are based on actual and expected net investment returns.  Persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations.  Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to morbidity and mortality are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations.  The assumptions vary by plan, year of issue, and policy duration and include a provision for adverse deviation.

Policy reserves for group single premium annuities are developed on a net single premium method.  The reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to interest, mortality, and retirement that were appropriate at the date of issue.  Mortality assumptions are based upon industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations.  The assumptions vary by year of issue.

Policy reserves for interest sensitive products are principally policyholder account values.

Policy reserves require ongoing loss recognition testing.  We perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test, without a provision for adverse deviation.  We group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests.  If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to

immediately recognize the deficiency.  This becomes the new basis for policy reserves going forward, subject to future loss recognition testing.

Claim reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us.  Our claim reserves relate primarily to disability and long-term care policies and are calculated based on assumptions as to interest and claim resolution rates that are currently appropriate.  Claim resolution rate assumptions are based on our actual experience.  The interest rate assumptions used for discounting claim reserves are based on projected portfolio yield rates, after consideration for defaults and investment expenses, for the assets supporting the liabilities for the various product lines.  Unlike policy reserves for which assumptions are generally established and locked in at the time of policy issuance, claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change.  Claim reserves do not include a provision for adverse deviation.  See Note 6.

Policyholders Funds

: Policyholders' funds represent customer deposits plus interest credited at contract rates.  We control interest rate risk by investing in quality assets which have an aggregate duration that closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities.

Income Tax

: Deferred taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Deferred taxes have been measured using enacted statutory income tax rates and laws that are currently in effect.  We record adjustments to our deferred taxes resulting from tax rate changes through income as of the date of enactment.  We record deferred tax assets for tax positions taken in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of whether a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits.  A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized.  We follow an aggregate portfolio approach to release disproportionate tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income upon disposal of an entire business segment's portfolio.  See Note 7.

Short-term and Long-term Debt

: Debt is generally carried at the unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discount or premium and deferred debt issuance costs.  Short-term debt consists of debt due within the next twelve months, including that portion of debt otherwise classified as long-term.  The amortization of the original issue discount or premium as well as deferred debt issuance costs are recognized as a component of interest expense over the period the debt is expected to be outstanding.  The carrying amount of long-term debt that is part of a fair value hedge program includes an adjustment to reflect the effect of the change in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.  Net interest settlements for fair value hedges on our long-term debt are recognized as a component of interest expense.  See Note 8.

Right-of-Use Asset (ROU) and Lease Liability

:  ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for a specified lease term and are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet.  Lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments that we are obligated to pay arising from a lease and are included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception through a formal process that evaluates our right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

We account for the lease and non-lease components of our building leases separately and have elected to use the available practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components of our equipment leases as a single component.

All of our leases are classified as operating, none of which are classified as short-term leases.  For each operating lease, we calculate a lease liability at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term and a corresponding ROU asset, adjusted for lease incentives.

We consider the likelihood of renewal in determining the lease terms for the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability.  As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of interest, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.  We use the implicit rate of interest when readily determinable.

Operating lease cost is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in other expenses in our consolidated statements of income.  We amortize the ROU asset over the lease term on a pattern determined by the difference between the straight-line lease liability expense and the accretion of the imputed interest calculated on the lease liability.  See Note 15.

Treasury Stock and Retirement of Common Stock

: Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost.  When shares are retired, the par value is removed from common stock, and the excess of the repurchase price over par is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.  See Note 10.

Revenue Recognition:

Our non-interest sensitive life and accident and health products are long-duration contracts, and premium income is recognized as revenue when due from policyholders.  If the contracts are experience rated, the estimated ultimate premium is recognized as revenue over the period of the contract.  The estimated ultimate premium, which is revised to reflect current experience, is based on estimated claim costs, expenses, and profit margins.

For interest sensitive products, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits, and only the deductions during the period for cost of insurance, policy administration, and surrenders are included in revenue.  Policyholders' funds represent funds deposited by contract holders and are not included in revenue.

Fees from our leave management services and administrative-services only (ASO) business are reported as other income when services are rendered.

Reinsurance

: We routinely enter into reinsurance agreements with other insurance companies to spread risk and thereby limit losses from large exposures.  For each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.

Reinsurance activity is accounted for on a basis consistent with the terms of the reinsurance contracts and the accounting used for the original policies issued.  Premium income and benefits and change in reserves for future benefits are presented in our consolidated statements of income net of reinsurance ceded.  Ceded liabilities for policy and contract benefits, future policy and contract benefits, and unearned premiums are reported on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets, as are ceded policy loans.  Our reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due from reinsurers under the terms of the reinsurance agreements for these ceded balances as well as settlement amounts currently due.

Where applicable, gains or losses on reinsurance transactions are deferred and amortized into earnings based upon expected future premium income for non-interest sensitive insurance policies and estimated future gross profits for interest sensitive insurance policies.  The deferred gain on reinsurance included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $

8.5

million and $

12.5

million, respectively.

Under ceded reinsurance agreements wherein we are not relieved of our legal liability to our policyholders, if the assuming reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations, we remain contingently liable.  We evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure.  We may also require assets in trust, letters of credit, or other acceptable collateral to support our reinsurance recoverable balances.  In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, certain amounts reported in our reinsurance recoverable could become uncollectible, in which case the reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance.  See Note 12.

Premium Tax Expense

: Premium tax expense is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income.  For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, premium tax expense was $

170.1

million, $

155.8

million, and $

158.0

million, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

: The cost of stock-based compensation is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  The Black-Scholes options valuation model is used for estimating the fair value of stock options, and the Monte-Carlo valuation model is used for estimating the fair value of performance share units.  Restricted stock units are valued based on the fair value of common stock at the grant date.  Stock-based awards are expensed over the requisite service period, or for performance share units over the requisite service period, or remaining service period, if and when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital in stockholders' equity.  Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur.  See Note 11.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Earnings Per Share

: We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Earnings per share assuming dilution is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of stock-based awards.  In computing earnings per share assuming dilution, only potential common shares resulting from stock-based awards that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per share) are included.  We use the treasury stock method to account for the effect of outstanding stock options and nonvested stock awards on the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution.  See Note 10.

Translation of Foreign Currency

: Revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates.  Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet dates.  The translation gain or loss is generally reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income tax.  We do not provide for deferred taxes to the extent unremitted foreign earnings are deemed permanently invested.

Accounting for Participating Individual Life Insurance

: Participating policies issued by one of our subsidiaries prior to its 1986 conversion from a mutual to a stock life insurance company will remain participating as long as the policies remain in-force.  A Participation Fund Account (PFA) was established for the benefit of all such individual participating life and annuity policies and contracts.  The assets of the PFA provide for the benefit, dividend, and certain expense obligations of the participating individual life insurance policies and annuity contracts.  The assets of the PFA were $

311.2

million and $

301.2

million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Description

Date of Adoption

Effect on Financial Statements

ASC 825 "Financial Instruments - Overall"

This update changed the accounting and disclosure requirements for certain financial instruments.  These changes include a requirement to measure equity investments, other than those that result in consolidation or are accounted for under the equity method, at fair value through net income unless the investment qualifies for certain practicability exceptions.  In addition, the update clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities.  Changes also included the modification of certain disclosures around the fair value of financial instruments, including the requirement for separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category, as well as the elimination of certain disclosures around methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value.  The guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.

January 1, 2018

The adoption of this update resulted in a cumulative-effect reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $17.5 million with a corresponding increase to retained earnings of $14.5 million, a decrease to other long-term investments of $3.8 million, and a decrease to deferred income tax liability of $0.8 million.

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Fair Value Measurements for Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value

We report fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities, derivative financial instruments, and unrestricted equity securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.  We report our investments in private equity partnerships at our share of the partnerships' net asset value per share or its equivalent (NAV) as a practical expedient for fair value.  See Note 1.

The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability.  Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value.  An active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available.  Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment.  Pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions.

We classify financial instruments in accordance with a fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels based on the observability of valuation inputs:

•

Level 1 - the highest category of the fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

•

Level 2 - valued using inputs (other than prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.

•

Level 3 - the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3 are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.

Valuation Methodologies of Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value

Valuation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.  The income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount.  The cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset, or the current replacement cost.

We use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort.  In some cases, a single valuation technique will be appropriate (for example, when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities).  In other cases, multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate.  If we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value, we evaluate and weigh the results, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results.  A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.

The selection of the valuation method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued.  For assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach.  We believe the market approach provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the type of investments we hold.  Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs.  When using a pricing service, we obtain the vendor's pricing documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies.  We periodically review and approve the selection of our


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

pricing vendors to ensure we are in agreement with their current methodologies.  When markets are less active, brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker.  Our internal investment management professionals, which include portfolio managers and analysts, monitor securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information.  In weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value, we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions.  We also consider the nature of the quote, particularly whether it is a bid or market quote.  If prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets, adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value.  When relevant market data is unavailable, which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty, the income approach can, in suitable circumstances, provide a more appropriate fair value.  During 2019, we have applied valuation approaches and techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those approaches and techniques used at year end 2018.

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

We use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our fixed maturity and equity securities.  For securities categorized as Level 1, fair values equal active Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) pricing or unadjusted broker market maker prices.  For securities categorized as Level 2 or Level 3, inputs that may be used in valuing each class of securities at any given time period are disclosed below.  Actual inputs used to determine fair values will vary for each reporting period depending on the availability of inputs which may, at times, be affected by the lack of market liquidity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

The management of our investment portfolio includes establishing pricing policy and reviewing the reasonableness of sources and inputs used in developing pricing.  We review all prices that vary between multiple pricing vendors by a threshold that is outside a normal market range for the asset type.  In the event we receive a vendor's market price that does not appear reasonable based on our market analysis, we may challenge the price and request further information about the assumptions and methodologies used by the vendor to price the security.  We may change the vendor price based on a better data source such as an actual trade.  We also review all prices that did not change from the prior month to ensure that these prices are within our expectations.  The overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price.  These adjustments may be made when, in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates, certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources.  These features may include the complexity of the financial instrument, the market in which the financial instrument is traded, counterparty credit risk, credit structure, concentration, or liquidity.  Additionally, an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument.  In the event an asset is sold, we test the validity of the fair value determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the selling price to the fair value determined for the asset in the immediately preceding month end reporting period.

Certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity.  For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value.  Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities.  Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

these securities include risk free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.

The parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis, as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing.  Changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies; rather, the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions.

At December 31, 2019, approximately

9.9

percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from TRACE pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security (comparable to receiving one binding quote).  The prices obtained were not adjusted, and the assets were classified as Level 1.

The remaining

90.1

percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on non-binding quotes or other observable and unobservable inputs, as discussed below:

•

77.0

percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques.  These assets were classified as Level 2.

•

9.1

percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more non-binding broker quotes, if validated by observable market data.  When only one price is available, it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate.  These assets, for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data, were classified as Level 2.

•

4.0

percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities, internal models, or pricing services or other non-binding quotes with no other observable market data.  These assets were classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data.

Derivatives

Fair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period.  We analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the LIBOR-setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives' fair values.  If net counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the LIBOR-based fair value obtained from our pricing sources, we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources.  For purposes of valuing net counterparty risk, we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position or transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  In regard to our own credit risk component, we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the LIBOR-based valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk.

Fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangement.

We consider transactions in inactive markets to be less representative of fair value.  We use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value, but when significant unobservable inputs are used, we classify these assets or liabilities as Level 3.

Private Equity Partnerships

Our private equity partnerships represent funds that are primarily invested in private credit, private equity, and real assets, as described below.  Distributions received from the funds arise from income generated by the underlying investments as well as the liquidation of the underlying investments.  There is generally not a public market for these investments.

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

(a)

Private Credit

- The limited partnerships described in this category employ various investment strategies, generally providing direct lending or other forms of debt financing including first-lien, second-lien, mezzanine, and subordinated loans.  The limited partnerships have credit exposure to corporates, physical assets, and/or financial assets within a variety of industries (including manufacturing, healthcare, energy, business services, technology, materials, and retail) in North America and, to a lesser extent, outside of North America.  As of December 31, 2019, the estimated remaining life of the investments that do not allow for redemptions is approximately 43 percent in the next 3 years, 25 percent during the period from 3 to 5 years, 30 percent during the period from 5 to 10 years, and 2 percent during the period from 10 to 15 years.

(b)

Private Equity

- The limited partnerships described in this category employ various strategies generally investing in controlling or minority control equity positions directly in companies and/or assets across various industries (including manufacturing, healthcare, energy, business services, technology, materials, and retail), primarily in private markets within North America and, to a lesser extent, outside of North America.  As of December 31, 2019, the estimated remaining life of the investments that do not allow for redemptions is approximately 34 percent in the next 3 years, 21 percent during the period from 3 to 5 years, 42 percent during the period from 5 to 10 years, and 3 percent during the period from 10 to 15 years.

(c)

Real Assets

- The limited partnerships described in this category employ various strategies, which include investing in the equity and/or debt financing of physical assets, including infrastructure (energy, power, water/wastewater, communications), transportation (including airports, ports, toll roads, aircraft, railcars) and real estate in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia.  As of December 31, 2019, the estimated remaining life of the investments that do not allow for redemptions is approximately 1 percent in the next 3 years, 20 percent during period from 3 to 5 years, 70 percent during the period from 5 to 10 years, and 9 percent during the period from 10 to 15 years.

Realized and unrealized investment gains and losses presented in the preceding tables represent gains and losses only for the time during which the applicable financial instruments were classified as Level 3.  The transfers between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of the securities transferred: (1) transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades, (2) broker/dealer quotes and pricing, primarily related to changes in the level of activity in the market and whether the market was considered orderly, and (3) comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis.  For fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of Level 3, we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the period.  We believe this allows for greater transparency, as all changes in fair value that arise during the reporting period of the transfer are disclosed as a component of our Level 3 reconciliation.  Gains (losses) which are included in earnings and are attributable to the change in fair value of assets or liabilities valued using significant unobservable inputs and still held at each year end were $

8.3

million and $(

15.2

) million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  These amounts relate entirely to the change in fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement and are reported as a component of realized investment gains and losses.

The table below provides quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements derived from internal models.  Certain securities classified as Level 3 are excluded from the table below due to limitations in our ability to obtain the underlying inputs used by external pricing sources.

(a)

Represents basis point adjustments to apply a discount due to the illiquidity of an investment

(b)

Represents basis point adjustments for credit-specific factors

(c)

Represents a decision to price based on par value, cost, or owner's equity when limited data is available

(d)

Represents various actuarial assumptions required to derive the liability cash flows including incidence, termination, and lapse rates

Isolated increases in unobservable inputs other than market convention will result in a lower fair value measurement, whereas isolated decreases will result in a higher fair value measurement.  The unobservable input for market convention is not sensitive to input movements.  The projected liability cash flows used in the fair value measurement of our Level 3 embedded derivative are based on expected claim payments.  If claim payments increase, the projected liability cash flows will increase, resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative.  Decreases in projected liability cash flows will result in an increase in the fair value of the embedded derivative.

Fair Value Measurements for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial instruments not carried at fair value are discussed as follows:

Mortgage Loans:

Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities.  Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations.

Policy Loans:

Fair values for policy loans, net of reinsurance ceded, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered to policyholders with similar policies.  Carrying amounts for ceded policy loans, which equal $

3,490.6

million and $

3,449.3

million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, approximate fair value and are reported on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets.  A change in interest rates for ceded policy loans will not impact our financial position because the benefits and risks are fully ceded to reinsuring counterparties.

Miscellaneous Long-term Investments:

Carrying amounts for tax credit partnerships equal the unamortized balance of our contractual commitments and approximate fair value.  Our shares of FHLB common stock are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Long-term Debt:

Fair values for long-term debt are obtained from independent pricing services or discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Funding Agreements:

Funding agreements with the FHLB represent cash advances used for the purpose of investing in fixed maturity securities.  Carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Unfunded Commitments to Investment Partnerships:

Unfunded equity commitments represent amounts that we have committed to fund certain investment partnerships.  These commitments are legally binding, subject to the partnerships meeting specified conditions.  Carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued

The carrying values of financial instruments such as short-term investments, cash and bank deposits, accounts and premiums receivable, accrued investment income, securities lending agreements, and short-term debt approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.  As such, these financial instruments are not included in the above chart.

Fair values for insurance contracts other than investment contracts are not required to be disclosed.  However, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

The following is a distribution of the maturity dates for fixed maturity securities.  The maturity dates have not been adjusted for possible calls or prepayments.

The following chart depicts an analysis of our fixed maturity security portfolio between investment-grade and below-investment-grade categories as of December 31, 2019:

The unrealized losses on investment-grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities.  Below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are generally more likely to develop credit concerns than investment-grade securities.  At December 31, 2019, the unrealized losses in our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities were generally due to credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and, to a lesser extent, credit concerns related to specific securities.  For each specific security in an unrealized loss position, we believe that there are positive factors which mitigate credit concerns and that the securities for which we have not recorded an other-than-temporary impairment will recover in value.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 3 - Investments - Continued

As of December 31, 2019, we held


individual investment-grade fixed maturity securities and


individual below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position, of which


investment-grade fixed maturity securities and


below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities had been in an unrealized loss position continuously for over one year.

In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, we evaluate the following factors:

•

Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security

•

Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis

•

Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments

•

The significance of the decline in value

•

The time period during which there has been a significant decline in value

•

Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings

•

The valuation of the security's underlying collateral

•

Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles

•

Market conditions

•

Rating agency and governmental actions

•

Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity

•

Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments

•

Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date

•

Any other key measures for the related security

While determining other-than-temporary impairments is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period.  The process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other-than-temporary impairment.

We held

no

fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.

At December 31, 2019, we had commitments of $

98.7

million to fund private placement fixed maturity securities, the amount of which may or may not be funded.

Variable Interest Entities

We invest in variable interests issued by variable interest entities.  These investments include tax credit partnerships, private equity partnerships, and special purpose entities.  For those variable interests that are not consolidated in our financial statements, we are not the primary beneficiary because we have neither the power to direct the activities that are most significant to economic performance nor the responsibility to absorb a majority of the expected losses.  The determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is performed at the time of our initial investment and at the date of each subsequent reporting period.

As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of our variable interest entity investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements was $

675.1

million, comprised of $

58.4

million of tax credit partnerships and $

616.7

million of private equity partnerships.  At December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of our variable interest entity investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements was $

575.3

million, comprised of $

91.5

million of tax credit partnerships and $

483.8

million of private equity partnerships.  These variable interest entity investments are reported as other long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.

The Company invests in tax credit partnerships primarily for the receipt of income tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments.  Amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of income are as follows:

Contractually, we are a limited partner in these tax credit partnerships, and our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment, which includes $

1.9

million of unfunded unconditional commitments at December 31, 2019.  See Note 2 for commitments to fund private equity partnerships.

As of December 31, 2018, we were the sole beneficiary of a special purpose entity which was consolidated in our financial statements.  This entity was a securitized asset trust that contained a highly rated bond for principal protection which we contributed into the trust at the time it was established.  There were no restrictions on the asset held in this trust, and the trust was free to dispose of the asset at any time.  The fair value of the bond was $

156.7

million as of December 31, 2018 and was reported as a component of fixed maturity securities in our consolidated balance sheets.  During the fourth quarter of 2019, the bond matured and the trust was dissolved.

Mortgage Loans

Our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration.  All of our mortgage loans are collateralized by commercial real estate.  When issuing a new loan, our general policy is not to exceed a loan-to-value ratio, or the ratio of the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, of


percent.  We update the loan-to-value ratios at least every

three

years for each loan, and properties undergo a general inspection at least every

two

years.  Our general policy for newly issued loans is to have a debt service coverage ratio greater than

1.25

times on a normalized


year amortization period.  We update our debt service coverage ratios annually.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 3 - Investments - Continued

Mortgage loans by property type and geographic region are presented below.

We evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal credit quality rating based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan.  The factors we use to derive our internal credit ratings may include the following:

•

Loan-to-value ratio

•

Debt service coverage ratio based on current operating income

•

Property location, including regional economics, trends and demographics

•

Age, condition, and construction quality of property

•

Current and historical occupancy of property

•

Lease terms relative to market

•

Tenant size and financial strength

•

Borrower's financial strength

•

Borrower's equity in transaction

•

Additional collateral, if any

Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining whether we will initially issue the loan and also in assigning values and determining impairment.  We assign an overall rating to each loan using an internal rating scale of AA (highest quality) to B (lowest quality).  We review and adjust, as needed, our internal credit quality ratings on an annual basis.  This review process is performed more frequently for mortgage loans deemed to have a higher risk of delinquency.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 3 - Investments - Continued

Mortgage loans, sorted by the applicable credit quality indicators, are as follows:

There were

no

troubled debt restructurings during 2019 or 2017.  We had

one

mortgage loan which was modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the second quarter of 2018.  The loan had a principal balance of $

3.6

million prior to the restructuring, wherein the terms of the loan were modified to reduce monthly payments to interest-only at the current note rate and to permit a discounted payoff by September 2018.  At time of restructuring, we recorded an allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans and recognized an impairment loss of $

0.2

million in the second quarter of 2018.  The payoff of the loan did not occur in September 2018 and the loan was considered impaired as of December 31, 2018.  The loan was settled during the first quarter of 2019 resulting in an additional loss of $

0.1

million.  At December 31, 2019, we held no mortgage loans that were greater than 90 days past due regarding principal and/or interest payments.

We had

no

realized losses on loan foreclosures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

There have been

no

changes to our accounting policies or methodology from the prior period regarding estimating the allowance for credit losses on our mortgage loans.  There was

no

activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017 other than the impairment losses and associated release of the allowance related to the previously discussed 2018 troubled debt restructuring.

Our average investment in impaired mortgage loans was $

0.6

million and $

2.3

million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  We did not hold any impaired mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2017.  We did not recognize any interest income during 2019, 2018 or 2017 on mortgage loans subsequent to impairment.

At December 31, 2019, we had commitments of $

56.0

million to fund certain commercial mortgage loans, the amount of which may or may not be funded.

Transfers of Financial Assets

To manage our cash position more efficiently, we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions.  We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments.  Our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than


days.  We post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later, specified date.  The fair value of collateral posted is generally


percent of the cash received.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 3 - Investments - Continued

Our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements.  These agreements increase our investment income with minimal risk.  Our securities lending policy requires that a minimum of


percent of the fair value of the securities loaned be maintained as collateral.  We may receive cash and/or securities as collateral under these agreements.  Cash received as collateral is typically reinvested in short-term investments.  If securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them.

As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities loaned to third parties under our securities lending program was $

176.4

million, for which we received collateral in the form of securities of $

186.5

million.  As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities loaned to third parties under our securities lending program was $

164.1

million, for which we received collateral in the form of cash and securities of $

0.1

million and $

171.4

million, respectively.  We had

no

outstanding repurchase agreements at December 31, 2019 or 2018.

The remaining contractual maturities of our securities lending agreements disaggregated by class of collateral pledged are as follows:

Certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of regional FHLBs.  Membership, which requires that we purchase a minimum amount of FHLB common stock on which we receive dividends, provides access to low-cost funding.  Advances received from the FHLB are used for the purchase of fixed maturity securities.  Additional common stock purchases may be required, based on the amount of funds we borrow from the FHLBs.

The carrying value of common stock owned, collateral posted, and advances received are as follows:

Offsetting of Financial Instruments

We enter into master netting agreements with each of our derivatives counterparties.  These agreements provide for conditional rights of set-off upon the occurrence of an early termination event.  An early termination event is considered a default, and it allows the non-defaulting party to offset its contracts in a loss position against any gain positions or payments due to the defaulting party.  Under our agreements, default type events are defined as failure to pay or deliver as contractually agreed, misrepresentation, bankruptcy, or merger without assumption.  See Note 4 for further discussion of collateral related to our derivative contracts.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 3 - Investments - Continued

We have securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to us in return for the use of our fixed maturity securities.  A right of set-off exists that allows us to keep and apply collateral received in the event of default by the counterparty.  Default within a securities lending agreement would typically occur if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from us as contractually agreed.  In addition, if we default by not returning collateral received, the counterparty has a right of set-off against our securities or any other amounts due to us.

Shown below are our financial instruments that either meet the accounting requirements that allow them to be offset in our balance sheets or that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.  Our accounting policy is to not offset these financial instruments in our balance sheets.  Net amounts disclosed below have been reduced by the amount of collateral pledged to or received from our counterparties.

Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments

Purpose of Derivatives

We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations.  The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk, risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities, foreign currency risk, and credit risk.

Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps, current and forward currency swaps, forward benchmark interest rate locks, currency forward contracts, forward contracts on specific fixed income securities, and credit default swaps.  Transactions hedging interest rate risk are primarily associated with our individual and group long-term care and individual and group disability products.  All other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as follows:

•

Interest rate swaps

are used to hedge interest rate risks and to improve the matching of assets and liabilities.  An interest rate swap is an agreement in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts.  We use interest rate swaps to hedge the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities thereby protecting us from the potential adverse impact of declining interest rates on the associated policy reserves.  We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the potential adverse impact of rising interest rates in anticipation of issuing fixed rate long-term debt.

•

Forward benchmark interest rate locks

are used to minimize interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase or disposal of fixed maturity securities or debt.  A forward benchmark interest rate lock is a derivative contract without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to purchase or sell a specific benchmark interest rate fixed maturity bond at a future date at a pre-determined price.

Derivatives designated as fair value hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as follows:

•

Interest rate swaps

are used to effectively convert certain of our fixed rate securities into floating rate securities which are used to fund our floating rate long-term debt.  Under these swap agreements, we receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest.  Additionally, we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert certain fixed rate, long-term debt into floating rate long-term debt.  Under these swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest.

Derivatives designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk are as follows:

•

Foreign currency interest rate swaps

are used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification.  Under these swap agreements, we agree to pay, at specified intervals, fixed rate foreign currency-denominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment.

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk, credit losses on securities owned, and interest rate risk are as follows:

•

Foreign currency interest rate swaps

previously designated as hedges were used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification.  These derivatives were effective hedges prior to novation to a new counterparty.  In conjunction with the novation, these derivatives were de-designated as hedges.  We agree to pay, at specified intervals, fixed rate foreign currency-denominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment.  We hold offsetting swaps wherein we agree to pay fixed rate principal and interest payments in the functional currency of the operating segment in exchange for fixed rate foreign currency-denominated payments.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Unum Group and Subsidiaries

Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued

•

Credit default swaps

are used as economic hedges against credit risk but do not qualify for hedge accounting.  A credit default swap is an agreement in which we agree with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a fixed-rate fee in exchange for insurance against a credit event on a specific investment.  If a defined credit event occurs, our counterparty may either pay us a net cash settlement, or we may surrender the specific investment to them in exchange for cash equal to the full notional amount of the swap.  Credit events typically include events such as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or certain types of debt restructuring.

•

Interest rate swap

was used to effectively convert certain of our floating rate, long-term debt into fixed rate long-term debt.  Under this swap agreement, we received a variable rate of interest and paid a fixed rate of interest.

•

Foreign currency forward

contracts are used to minimize foreign currency risk.  A foreign currency forward is a derivative without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to exchange a specific amount of currencies, at a specific exchange rate, on a specific date.  We use these forward contracts to hedge the currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated securities.

Derivative Risks

The basic types of risks associated with derivatives are market risk (that the value of the derivative will be adversely impacted by changes in the market, primarily the change in interest and exchange rates) and credit risk (that the counterparty will not perform according to the terms of the contract).  The market risk of the derivatives should generally offset the market risk associated with the hedged financial instrument or liability.  To help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position.  We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives.  These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount.  Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held.  At December 31, 2019, we had

no

credit exposure on derivatives.  Our credit exposure on derivatives was $

0.9

million at December 31, 2018.

The table below summarizes the nature and amount of collateral received from and posted to our derivative counterparties.

See Note 3 for further discussion of our master netting agreements.

The majority of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain specified issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings.  Should our ratings fall below these specified levels, we would be in violation of the provisions, and our derivatives counterparties could terminate our contracts and request immediate payment.  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was $

34.6

million and $

38.0

million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Derivative Transactions

The table below summarizes, by notional amounts, the activity for each category of derivatives.  The notional amounts represent the basis upon which our counterparty pay and receive amounts are calculated.

Cash Flow Hedges

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $

213.5

million and $

286.4

million, respectively, notional amount of receive fixed, pay fixed, open current and forward foreign currency interest rate swaps to hedge fixed income foreign currency-denominated securities.

During the third quarter of 2019, we entered into a $

350.0

million notional forward benchmark interest rate lock in order to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the cash flows related to the tender offer and early redemption of certain of our debt securities.  We terminated the interest rate lock during 2019 and recognized a loss of $

0.5

million that was reported with the $

5.3

million tender premium as a cost related to the early retirement of debt in our statement of income.  See Note 8 for further discussion of the tender offer and early redemption of certain of our debt securities.

As of December 31, 2019, we expect to amortize approximately $

76.2

million of net deferred gains on derivative instruments during the next twelve months.  This amount will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item.  The income statement line items that will be affected by this amortization are net investment income and interest and debt expense.  Additional amounts that may be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings to offset the earnings impact of foreign currency translation of hedged items are not estimable.

As of December 31, 2019, we are hedging the variability of future cash flows associated with forecasted transactions through the year 2045.

Fair Value Hedges

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $

249.4

million and $

78.1

million notional amount of receive fixed, pay fixed, open current and forward foreign currency interest rate swaps to hedge fixed income foreign currency-denominated securities.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $

250.0

million notional amount of receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate long-term debt.  These swaps effectively convert the associated fixed rate

long-term debt into floating rate debt and provide for a better matching of interest rates with our short-term investments, which have frequent interest rate resets similar to a floating rate security.

The following table summarizes the carrying amount of hedged assets and liabilities and the related cumulative basis adjustments related to our fair value hedges:

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, $

2.0

million and $

2.5

million, respectively, of the derivative instruments' gain was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  There were

no

instances wherein we discontinued fair value hedge accounting due to a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying as a fair value hedge.

Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held $

148.2

million and $

173.7

million, respectively, notional amount of receive fixed, pay fixed, foreign currency interest rate swaps.  These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and as such, changes in fair value related to these derivatives are reported in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held $

11.4

million and $

11.0

million, respectively, notional amount of single name credit default swaps.  We entered into these swaps in order to mitigate the credit risk associated with specific securities owned.

As of December 31, 2019, we held $

8.9

million notional amount of foreign currency forwards to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with specific securities owned.

As of December 31, 2016, we held $

3.5

million notional amount of receive variable, pay fixed interest rate swap acquired through our purchase of Starmount during 2016.  This swap effectively converted Starmount's floating rate long-term debt into fixed rate debt.  During 2017, we purchased and retired the debt and terminated the interest rate swap.  We recorded a loss of $

0.1

million on the swap termination in our consolidated statements of income as a component of net realized investment gains and losses.  See Note 8.

We have an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement for which we include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us.  However, neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision, delinquency proceedings, or other direct regulatory action.  Cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract.  There are no credit-related counterparty triggers, and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down.

Interest accrued on prior year reserves has been calculated on the opening reserve balance less one-half of the year’s claim payments relative to prior years at our average reserve discount rate for the respective periods.

"Incurred Related to Prior Years - All Other Incurred" shown in the preceding chart includes the reserve adjustments as discussed in the following paragraphs, which impact the comparability between the years presented.  Excluding those adjustments, the variability exhibited year over year is primarily caused by the level of claim resolutions in the period relative to the long-term expectations reflected in the reserves.  Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably.

2018 Long-term Care Reserve Increase

Policy reserves for our long-term care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and, prior to the third quarter of 2018, were valued based on assumptions established as of December 31, 2014, the date of our last assumption update under loss recognition.  Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient.  We undertake a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review.

Note 6 - Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

During the third quarter of 2018, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions, including active policy terminations, claims incidence, claim terminations, morbidity, premium rate increases, and new money yield rates.  The review utilized internal and external data and outside consulting firms for quality assurance and industry benchmarking.  Based on our analysis, during the third quarter of 2018, we updated our reserve assumptions and determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $

750.8

million, or $

593.1

million after tax, to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations.  This increase was primarily driven by the update to our liability and interest rate assumptions, particularly claims incidence and claim termination rates, which resulted in an increase to reserves of approximately $2.2 billion.  Partially offsetting the increase was the update to our assumptions for premium rate increases which decreased reserves approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in the net increase to reserves of $

750.8

million.  Of this amount, approximately $


million was related to our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, which can be primarily attributed to prior year incurred claims, thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart.

2017 Unclaimed Death Benefits Reserve Increase

Similar to other insurers, we were the subject of an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states.  We cooperated fully with this examination and in the fourth quarter of 2017, we started the process to reach a Global Resolution Agreement with the third party regarding settlement of the examination, which we finalized in January of 2018.  Under the terms of the agreement, the third party acting on behalf of the signatory states compared insured data to the Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify deceased insureds and contract holders where a valid claim has not been made.  During the fourth quarter of 2017, we established reserves which reflect our estimate of the liability expected to be paid as we execute on the terms of the settlement.  Claim reserves were increased $

18.5

million for Unum US group life, $

8.1

million for Unum US voluntary life, and $

12.4

million for Colonial Life voluntary life, for a total reserve increase of $

39.0

million before tax.  The reserves established were attributed to prior years incurred claims, thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart.

Reconciliation

A reconciliation of policy and contract benefits and reserves for future policy and contract benefits as reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is as follows:

The adjustment related to unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the changes that would be necessary to policyholder liabilities if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the corresponding available-for-sale securities had been realized.  Changes in this adjustment are reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss.

Note 7 - Income Tax - Continued

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal government enacted the TCJA, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.  Although the TCJA's 21 percent corporate tax rate became effective on January 1, 2018, we are required to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities through continuing operations on the date of enactment.  As a result, in 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $

97.9

million for the TCJA's corporate tax rate reduction and an income tax expense of $

66.4

million for the deemed repatriation transition tax on accumulated foreign E&P.

TCJA brought a large number of complex changes to many areas of the tax code.  The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) allowing a one-year measurement period after the enactment date of TCJA to finalize the calculation and record the related tax impacts.  We finalized and recorded adjustments to our initial estimates during 2018.  As a result of guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we recorded additional deemed repatriation transition tax on accumulated foreign E&P of $

11.5

million, for a total of $77.9 million.  We recorded no other material changes to our calculations of the impact of the TCJA during the one-year measurement period after the enactment period as allowed by SAB 118.

Effective January 1, 2018, the TCJA created a U.S. shareholder tax on certain foreign subsidiary income above a routine equity return on tangible depreciable business assets, or a tax on Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (GILTI).  The Financial Accounting Standards Board has provided additional guidance to address the accounting effects of GILTI, requiring companies to elect to either recognize deferred taxes related to GILTI or include in tax expense in the period incurred.  We have elected to treat GILTI as a period cost.

Under the TCJA, a modified territorial tax system was adopted that required a one-time Deemed Repatriation Tax on accumulated foreign E&P.  Future repatriation of foreign E&P subject to the one-time Deemed Repatriation Tax will not be subject to further U.S. taxation other than tax on foreign currency translation gain or loss.  As of December 31, 2019, our plans for the future repatriations of cash from our foreign subsidiaries include only the amount of capital above that which is required by Solvency II.  The remainder of our investment in our foreign subsidiaries is indefinitely reinvested and we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the approximately $

0.7

billion of the excess of the U.S. GAAP carrying values over the tax basis of investments in our foreign subsidiaries.

Our consolidated statements of income include the following changes in unrecognized tax benefits.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year reporting.

During 2018, we recorded $

261.1

million gross unrecognized tax benefits for a policyholder reserves position taken on our 2017 federal tax return, which if recognized, would decrease our tax expense by $112.9 million.  The balances of unrecognized tax benefits for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility are $127.1 million and $148.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  It is reasonably possible that this item could reverse in the next 12 months following review by the IRS.  We recognize interest expense and penalties, if applicable, related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense.  We recognized $

12.8

million of interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits during 2019 and a de minimis amount in 2018 and 2017.  We held corresponding liabilities related to this interest expense in our consolidated balance sheets.

We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.  Tax years subsequent to 2014 remain subject to examination by the IRS.  Tax years subsequent to 2015 remain subject to examination by the IRS for the subsidiaries not included in the consolidated tax return.  All other major foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years subsequent to 2017 with the exception of Poland for which tax years subsequent to 2013 remain subject to examination.  We believe sufficient provision has been made for all potential adjustments for years that are not closed by the statute of limitations in all major tax jurisdictions and that any such adjustments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

We file state income tax returns in nearly every state in the United States.  Tax years subsequent to 2014 remain subject to examination depending on the statute of limitation established by the various states, which is generally three to four years.  Tax years subsequent to 2010 remain subject to examination in California.

We have accumulated federal net operating loss carryforwards of $

10.6

million and $

6.5

million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Current year net operating losses relate to subsidiaries not yet included in the consolidated U.S. federal tax return and are not expected to expire unused.  Our federal capital loss carryforward, also related to subsidiaries not included in the consolidated U.S. federal return, was $

0.7

million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 and is expected to be utilized by the time it expires in 2022.  We have net operating loss carryforwards for state and local income tax of approximately $


million, most of which is expected to expire unused between 2020 and 2039.

We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  Our valuation allowance was $

28.3

million and $

18.4

million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the majority of which related to our cumulative deferred state income tax benefits.  The de minimis remaining amount of our valuation allowance relates to unrealized tax losses on buildings which we own and occupy in the U.K.  We recorded a decrease in our valuation allowance in 2018 of $

1.9

million and an increase of $

9.9

million during 2019, primarily in other comprehensive income.

Total income taxes paid net of refunds during 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $

Senior Secured Notes

In 2007, Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unum Group, issued $

800.0

million of insured, senior secured notes (the Northwind notes) in a private offering.  The Northwind notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus

0.78

%.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Note 8 - Debt - Continued

Northwind Holdings’ ability to meet its obligations to pay principal, interest, and other amounts due on the Northwind notes will be dependent principally on its receipt of dividends from Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re), the sole subsidiary of Northwind Holdings.  Northwind Re reinsured the risks attributable to specified individual disability insurance policies issued by or reinsured by Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, Unum Life Insurance Company of America, and The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company (collectively, the ceding insurers) pursuant to separate reinsurance agreements between Northwind Re and each of the ceding insurers.  The ability of Northwind Re to pay dividends to Northwind Holdings will depend on its satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and the performance of the reinsured policies.

Recourse for the payment of principal, interest and other amounts due on the Northwind notes is limited to the collateral for the Northwind notes and the other assets, if any, of Northwind Holdings.  The collateral consists of a first priority, perfected security interest in (a) the debt service coverage account (DSCA) that Northwind Holdings is required to maintain in accordance with the indenture pursuant to which the Northwind notes were issued (the Northwind indenture), (b) the capital stock of Northwind Re and the dividends and distributions on such capital stock, and (c) Northwind Holdings' rights under the transaction documents related to the Northwind notes to which Northwind Holdings is a party.  At December 31, 2019, the amount in the DSCA was $

64.3

million.  None of Unum Group, the ceding insurers, Northwind Re, or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor with respect to the Northwind notes.

Northwind Holdings is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal under the Northwind notes at par on the quarterly scheduled payment dates under the Northwind notes in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) a targeted amortization amount as defined in the Northwind indenture and (ii) the amount of the remaining available funds in the DSCA minus an amount equal to the minimum balance that is required to be maintained in the DSCA under the Northwind indenture, provided that Northwind Holdings has sufficient funds available to pay its other expenses, including interest payments on the Northwind notes, and to maintain the minimum balance in the DSCA as required under the Northwind indenture.  Northwind Holdings made principal payments on the Northwind notes of $

60.0

million in each of 2019, 2018, and 2017.

In 2017, we purchased and retired the remaining $

3.4

million of principal on our senior secured floating rate notes acquired through our purchase of Starmount Life Insurance Company.  In conjunction with this retirement, we also terminated the interest rate swap associated with the hedge of these notes and recorded a $

0.1

million loss in our consolidated statements of income as a component of net realized investment gains and losses.  See Note 4 for further discussion on the interest rate swap.

Unsecured Notes

During 2019 we purchased and retired (i) $

30.3

In September 2019, we issued $

450.0

million of

4.500

% senior notes due 2049.

The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

In June 2019, we issued $

Fair Value Hedges

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $

% junior subordinated notes due 2058.  The notes are redeemable at or above par on or after June 15, 2023 and rank equally in the right of payment with our other junior subordinated debt securities.

In 1998, Provident Financing Trust I (the Trust), a


percent-owned finance subsidiary of Unum Group, issued $

300.0

million of

7.405

% capital securities due 2038 in a public offering.  These capital securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Unum Group, have a liquidation value of $

1,000

per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances.  In connection with the capital securities offering, Unum Group issued to the Trust

7.405

% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due 2038.  The Trust is a variable interest entity of which Unum Group is not the primary beneficiary.  Accordingly, the capital securities issued by the Trust are not included in our consolidated financial statements and our liability represents the junior subordinated debt securities owed to the trust which is recorded in long-term debt.  The sole assets of the Trust are the junior subordinated debt securities.  The retirement of any liquidation amount regarding the capital securities by the Trust results in a corresponding retirement of principal amount of the junior subordinated debt securities.

During 2019, the Trust purchased and retired $

22.8

million aggregate liquidation amount of the

7.405

% capital securities due 2038, which resulted in our purchase and retirement of a corresponding principal amount of our

7.405

% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038.

Cost Related to Early Retirement of Debt

During 2019, we incurred costs of $

27.3

million related to the early retirement of certain of our unsecured notes and junior subordinated debt securities as previously discussed.

Interest Paid

Interest paid on long-term and short-term debt and related securities during 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $

172.9

million, $

167.3

million, and $

154.4

million, respectively.

Credit Facilities

In April 2019, we amended the terms of our existing five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing it from $400.0 million to $

500.0

million.  The credit facility, which was previously set to expire in 2021, was extended through April 2024.  Under the terms of the amended agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $700.0 million, up from the previous amount of $600.0 million.  We also may request, on up to two occasions, that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year.  The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations.  At December 31, 2019, letters of credit totaling $0.6 million had been issued from the credit facility, but there were

no

borrowed amounts outstanding.

Also in April 2019, we separately entered into a three-year, $

100.0

million unsecured revolving credit facility with a different syndicate of lenders, which is set to expire in April 2022.  Under the terms of the agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $140.0 million.  We also may request that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year.  The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations.  At December 31, 2019, there have been

no

letters of credit issued from the credit facility and there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.

Borrowings under the credit facilities are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary.  The two primary financial covenants include limitations based on our leverage ratio and consolidated net worth.  We are also subject to covenants that limit subsidiary indebtedness.  The credit facilities provide for borrowings at an interest rate based either on the prime rate or LIBOR.

Note 9 - Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit (OPEB) Plans

We sponsor several defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans.  The U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and benefit cost.  We maintain a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees in our U.K. operation.  The U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants on December 31, 2013, the OPEB plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2012, and the U.K. plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2002.

Amendments to Pension Plan

In 2017, we amended our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan by modifying the qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity form of payment for married participants from a 67 percent joint and survivor annuity to a 100 percent joint and survivor benefit to the participant's spousal beneficiary in the event a participant pre-deceased prior to reaching pension eligibility and affirmatively electing a form of benefit.  This amendment became effective January 1, 2018.  As a result of this amendment, we recognized an increase in the net pension liability of $

7.6

million, with a corresponding prior service cost included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

U.S. Pension Plan Annuity Purchases

On December 26, 2019, we purchased a group annuity contract which transferred a portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation to a third party.  Under the transaction, which was funded with plan assets, we transferred the responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 1,900 retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than $350 in monthly benefit payments from the plan.  This transfer resulted in a reduction in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation of $

59.5

million at December 31, 2019 and is reflected in the Benefits and Expenses Paid line item within the following table regarding changes in our benefit obligation.

On January 2, 2020, in a separate transaction, we purchased a second group annuity contract which transferred an additional portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation to the same third party.  Under the transaction, which was funded with plan assets, we transferred the responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 600 retirees or their beneficiaries receiving between $350 and $500 in monthly benefit payments from the plan.  This transfer will reduce our 2020 U.S. qualified benefit pension plan obligation by approximately $

44.0

million.

Amortization Period of Actuarial Gain or Loss and Prior Service Cost or Credit

Because all participants in the U.S. and U.K. pension plans are considered inactive, we amortize the net actuarial loss and prior service credit for these plans over the average remaining life expectancy of the plans.  As of December 31, 2019, the estimate of the average remaining life expectancy of the plans was approximately


years for the U.S. plan and


years for U.K. plan.

The following table provides the changes recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Plan Assets

The objective of our U.S. pension and OPEB plans is to maximize long-term return, within acceptable risk levels, in a manner that is consistent with the fiduciary standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), while maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and expenses.

Our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan assets include a diversified blend of domestic, international, global, and emerging market equity securities, fixed income securities, opportunistic credit securities, real estate investments, alternative investments, and cash equivalents.  Equity securities are comprised of funds and individual securities that are benchmarked against the respective indices specified below.  International and global equity funds may allocate a certain percentage of assets to forward currency contracts.  Fixed income securities include U.S. government and agency asset-backed securities, corporate investment-grade bonds, private placement securities, and bonds issued by states or other municipalities.  Opportunistic credits

Note 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued

consist of investments in funds that hold varied fixed income investments purchased at depressed values with the intention to later sell those investments for a gain.  Real estate investments consist primarily of funds that hold commercial real estate investments.  Alternative investments, which include private equity direct investments, private equity funds of funds, and hedge funds of funds, utilize proprietary strategies that are intended to have a low correlation to the U.S. stock market.  Prohibited investments include, but are not limited to, unlisted securities, options, short sales, and investments in securities issued by Unum Group or its affiliates.  The invested asset classes, asset types, and benchmark indices for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is as follows.  We target approximately


percent to equity securities,


percent to fixed income securities, and


percent to opportunistic credits, alternative, and real estate investments.

Assets for our U.K. pension plan are primarily invested in a pooled diversified growth fund.  This fund invests in assets such as global equities, hedge funds, commodities, below-investment-grade fixed income securities, and currencies.  The objectives of the fund are to generate capital appreciation over the course of a complete economic and market cycle and to deliver equity-like returns in the medium-to-long term while maintaining approximately two thirds of the volatility of equity markets.  Performance of this fund is measured against the U.K. inflation rate plus four percent.  The remaining assets in the U.K. plan are invested in leveraged interest rate and inflation gilt funds of varying durations designed to broadly match the interest rate and inflation sensitivities of the plan's liabilities.  The current target allocation for the assets is


percent diversified growth assets and


percent interest rate and inflation gilt funds.  There are no categories of investments that are specifically prohibited by the U.K. plan, but there are general guidelines that ensure prudent investment action is taken.  Such guidelines include the prevention of the plan from using derivatives for speculative purposes and limiting the concentration of risk in any one type of investment.

Assets for the OPEB plan are invested in life insurance contracts issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries.  The assets support life insurance benefits payable to certain former retirees covered under the OPEB plan.  The terms of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with those the subsidiary offers to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated.  There are no categories of investments specifically prohibited by the OPEB plan.

We believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector, with no undue risk concentrations in any one category.

Level 1 investments consist of individual holdings that are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical securities.  Level 2 investments consist of individual holdings that are valued using observable inputs through market corroborated pricing.

Certain equity, opportunistic credit, and real estate investments are valued based on the NAV of the underlying holdings.  We made no adjustments to the NAV for 2019 or 2018.  These investments have no unfunded commitments and no specific redemption restrictions.

Alternative investments are valued based on NAV in a period ranging from one month to one quarter in arrears.  We evaluate the need for adjustments to the NAV based on market conditions and discussions with fund managers in the period subsequent to the valuation date and prior to issuance of the financial statements.  We made no adjustments to the NAV for 2019 or 2018.  The private equity direct investments and private equity funds of funds generally cannot be redeemed by investors.  Distributions of capital from the sale of underlying fund assets may occur at any time, but are generally concentrated between

five

and

eight years

from the formation of the fund.

Measurement Assumptions

We use a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans.  The weighted average assumptions

used in the measurement of our benefit obligations as of December 31 and our net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

We set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement-related benefit plans at the measurement date to reflect the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments matched against the projected cash flows for future benefits.

Our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is selected from a range of probable return outcomes from an analysis of the asset portfolio.  Our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance, evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists, and current market yields.  The methodology underlying the return assumption includes the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long-term rates of return, volatility of returns, and the correlation of returns between various asset classes.  The expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan's strategic asset allocation.  Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.  Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.

Our mortality rate assumption reflects our best estimate, as of the measurement date, of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments.  We derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables.

The expected return assumption for the life insurance reserve for our OPEB plan is based on full investment in fixed income securities with an average book yield of

4.74

percent and

4.73

percent in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The rate of compensation increase assumption for our U.K. pension plan is generally based on periodic studies of compensation trends.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health care benefits assumed for the next calendar year are

6.50

percent and

7.00

percent, respectively, for benefits payable to both retirees prior to Medicare eligibility as well as Medicare eligible retirees.  The rates are assumed to change gradually to

5.00

percent by


for measurement at December 31, 2019 and remain at that level thereafter.  The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health benefits do not apply to retirees whose postretirement health care benefits are provided through an exchange.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

The following table provides the components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the years ended December 31.

The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is included as a component of compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income.  All other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost are included in other expenses.

A one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate at December 31, 2019 would have increased (decreased) the service cost and interest cost by a de minimis amount, respectively, and the postretirement benefit obligation by $

0.5

million and $(

0.5

) million, respectively.

The unrecognized net actuarial loss and the prior service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive income and expected to be amortized and included in net periodic pension cost during 2020 is $

19.8

million and $

million before tax, respectively.

Funding Policy

The funding policy for our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan is to contribute annually an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contribution required under ERISA and other applicable laws, but generally not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.

We had no regulatory contribution requirements for our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in 2019

and made a de minimis amount of voluntary contributions during 2019

.

We do not expect to make any contributions in 2020.  The funding policy for our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plan is to contribute the amount of the benefit payments made during the year.  Our expected return on plan assets and discount rate will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our U.S. pension plan because such contributions are determined under the minimum funding requirements as set forth in ERISA.

We made

no

contributions to our U.K. plan during 2019, nor do we expect to make any contributions in 2020, either voluntary or those required to meet the minimum funding requirements under U.K. legislation.

Our OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and dental benefits.  It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan.

Defined Contribution Plans

We offer a 401(k) plan to all eligible U.S. employees under which a portion of employee contributions is matched.  We match dollar-for-dollar up to

5.0

percent of base salary and any recognized sales and performance-based incentive compensation for employee contributions into the plan.  We also make an additional non-elective contribution of

4.5

percent of earnings for all eligible employees and a separate transition contribution for eligible employees who met certain age and years of service criteria as of December 31, 2013.  The 401(k) plan remains in compliance with ERISA guidelines and continues to qualify for a “safe harbor” from annual discrimination testing.

We also offer a defined contribution plan to all eligible U.K. employees under which a portion of employee contributions is matched.  We match

two

pounds for every one pound on the first

1.0

percent

of employee contributions into the plan and match additional employee contributions pound-for-pound up to

5.0

percent of base salary.  We also make an additional non-elective contribution of

6.0

percent of base salary for all eligible employees who met certain age and years of service criteria as of March 31, 2016.

During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized costs of $

77.3

million, $

72.7

million, and $

78.4

million, respectively, for our U.S. defined contribution plan.  We recognized costs of $

4.4

million in 2019 and $

4.2

million in both 2018 and 2017 for our U.K. defined contribution plan.

Note 10 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Common Share

Earnings Per Common Share

Net income per common share is determined as follows:

We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  In computing earnings per share assuming dilution, we include potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per share).  We use the treasury stock method to account for the effect of outstanding stock options, nonvested restricted stock units, and nonvested performance share units on the computation of diluted earnings per share.  Potential common shares not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would be antidilutive, approximated

Performance Share Units (PSUs)

Activity for PSUs classified as equity is as follows:

During 2019, 2018, and 2017, we issued PSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $

41.57

, $

44.19

, and $

51.37

, respectively.  Vesting for the PSUs occurs at the end of a three-year period and is contingent upon our achievement of prospective company performance goals and our total shareholder return relative to a board-approved peer group during the

three

-year period.  Actual performance, including modification for relative total shareholder return, may result in the ultimate award of


to


percent of the initial number of PSUs issued, with the potential for no award if company performance goals are not achieved during the three-year period.  Forfeitable dividend equivalents on PSUs are accrued in the form of additional PSUs.

PSU shares in the preceding table represent aggregate initial target awards and accrued dividend equivalents and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the application of the performance factor determined after the end of the performance periods.  At December 31, 2019, the

three

-year performance period for the 2017 PSU grant was completed and the related shares vested, but the performance factor had not yet been applied.  The performance factor will be applied during the first quarter of 2020, with distribution of the stock thereafter.  Granted and vested amounts in the preceding table also include an adjustment to reflect the application of the performance factor to the 2016 PSU grant, which occurred during the first quarter of 2019.

At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $

5.8

million of unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs that will be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.6

years.  The estimated compensation expense is adjusted for actual performance experience and is recognized ratably during the service period, or remaining service period, if and when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied.  Compensation cost for PSUs subject to accelerated vesting at the date of retirement eligibility is recognized over the implicit service period.

The fair value of PSUs is estimated on the date of initial grant using the Monte-Carlo

Note 13 - Segment Information

We have

three

principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life.  Our other segments are Closed Block and Corporate.

The Unum US segment is comprised of group long-term and short-term disability insurance, which includes our medical stop-loss product as well as our fee-based leave management services and ASO business, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which are comprised of individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products.  These products are marketed through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants.

The Unum International segment is comprised of our operations in both the United Kingdom and Poland.  Our Unum UK products include insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business which include dental, individual disability, and critical illness products.  Our Unum Poland products include insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders.  Unum International's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants.

The Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers.

The Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care, individual disability, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed.  We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012.  Individual disability in this segment generally consists of policies we sold prior to the mid-1990s and entirely discontinued selling in 2004.  Other insurance products include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines.

The Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expenses not allocated to a line of business.

Acquisitions of Business

On November 1, 2018, we acquired


percent of the shares and voting interests in

Jaimini Health, Inc. (Jaimini Health)

, a dental health maintenance organization.  The acquisition of Jaimini Health will broaden our employee benefit dental offerings in the U.S., particularly in the state of California, and is reported in our Unum US segment.

On October 1, 2018, we acquired


percent of the shares and voting interests in

Unum Poland

, a financial protection benefits provider in Poland.  This acquisition will expand our European presence, which we believe to be an attractive market for financial protection benefits.

On January 1, 2018, we acquired


percent of the shares and voting interests in

Leavelogic, Inc (Leavelogic)

, a leave management technology provider.  The acquisition of Leavelogic will enhance our current leave management offerings by providing tools for employers and employees to better manage the family leave process and is reported in our Unum US segment.

Aggregate revenues for all three acquired entities totaled approximately $


million in 2017.  Aggregate assets were valued at approximately $


million as of the respective acquisition dates and were primarily comprised of bonds, short-term investments, and intangible assets attributable to the value of business acquired, the value of distribution networks, and licenses.  Aggregate liabilities were valued at approximately $


million as of the respective acquisition dates and were primarily comprised of outstanding claim liabilities, reserves for future claims, and income tax liabilities.  The aggregate purchase price for all three transactions was approximately $


million and exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets by approximately $


million, which was identified as goodwill, primarily attributable to the value of adding individual and group financial protection products in Poland to our current employee benefit offerings and the value of enhancing our technology capabilities around our leave management offerings.  The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes except upon disposition of the acquired entities.

Stockholders' equity is allocated to the operating segments on the basis of an internal allocation formula that reflects the volume and risk components of each operating segment's business and aligns allocated equity with our target capital levels for regulatory and rating agency purposes.  We modify this formula periodically to recognize changes in the views of capital requirements.

We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items specified in the reconciliations below.  We believe adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business.  These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income.

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments.  Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses.  Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals.  We exclude these items as we believe them to be infrequent or unusual in nature, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.

See Notes 6, 8, and 14 for further discussion regarding the impacts of the long-term care reserve increase, the cost related to early retirement of debt, the unclaimed death benefit reserve increase, and the loss from a guaranty fund assessment, respectively.

Note 14 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Contingent Liabilities

We are a defendant in a number of litigation matters that have arisen in the normal course of business.  Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.  Given the complexity and scope of our litigation and regulatory matters, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations or legal proceedings or provide reasonable estimates of potential losses, except if noted in connection with specific matters.

In some of these matters, no specified amount is sought.  In others, very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are asserted.  There is a wide variation of pleading practice permitted in the United States courts with respect to requests for monetary damages, including some courts in which no specified amount is required and others which allow the plaintiff to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that court.  Further, some jurisdictions permit plaintiffs to allege damages well in excess of reasonably possible verdicts.  Based on our extensive experience and that of others in the industry with respect to litigating or resolving claims through settlement over an extended period of time, we believe that the monetary damages asserted in a lawsuit or claim bear little relation to the merits of the case, or the likely disposition value.  Therefore, the specific monetary relief sought is not stated.

Unless indicated otherwise in the descriptions below, reserves have not been established for litigation and contingencies.  An estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Claims Handling Matters

We and our insurance subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of our business, are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits.  Most typically these lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder, and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims.  For our general claim litigation, we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course.  We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to general claim litigation, after consideration of the reserves maintained, will not be material to our consolidated financial condition.  Nevertheless, given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a period, depending on the results of operations for the particular period.

From time to time class action allegations are pursued where the claimant or policyholder purports to represent a larger number of individuals who are similarly situated.  Since each insurance claim is evaluated based on its own merits, there is rarely a single act or series of actions which can properly be addressed by a class action.  Nevertheless, we monitor these cases closely and defend ourselves appropriately where these allegations are made.

Miscellaneous Matters

Similar to other insurers, we were the subject of an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states.  We cooperated fully with this examination and in the fourth quarter of 2017, we started the process to reach a Global Resolution Agreement with the third party regarding settlement of the examination, which we finalized in January of 2018.  Under the terms of the agreement, the third party acting on behalf of the signatory states compared insured data to the Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify deceased insureds and contract holders where a valid claim has not been made.  During the fourth quarter of 2017, we established reserves which reflect our estimate of the liability expected to be paid as we execute on the terms of the settlement.  We also are cooperating with a Delaware Market Conduct examination involving the same issue, which is currently inactive.  The legal and regulatory environment around unclaimed death benefits continues to evolve.  It is possible that the current settlement and/or similar investigations by other state jurisdictions may result in payments to beneficiaries, the payment of abandoned funds under state law, and/or administrative penalties, the total of which may be in excess of the reserves established.

In 2009, a Pennsylvania-based insurance company and its affiliates were ordered into rehabilitation, and the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, who was appointed as the Rehabilitator, filed petitions for liquidation with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.  Under Pennsylvania law, payment of covered claims and other related insurance obligations are provided, within prescribed limits, by state guaranty associations.  These guaranty associations assess fees to meet these obligations on insurance companies that sell insurance within the state, which are generally based on a company's pro rata portion of average premiums written or received for several years prior to the insolvency.  In March 2017, a formal order of liquidation was issued, and as such, we were subject to an assessment by those guaranty associations that are responsible for policyholder claims, and accordingly accrued, in the first quarter of 2017, an estimated loss contingency.  We continue to submit payment to satisfy this assessment as requests for payment are received from the guaranty associations.

Securities Class Actions:

Three alleged securities class action lawsuits have been filed against Unum Group and individual defendants as follows:

•

On June 13, 2018, an alleged securities class action lawsuit entitled

Cynthia Pittman v. Unum Group, Richard McKenney, John McGarry, and Daniel Waxenberg

was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  The plaintiff seeks to represent purchasers of Unum Group publicly traded securities between January 31, 2018 and May 2, 2018.  The plaintiff alleges the Company caused its shares to trade at artificially high levels by failing to disclose information about the rate of long-term care policy terminations and long-term care claim incidence resulting in misleading statements about capital management plans and long-term care reserves.  The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.  The Company strongly denies these allegations and will vigorously defend the litigation.

•

On July 13, 2018, an alleged securities class action lawsuit entitled

Scott Cunningham v. Unum Group, Richard McKenney, John McGarry, and Daniel Waxenberg

was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  The allegations, class period, and damages claimed mirror those in the

Pittman

matter.  The Company strongly denies these allegations and will vigorously defend the litigation.

•

On July 25, 2018, an alleged securities class action lawsuit entitled

City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System v. Unum Group, Richard McKenney, John McGarry, Steve Zabel, and Daniel Waxenberg

was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  The plaintiff seeks to represent purchasers of Unum Group publicly traded securities between October 27, 2016 and May 1, 2018.  The allegations and damages claimed mirror those in the

Pittman

matter.  The Company strongly denies these allegations and will vigorously defend the litigation.

On November 9, 2018, the court consolidated the

Pittman

,

Cunningham

, and

City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System

cases into one matter entitled

In re Unum Group Securities Litigation

, appointed a lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff’s counsel, and directed the plaintiff to file a consolidated amended complaint.  On January 15, 2019, the plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint asserting claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial as well as costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees.  On March 18, 2019, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.  On November 4, 2019 the court heard oral argument on the motion.

We are awaiting the court’s ruling.

These lawsuits are in a very preliminary stage, the outcome is uncertain, and the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses.  Reserves have not been established for these matters.  Although we believe these claims lack merit, an adverse outcome in one or more of these actions could, depending on the nature, scope, and amount of the ruling, materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a period.

Note 16 - Statutory Financial Information

Statutory Net Income, Capital and Surplus, and Dividends

Statutory net income for U.S. life insurance companies is reported in conformity with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and adopted by applicable domiciliary state laws.  The commissioners of the states of domicile have the right to permit other specific practices that may deviate from prescribed practices.  Our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries have no prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices that differ materially from statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC.

Certain of our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to Northwind Re and Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries (captive reinsurers) domiciled in the United States, with Unum Group as the ultimate parent.  These captive reinsurers were established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our life insurance subsidiaries.

Fairwind, which is domiciled in the state of Vermont, is required to follow GAAP in accordance with Vermont reporting requirements for pure captive insurance companies, unless the commissioner permits the use of some other basis of accounting.  Fairwind has permission from Vermont to follow accounting practices that are generally consistent with current NAIC statutory accounting principles for its insurance reserves and invested assets supporting reserves.  All other assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with GAAP, as prescribed by Vermont, which includes the full recognition of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized.  Statutory accounting principles have a stricter limitation for the recognition of deferred tax assets.  The impact of following the prescribed and permitted practices of Vermont rather than statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC resulted in higher capital and surplus for Fairwind of approximately $


million and $


million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively.  Included in the 2018 results for Fairwind was the assumed portion of the statutory impact of the long-term care reserve increase from Unum America.  Included in the 2017 results for Fairwind was the revaluation of the deferred tax asset at the new corporate rate of 21 percent resulting from the enactment of TCJA.  Northwind Re has no material state prescribed accounting practices that differ from statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC.

The operating results and capital and surplus of our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries and our captive reinsurers, prepared in accordance with prescribed or permitted accounting practices of the NAIC or states of domicile, are presented separately below.

Note 16 - Statutory Financial Information - Continued

Solvency II, a European Union directive prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry.  As derived from the most recent annual financial statements based on Solvency II requirements, regulatory net income and own funds available of our United Kingdom insurance subsidiary, Unum Limited, were £

36.8

million and £

584.1

million, respectively.

Risk-based capital (RBC) standards for U.S. life insurance companies are prescribed by the NAIC.  The domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the RBC model formula of the NAIC, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers.  The basis of the system is a risk-based formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer's business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer.  The life and health RBC formula is designed to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks.  The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized.  State insurance laws grant insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels.  The total adjusted capital of each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 is in excess of those RBC levels.

Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities.  For life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S., that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer's statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year.  The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds.

Based on the restrictions under current law, approximately $

1,035

million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2020 for the payment of dividends to Unum Group from its traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries.  The ability of our captive insurers to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured.

We also have the ability to receive dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in the U.K., for which the payment may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance.  We have £

180.0

million available for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2020, subject to regulatory approval.

Deposits

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries had on deposit with U.S. regulatory authorities securities with a book value of $

135.2

million and $

155.7

million, respectively, held for the protection of policyholders.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report.  We evaluated those controls based on the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on that evaluation, these officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting encompasses the processes and procedures management has established to (i) maintain records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Company's transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; (iii) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are appropriately authorized; and (iv) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  In addition, any projection of the evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

Attestation Report of the Company's Registered Public Accounting Firm

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included herein, audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2019, and issued the attestation report included as follows.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Unum Group

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Unum Group and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  In our opinion, Unum Group and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 18, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

4.500

% senior notes due 2049.

The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

200.0

million

7.000

% senior unsecured notes matured.

Fair Value Hedges

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $

250.0

million notional amount of an interest rate swap which effectively converts certain of our unsecured senior notes into floating rate debt.  Under this agreement, we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest, based off of the three-month LIBOR.

Junior Subordinated Debt Securities

In May 2018, we issued $

300.0

million of

6.250

% junior subordinated notes due 2058.

The notes are redeemable at or above par on or after June 15, 2023 and rank equally in the right of payment with our other junior subordinated debt securities.

In 1998, Provident Financing Trust I (the Trust), a


percent-owned finance subsidiary of Unum Group, issued $

% capital securities due 2038 in a public offering.

These capital securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Unum Group, have a liquidation value of $

per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances.

In connection with the capital securities offering, Unum Group issued to the Trust

The Trust is a variable interest entity of which Unum Group is not the primary beneficiary.

Accordingly, the capital securities issued by the Trust are not included in the consolidated financial statements of Unum Group and subsidiaries and our liability represents the junior subordinated debt securities owed to the trust which is recorded in long-term debt.

The sole assets of the Trust are the junior subordinated debt securities.

The retirement of any liquidation amount regarding the capital securities by the Trust results in a corresponding retirement of principal amount of the junior subordinated debt securities.

During 2019, the Trust purchased and retired $

22.8

million aggregate liquidation amount of the 7.405% capital securities due 2038, which resulted in our purchase and retirement of a corresponding principal amount of our

Under the terms of the amended agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $700.0 million, up from the previous amount of $600.0 million.  We also may request, on up to two occasions, that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year.  The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations.  At December 31, 2019, letters of credit totaling $

0.6

million had been issued from the credit facility, but there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.

Also in April 2019, we separately entered into a three-year, $

100.0

million unsecured revolving credit facility with a different syndicate of lenders, which is set to expire in April 2022.  Under the terms of the agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $140.0 million.  We also may request that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year.  The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations.  At December 31, 2019, there have been

no

letters of credit issued from the credit facility and there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.

Borrowings under the credit facilities are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary.
