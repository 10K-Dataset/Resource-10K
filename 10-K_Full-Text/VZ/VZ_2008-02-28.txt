PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Verizon
Communications Inc. (Verizon) is one of the world’s leading providers of communications services. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as
Verizon Communications on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We completed our merger with MCI on January 6, 2006, and its operations are now part of our wireline business. Stressing diversity and commitment to the
communities in which we operate, we have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 235,000 employees.

Our principal executive offices are located at 140 West Street, New York, New York 10007 (telephone number 212-395-1000).

We have two primary reportable segments, Wireline and Domestic Wireless, which we operate and manage as strategic business
segments and organize by products and services. These segments and principal activities consist of the following:

Wireline

Wireline communications services include voice,
Internet access, broadband video and data, next generation Internet protocol (IP) network services, network access, long distance and other services. We provide these services to consumers, carriers, businesses and government customers both
domestically and internationally in 150 countries.

Domestic Wireless

Domestic Wireless’s products and services include wireless voice, data
products and other value-added services and equipment sales across the United States.

The following portions
of the 2007 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this Report:

•

“Overview” on pages 18 through 19;

•

“Segment Results of Operations” on pages 23 through 27 and in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 66 through 68; and,

•

“Discontinued Operations” and “Extraordinary Item” included in “Consolidated Results of Operations” on page 23.

Wireline

Background

Our Wireline segment comprises two strategic units, Verizon Telecom and
Verizon Business. In 2007, Wireline revenues were $50,316 million, representing approximately 54% of Verizon’s aggregate revenues. Our Wireline segment is not dependent on any single customer.

•

Verizon Telecom provides voice, video and data services to residential and small business customers in 28 states and Washington D.C. Verizon Telecom operates a
Fiber-to-the-Premises (FTTP) network under the FiOS service mark. This advanced fiber-optic network offers sufficient bandwidth for voice, data and video services and is designed to handle future broadband and video applications as they are
developed. FiOS allows us to offer our customers fast, reliable broadband access speeds and high definition video with exceptional clarity and vividness, as well as digital voice services.

•

Verizon Business provides voice, data, Internet communications, next-generation IP network and Information Technology (IT) products and services to medium and
large businesses and government customers both domestically and internationally.

In the discussion that follows, revenue amounts for each of the Wireline units exclude intrasegment eliminations of $2,846 million.

Operations

Verizon Telecom

Verizon Telecom offers a broad array of telecommunications services, including voice, video and data, network access, long-distance and other communications products and services to our
residential and small business customers. We have organized Verizon Telecom into three marketing units which operate across our telephone subsidiaries and focus on specific customer market areas.

Mass Markets

offers broadband and voice services to residential and
small business customers. Broadband services include High Speed Internet (DSL) and FiOS data and television services. Voice services include long distance services, including calling cards, 800/888 and operator services, as well as value-added
services, such as voicemail, call waiting and caller identification. In 2007, Mass Markets revenues were $21,978 million, representing approximately 44% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues. Mass Market revenues were derived primarily from
providing telecommunications services to residential users.

Wholesale

markets our long distance and local exchange network facilities for resale to interexchange carriers, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), wireless carriers and Internet Service Providers
(ISPs). Wholesale services include switched access products, high-capacity data products, unbundled network elements (UNEs) and interconnection services. In 2007, Wholesale



revenues were approximately $8,086 million, representing approximately 16.1% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues. Approximately 72% of Wholesale
revenues were derived from interexchange and wireless carriers. The remaining revenues principally came from CLECs, which resell network connection to their own customers.

Other

service offerings include operator services, public (coin) telephone, as well as dial around services including 10-10-987,
10-10-220, 1-800-COLLECT and prepaid phone cards. In 2007, revenues from these other services were $1,862 million, representing approximately 3.7% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues.

Verizon Business

Verizon Business offers medium and large business and government customers in the United States and around the world advanced voice, data, security, and
wireless solutions. Verizon Business derives 85% of its revenue from United States operations. Verizon Business provides services to over 70,000 enterprise businesses and government agencies, including 97% of the Fortune 500 companies. We have
organized Verizon Business into three marketing units that focus on specific customers.

Enterprise Business

offers voice, data and Internet communications services to medium and large business customers, including multi-national corporations and state and federal governments. Enterprise Business
also provides value-added services intended to make communications more secure, reliable and efficient. Enterprise Business provides managed network services for customers that outsource all or portions of their communications and information
processing operations and data services such as Private IP, Ethernet, Private Line, Frame Relay and ATM services, both domestically and internationally. Enterprise Business revenues in 2007 were $14,677 million, representing approximately 29% of
Wireline’s aggregate revenues.

Wholesale

markets
domestic and international voice, data and IP services over its global network to carriers and service providers, some of whom may compete directly with Verizon at the retail level. These customers purchase services on a
wholesale basis so that they can transport voice, data and IP traffic without having to build their own infrastructure. In 2007, total Wholesale revenue was $3,345 million, representing approximately 6.6% of Wireline’s aggregate
revenues.

Our

International and Other

operations serve
retail and wholesale customers, including enterprise businesses, government entities and telecommunications carriers outside of the United States, primarily in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Canada. These
operations provide telecommunications services, which include voice, data services, Internet and managed network services. Our revenues from International and Other were $3,214 million, representing 6.4% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues in
2007.

Competition

The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect
competition to further intensify with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking to capture a larger market share as boundaries between products continue to converge. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless
service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. Many of these companies have a
strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth.

We believe that cable operators represent the largest overall threat to our wireline business. Cable operators have
increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer more digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services.
Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic partnerships or alliances.

Wireless substitution has been an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue, as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing
competition from companies that provide Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. These services use the Internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications. VoIP services are available from a wide range of companies
including cable companies, national VoIP providers and regional service providers. Internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space, offering free or inexpensive voice calling from instant messaging clients, encouraging video bypass
by offering and enabling video content to PCs, selling content and applications such as gaming, music and business productivity tools and obtaining advertising revenues from web-based directory assistance and Internet search services.

As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires us to allow
potential competitors to purchase our services for resale, or access components of our network on an unbundled basis (UNEs) at a prescribed cost, competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase. Our telephone operations generally
have been required to sell their services to CLECs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. The scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive, are subject to ongoing review
and revision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state regulators. See “Regulatory and Competitive Trends” in the 2007 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners.



We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and consumer trends
in the wireline industry:

Network bandwidth (speed): As both
consumers and small business customers look to do more online and leverage high speed connections for entertainment, communications, and productivity, we expect broadband penetration will continue to increase over the next several years, although at
a slower rate due to market maturity. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, Verizon and other network-based providers must ensure that their networks can deliver
against these increasing bandwidth requirements. We are continuing to build out our FiOS network to be able to meet the future demands of our residential and business customers.

Pricing: Pricing will be a significant factor in two key areas. First, in the competition between cable and
telecommunications companies, pricing will be used to capture market share from incumbents. Second, pricing is significant as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and redefine existing categories. Portal-based and VoIP
calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. Customers will be increasingly exposed to these dramatically reduced prices and this will place increasing pressure on traditional communications services.

Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures,
providers will need to differentiate their products. Verizon believes that there are many market trends that provide potential opportunities. Customers are shifting from an access to an applications mindset and are focused on how they can leverage
their broadband and video connections. Personalization and increased mobility are critical, enabling customers to obtain products and services on demand. Converged feature sets, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming
similarly important, enabled by both customer demand and technological advancement.

Distribution channel reach: As products are becoming more experiential, customers are requiring a “hands-on” demonstration before they make a purchase commitment. One way for us to satisfy this customer need
is through the use of a retail store presence. Competitors are offering their products through both their own internal channels such as the Internet and call centers, and also by partnering with retailers to showcase products. Small business
customers require more and more hands-on consultation, and we are aligning our channel mix to address this need.

Network

As of December 31, 2007, our wireline network included more than 41 million wireline access lines, 8.2 million broadband connections and 943,000 FiOS TV customers nationwide. Our business strategy is to
be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in the mass market, while maintaining the level of network reliability currently provided by our telephony network. We are executing on this strategy by deploying FTTP access technologies
that replace copper loop facilities with fiber optic cables. FTTP provides the highest possible bandwidth to the customer premise, based on current technology. The FTTP deployment also allows us the flexibility to more easily adapt our facilities to
future product development. New optical terminals can be added to the FTTP network, providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction. To further differentiate our network, we began deploying Gigabit Passive
Optical Network (GPON) technology in 2007. GPON technology will continue to support the services we offer today, while allowing for the introduction of new services through improved downstream and upstream capacity.

In conjunction with the evolution of our access plant, we are also
transitioning our metro (local) network infrastructure from traditional TDM/SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)/ATM technologies to Ethernet over Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). In 2007 we began to deploy Reconfigurable Optic Add Drop
Multiplexer (ROADM) nodes in the transport network. As a result, the new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high speed data services, while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved
with SONET.

To fully leverage this new network infrastructure
and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services, we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use IP, Ethernet and MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) technologies. In addition, we are migrating from
traditional TDM-based voice switching to VoIP. This migration lowers the lifecycle cost of current data and voice services and creates a network which can offer future multi-media communications services by adding service platforms without requiring
widespread network upgrades. In keeping with our strategy of leading in network reliability, our service infrastructure utilizes our managed, Quality of Service-enabled resilient IP network rather than the Internet.

We advanced our goal of becoming a leading IP Services provider to the global
business market by acquiring one of the most expansive IP networks in the world through the MCI merger in 2006. In 2007, we focused on growing our Ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of Ethernet private line and E-LAN services locally,
domestically and globally. To lower the access cost and provide significant services flexibility, we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuit-based customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers
onto a shared Ethernet and MPLS network. We have also focused on the expansion of the Private IP network (PIP) to serve all key international markets with managed Quality of Service (QoS)-aware IP Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.
Verizon’s Public IP network is now interconnected to PIP through Security Gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to ‘off-net’ sites, such as employees’ homes, small
branch offices and mobile work forces. These enhancements extend our IP-services reach across the globe.

We continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies and expansion of our network to lower overall cost. We are integrating Ethernet, SONET and Optics, and Ultra Long Haul
technologies. In addition, we are deploying a new, next generation undersea cable technology though the Trans-Pacific Express (TPE) connecting the west coast of the United States to China, Korea and Taiwan.



Wireline Offerings

Verizon Telecom’s strategy is to be the customer’s first choice for communications and entertainment services. We offer a variety of packages
for these services that we believe are competitively priced.

Voice Services:

We offer packages that include local exchange services, regional and long distance services, VoIP services, wire maintenance, as well as voice messaging and value-added services. Value-added services expand the
utilization of our network and include products such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and Return Call. In 2007 we also began offering in most markets a new calling plan that bundles landline and wireless services, with calling features and unlimited
calling between a customer’s home phone and wireless handset, all on a single bill.

Data Services:

We offer high speed DSL and FiOS broadband data products with varying downstream and upstream processing speeds. In 2007 we introduced a new, symmetrical FiOS Internet service with download and
upload speeds of up to 20 Mbps. Our data packages include technical support, anti-virus and spam protection, and email online storage.

Video Services:

We offer FiOS TV, Verizon’s fiber-optic video service, and a variety of DIRECTV packages that are delivered over satellite

Domestic Wireless

Background

Our Domestic Wireless segment, primarily includes Cellco Partnership doing
business as Verizon Wireless (Verizon Wireless), which is a joint venture formed in April 2000 by the combination of the United States wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). Verizon owns a controlling 55%
interest in Verizon Wireless and Vodafone owns the remaining 45%.

Operations

Verizon Wireless provides wireless
voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States. Verizon Wireless is the largest domestic wireless carrier in terms of total revenue and the most profitable, as measured by operating income. We
believe, based on publicly available information, that Verizon Wireless has the largest base of retail customers, that is, customers who are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and who buy its branded services.

Competition

There is significant competition in the wireless telecommunications industry. Other wireless providers, including other
cellular and PCS operators and resellers, also serve each of the markets in which we operate. We currently compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers: AT&T (formerly Cingular), Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA. In
many markets we also compete with regional carriers, such as ALLTEL, US Cellular, Leap and MetroPCS. Competition may increase due to ongoing industry consolidation, if smaller, stand-alone wireless providers transfer licenses to larger, better
capitalized and more experienced wireless providers. Resellers, sometimes referred to as Mobile Virtual Network Operators, who buy bulk wholesale services from facilities-based carriers for resale, provide yet another set of differentiated
competitors in the marketplace.

We expect competition for both
customers and network usage to intensify for several reasons: the higher penetration levels that currently exist in the industry; the development and deployment of new technologies; the introduction of new wireless and fixed line products and
services; new market entrants; the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed; and regulatory changes. For example, we face increased competition from the use of other high-speed wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi and WiMAX,
which are being deployed to meet the growing customer appetite for wireless communications. In addition, some cable companies have partnered with wireless carriers, acquired wireless spectrum and introduced wireless offerings in some of their
markets. We are also experiencing competition from providers of fixed line VoIP services, which displace in-building usage from cellular/PCS carriers. Additionally, as wireless data use increases, content is becoming an increasingly significant
factor in the appeal of these services. This may give content providers and other participants in the wireless value chain opportunities for increased leverage and/or opportunities to compete for wireless data revenues.

We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in
our industry:

•

Network Reliability, Capacity and Coverage.

Lower prices, improved service quality and new service offerings have led to increased network usage. As a
result, the ability to keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through one’s own network is important. We have an extensive national network, and we continue to look for expansion opportunities through
the build-out of existing licenses, acquisitions and/or spectrum leasing. We own licenses that cover much of the country but we expect to continue making significant investments to expand our capacity, extend our coverage area and maintain and
improve the reliability of our network. Our major competitors also have these needs and they are addressing them in a similar manner.



•

Pricing

. Service and equipment pricing is an important area in which wireless carriers compete, as evidenced by recent increases in the marketing of
minutes-sharing plans, free mobile-to-mobile calling, as well as offerings of larger bundles of included minutes at price points with no roaming or long distance charges. We seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and
equipment that they will regard as the best value for the cost.

•

Customer Service

. Continued high quality customer service is essential to attract new customers and retain existing customers. We believe that the quality
of our customer service is a key factor in retaining our customers and in attracting both new-to-wireless customers and customers of other carriers who want to switch their wireless service. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer
service and are also focusing on improving the customer experience.

•

Product Differentiation

. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks expand, continued customer and revenue growth will be
increasingly dependent on the development of new and differentiated products and services. We are committed to providing customer solutions through the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative products and services developed both
internally and in collaboration with application service providers. In order to expand the availability of a wide range of devices for customers, by the end of 2008 customers will have the option to use wireless devices on our nationwide wireless
network that are not provided by Verizon Wireless but otherwise meet Verizon Wireless technical standards.

•

Sales and Distribution

. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We
believe that the optimal mix of direct, indirect and wholesale distribution channels is an important ingredient in achieving industry-leading profitability. A goal of our distribution strategy is to increase sales through our company-operated stores
and our outside sales team, as well as through telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities. Supplementing this is an extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, original equipment
manufacturers and value-added distributors, as well as various resellers who buy our service on a wholesale basis.

Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the industry, including the factors described above, as well
as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions, and pricing strategies of competitors.

Network

A key part of our business strategy is to provide the highest network reliability, which we believe is a key differentiator in the United States market
and a driver of customer satisfaction. We will continue to expand and upgrade our network to provide sufficient capacity and superior coverage throughout our licensed area so that our customers can enjoy high-quality, reliable service. In addition,
we will continue to explore strategic opportunities to expand our overall national coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. Also, as part of our initiative to provide customers with the option of using
wireless devices not provided by Verizon Wireless on our nationwide wireless network (see “Domestic Wireless – Competition – Product Differentiation”), in early 2008, we will publish the technical interface standards that the
development community will need in order to design such devices.

Our network is among the most extensive in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in 49 of the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Our existing network covered a population of approximately 263 million and provided
service to 65.7 million customers as of December 31, 2007.

Network Technology

Our primary network
technology platform is CDMA, based on spread-spectrum digital radio technology. 1XRTT technology is deployed in virtually all of our cell sites nationwide. In 2004, we began deploying EV-DO (Revision 0), a 3G packet-based technology intended
primarily for high-speed data transmission. In 2007, we expanded our EV-DO footprint, covering a population of approximately 242 million as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we deployed EV-DO (Revision A) throughout this footprint, which
allows for even faster data speeds than Revision 0.

We plan to
develop and deploy our fourth generation mobile broadband network using long term evolution (LTE) technology developed within the Third Generation Partnership Project standards organization. We believe that LTE will provide us with a unique
opportunity to adopt an access platform with global scale and compatibility with other technologies. The technology is designed to deliver mobile data networks with higher speed and throughput performance, lower latency, improved efficiencies and
global roaming.

Spectrum

We have licenses to provide mobile wireless services on the 800-900 MHz, the
1800 -1900 MHz and on the 1700 and 2100 MHz portions of the radio spectrum. Collectively, these licenses cover territories in which approximately 295 million people, or approximately 99% of the estimated United States population, reside. The
800-900 MHz portion is used to provide digital cellular voice and data services and it was also used to provide analog service in our cellular markets. However, as of February 18, 2008, the FCC no longer requires cellular carriers to provide
analog service. We are currently shutting down our analog service and expect the shutdown to be complete in virtually all of our markets by the end of the first quarter of 2008. We use the 1800-1900 MHz portion of the spectrum to provide digital PCS
voice and data services, and we intend to use the 1700 and 2100 MHz portions to deploy advanced wireless broadband services.

We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand and that we can meet such needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from
other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC. The FCC began conducting an auction of



spectrum in the 700 MHz band on January 24, 2008. This spectrum is currently used for UHF television operations but by law those operations must cease
no later than February 17, 2009. We filed an application on December 3, 2007, to qualify as a bidder in this auction, and on January 14, 2008, the FCC announced that we and 213 other applicants had qualified as eligible to bid in the
auction. The FCC determined that bidding in this auction will be “anonymous,” which means that prior to and during the course of the

auction(s), the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant’s upfront deposit or its bids. In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in the auction.

Wireless Offerings

We believe that increasing the value of our service offerings to customers
will help us to retain our existing customers, attract new customers and increase customer usage, all of which will, in turn, drive revenue and net income growth.

Our service packages are designed around key customer groups, from the young adult market to multinational business
accounts. We tailor our wireless services, which include both voice and data offerings, and postpaid and prepaid pricing options, to the needs of these customers.

Wireless Services

Voice services.

We offer a variety of packages for voice services with features and competitive pricing plans that are predominantly offered on a
postpaid basis with a contract term. Specifically, we offer our Nationwide Calling Plans, which provide a choice in amounts of bundled minutes together with no roaming or long distance charges for calls on our preferred network; family/small group
and shared minute plans for multiple-user households and small businesses; and plans targeted to business accounts with over 100 lines and national accounts with over 1,000 lines. In addition, we offer a national prepaid product that enables
individuals to obtain wireless voice services without a long-term contract by paying in advance.

Data services.

We believe that we are in a strong position to take advantage of the growing demand for wireless data services. Our strategy is to continue to expand our wireless data,
messaging and multi-media offerings for both consumer and business customers.

We offer an array of data transmission and content services, such as:

•

NationalAccess/BroadbandAccess

. We offer our NationalAccess service, which enables applications such as e-mail, enterprise applications, image downloads
and full browsing capabilities for laptop computer users. In addition, in areas where our network provides EV-DO coverage, we offer our BroadbandAccess service, which provides faster speeds on those applications and enables the provisioning of
enhanced data applications that can operate at broadband speeds.

•

Text and Picture Messaging

. With compatible wireless devices, our customers can send and receive text messages, as well as still pictures and full-motion
video clips with sound.

•

V CAST

. Our

V CAST

Video service enables customers to access daily-updated videos from leading content providers of news, weather, sports and
entertainment programming in areas covered by our EV-DO network. Our

V CAST

Music service enables customers to download music either directly to their

V CAST

Music-enabled handsets or to their personal computers. In addition, our

suite of services offers our wireless business customers, through the use of their existing wireless devices,
calling features traditionally associated with landline/PBX phones, such as abbreviated dialing.



Global Services

We offer a host of global solutions, available on certain of the wireless devices we offer, including GlobalAccess and GlobalEmail. This suite of
solutions gives customers voice service in more than 185 destinations worldwide and data access in more than 100 destinations worldwide.

Wireless Devices

We are a service provider of choice for wireless device manufacturers which helps us develop exclusive offers for our customers, as well as branded wireless devices that complement our focus on a
high-quality customer experience. The wireless devices that we offer are predominantly EV-DO enabled, and all of them are compatible with our 1XRTT network. In addition, all of the handsets that we offer are headphone/earphone compatible and,
compliant with the FCC’s E-911 requirements, through their GPS functionality.

Marketing

We focus our marketing strategy on
targeting solutions based on satisfying our customers’ needs, promoting our brand, leveraging our extensive distribution network and cross-marketing with Verizon’s other business units and Vodafone.

We focus our marketing efforts on a coordinated program of television, print,
radio, outdoor signage and Internet and point-of-sale media promotions. Coordinated marketing efforts throughout our service area ensure that our marketing message is consistently presented across all of our markets. Promoting the “Verizon
Wireless” brand is complemented by Verizon’s other brand marketing efforts, reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of Verizon Communications’ customer base.

Sales and Distribution Channels

Our sales strategy uses a mix of direct, indirect and wholesale distribution
channels to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs.

Our company-operated stores are an important component of our distribution strategy. Our experience has been that customers entering through this direct channel are generally higher-value customers who generate higher
revenue per month on average and are less likely to cancel their service than those who come through other mass-market channels. We had approximately 2,400 company-operated stores and kiosks (including our “store-within-a-store” kiosks in
Circuit City and BJ’s Wholesale locations) as of December 31, 2007. In addition, our direct channel also includes our business-to-business organization, which is focused on supporting the needs of our local, regional and national business
customers, as well as a telemarketing sales force dedicated to receiving incoming calls. We also offer fully-automated, end-to-end, web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service in all of our markets.

We have indirect retail locations throughout the United States selling
wireless services, including both full-service locations and locations selling our prepaid products and services, such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target. We also sell wireless access on a wholesale basis, which involves the sale of wholesale access
and minutes to independent companies that package and resell wireless services to end-users.

Customer Service, Retention and Satisfaction

We believe that quality customer service increases customer satisfaction, which reduces churn, and is a key differentiator in the wireless industry. We are committed to providing high-quality customer service,
investing in loyalty and retention efforts and continually monitoring customer satisfaction in all facets of our service.

While our customer service representatives are available during our normal business hours, we also have representatives available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week for emergency and technical customer issues. In addition, customers can do business with us at any time, without having to speak with a customer service representative, through our enhanced self-service applications via our interactive voice
response system, through our web site, and via applications accessible from the customer’s handset.

Under our enhanced Worry Free Guarantee, a national retention and loyalty initiative, we commit to provide our customers an extensive and advanced network: responsive customer service with
end-to-end resolution; the option to change at any time to any qualifying price plan without payment of any additional fees or requiring any contract extension; a satisfaction guarantee with our “Test Drive” program; an early termination
fee that declines each full month that a customer remains on their contract; and a handset upgrade credit every two years, provided that the customer signs a new two-year contract on a calling plan with at least $35 monthly access. In addition, our
“My Account Advantage” program offers customers who register with our “My Account” website free back-up protection that stores a copy of the customer’s phone contact list on a secure website, an annual handset upgrade option
for qualified customers and periodic notification if the customer exceeds their plan allowance. Another major retention and loyalty program is a customer life cycle management program in which we contact customers at key points in their service
tenure with targeted offers and to provide proactive rate-plan analysis.

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

In this Annual Report
on Form 10-K we have made forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed
future results of operations. Forward-looking statements also include those preceded or followed by the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “hopes” or similar expressions. For those statements, we
claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The following important factors, along with those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, could affect future results and could cause those results to
differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:

•

materially adverse changes in economic and industry conditions and labor matters, including workforce levels and labor negotiations, and any resulting financial
and/or operational impact, in the markets served by us or by companies in which we have substantial investments;

•

material changes in available technology, including disruption of our suppliers’ provisioning of critical products or services;

•

the impact on our operations of natural or man-made disasters and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance;

•

technology substitution;

•

an adverse change in the ratings afforded our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations;

•

the final results of federal and state regulatory proceedings concerning our provision of retail and wholesale services and judicial review of those results;

•

the effects of competition in our markets;

•

the timing, scope and financial impact of our deployment of fiber-to-the-premises broadband technology;

•

the ability of Verizon Wireless to continue to obtain sufficient spectrum resources;

•

changes in our accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their
application, which could result in an impact on earnings;

•

the ability to complete acquisitions and dispositions; and

•

the extent and timing of our ability to obtain revenue enhancements and cost savings following our business combination with MCI, Inc.



Item 1A.    Risk Factors

We face
significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits.

We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional lines between local, long distance, wireless, cable and Internet
communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, electric utilities, and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have
enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to
various competitive factors, including new services that may be introduced by our competitors, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends and pricing pressures. We are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of
our competitors, due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business. Accordingly, our competitors may be able to offer services at lower prices. The resulting pressure on the price of
services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits. In addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the
potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs.

If we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy.

Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies
are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to
address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. In general, the development of new services in
our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could
be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. If these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase,
our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected.

While we believe our primary wireless technology platform, CDMA, and its upgrades offer many advantages, many competing wireless service providers have chosen GSM or other technologies as the technology platforms for
their wireless networks. In addition, in November 2007, we announced that we intend to develop and deploy our “fourth generation” mobile broadband network using “Long Term Evolution” (LTE). This new technology is designed to
enable mobile data networks with higher speeds and improved efficiencies. However, there are risks that current or future versions of the wireless technologies and evolutionary path that we have selected may not be demanded by existing and
prospective customers or provide the advantages that we expect. In addition, there are risks that other wireless carriers on whom our customers roam may change their technology to other technologies that are incompatible with ours. As a result, the
ability of our and such other carriers’ customers to roam on our respective wireless networks could be adversely affected. If these risks materialize, our ability to provide national wireless service to our customers, to retain and attract
customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected.

We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.

We also depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business. If these suppliers or
vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to implement our business strategy and, in addition, we might be unable to satisfy the requirements contained in our FCC licenses
regarding the construction of our wireless network. These suppliers and vendors may be subject to litigation with respect to technology that we depend on for our service offerings.

Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of
operations.

Our operations are subject to regulation by
the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services, or the reviews by federal
or state courts of regulatory rulings. Unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. In addition, the adoption of new laws or
regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could adversely affect our business plans. For example, the development of new technologies, such as Internet Protocol-based services, including VoIP and super high-speed broadband and
video, could be subject to conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. In addition, the rapid
growth of the wireless industry has led to an increase in efforts by some state legislatures and state public utility commissions to regulate the industry in ways that may impose additional costs on Verizon Wireless. Moreover, many states have also
imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry.



Natural or man-made disasters may disrupt our operations.

The occurrence of natural or man-made
disasters may disrupt our operations. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our inability
to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers, which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to a
significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.

Our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating
to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and
class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay
significant awards or settlements.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

General

Our principal
properties do not lend themselves to simple description by character and location. Our total investment in plant, property and equipment was approximately $214 billion at December 31, 2007 and $204 billion at December 31, 2006, including
the effect of retirements, but before deducting accumulated depreciation. Our gross investment in plant, property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:



Network equipment

%

100.0%

Our properties are
divided among our operating segments at December 31, as follows:

Network equipment
consists primarily of cable (predominantly aerial, buried underground or undersea) and the related support structures of poles and conduit, wireless plant, switching equipment, transmission equipment and related facilities. Land, buildings and
building equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings owned by Verizon that are used for administrative and other purposes. Furniture and other consists
of public telephone instruments and telephone equipment (including PBXs), furniture, office equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction, capital leases, capitalized computer software costs and leasehold improvements. A portion of our
property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages securing funded debt.

The customers of our telephone operations are served by electronic switch systems (analog/digital/packet) that provide a wide variety of services. As of December 31, 2007, virtually all of the switched
access lines were served by digital capability.

Capital Expenditures

We continue to make
significant capital expenditures to meet the demand for communications services and to further improve such services. Capital spending for Wireline was $10,956 million in 2007, $10,259 million in 2006 and $8,267 million in 2005. Capital spending for
Domestic Wireless was $6,503 million in 2007, $6,618 million in 2006 and $6,484 million in 2005.



Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Verizon, and a number
of other telecommunications companies, have been the subject of multiple class action suits concerning its alleged participation in intelligence-gathering activities allegedly carried out by the federal government, at the direction of the President
of the United States, as part of the government’s post-September 11 program to prevent terrorist attacks. Plaintiffs generally allege that Verizon has participated by permitting the government to gain access to the content of its
subscribers’ telephone calls and/or records concerning those calls and that such action violates federal and/or state constitutional and statutory law. Relief sought in the cases includes injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, and statutory
and punitive damages. On August 9, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“Panel”) ordered that these actions be transferred, consolidated and coordinated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California. The Panel subsequently ordered that a number of “tag along” actions also be transferred to the Northern District of California. Verizon believes that these lawsuits are without merit and has moved to dismiss them.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has advised
Verizon New York Inc. (VZNY) of potential issues in connection with its underground storage tank registration, inspection and maintenance program. While VZNY does not believe that any of the alleged conditions has resulted in a release or threatened
release, aggregate penalties relating to alleged violations could exceed $100,000 because of the number of tanks operated by VZNY. VZNY does not believe that the cost of remedying any alleged violations will be material.

Verizon Wireless is conducting an audit of its cell site, switch and
non-retail building facilities under an audit agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The audit while not complete, identified potential violations of various laws governing hazardous substance reporting, air permitting and
spill plan preparation. Although none of the potential violations has resulted in a release or threatened release, aggregate penalties relating to alleged violations could exceed $100,000 because of the number of facilities operated by Verizon
Wireless. Verizon Wireless does not believe that the penalties ultimately incurred and the cost of remedying any alleged violations will be material.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

Not Applicable.

Executive Officers of the Registrant

Set
forth below is information with respect to our executive officers.

Prior to serving as an
executive officer, each of the above officers has held high level managerial positions with the company or one of its subsidiaries for at least five years.

PART II

Item 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
of Equity Securities

The principal market
for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange. The common stock is also listed in the United States on the Chicago and Philadelphia stock exchanges. As of December 31, 2007, there were 836,237 shareowners of record.

High and low stock prices, as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange composite tape of transactions, and dividend data are as follows:

* 2006 prices have
been adjusted for the spin-off of our domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories business.

The following table provides information about Verizon’s common stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2007.

On January 19,
2006, the Board of Directors approved a share buy back program which authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million common shares by no later than the close of business on February 28, 2008. On March 1, 2007, the Board of Directors
replaced this share buy back program with a new program for the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of Verizon common stock through the earlier of February 28, 2010 or when the total number of shares repurchased under the new buy back
program aggregates to 100 million. On February 7, 2008, the Board of Directors replaced this share buy back program with a new program for the repurchase of up to 100 million common shares terminating no later than the close of business on
February 28, 2011. The Board also determined that no additional shares were to be purchased under the prior program. The current program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on
market conditions and corporate needs. The Board also authorized Verizon to enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time to facilitate the repurchase of its shares. A Rule 10b5-1 plan permits the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might
otherwise be prevented from doing so, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information.
