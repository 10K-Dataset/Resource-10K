Competitive
    Strengths

We benefit from a number of competitive strengths, including the
    following:

• Leading
    Positions

We believe that we are a leading global integrated producer of
    acetyl, acetate and vinyl emulsion products. Advanced Engineered
    Materials and our strategic affiliates, Polyplastics Co., Ltd.
    (“Polyplastics”) and Korea Engineering Plastics Co.,
    Ltd. (“KEPCO”), are leading producers and suppliers of
    engineered polymers in North America, Europe and the
    Asia-Pacific region. Our leadership positions are based on our
    large share of global production capacity, operating
    efficiencies, proprietary production technology and competitive
    cost structures in our major product lines.



• Proprietary
    Production Technology and Operating Expertise

Our production of acetyl products employs industry-leading
    proprietary and licensed technologies, including our proprietary
    AOPlus

®


    and
    AOPlus

tm

technologies for the production of acetic acid and
    VAntage

tm

and VAntage
    Plus

tm

vinyl acetate monomer technology.
    AOPlus

®


    builds on the industry benchmark with the ability to increase
    acetic acid production from our current capacity of
    1.2 million tons per reactor per year to approximately
    1.5 million tons per reactor per year at a fraction of the
    cost of a new facility. This technology is applicable to
    existing and new greenfield units.
    AOPlus

tm

enables increased raw material efficiencies, lower operating
    costs and the ability to expand plant capacity with minimal
    investment.
    VAntage

tm

and VAntage
    Plus

tm

enable significant increases in production efficiencies, lower
    operating costs and increases in capacity at ten to fifteen
    percent of the cost of building a new plant.

• Low
    Cost Producer

Our competitive cost structures are based on production and
    purchasing economies of scale, vertical integration, technical
    expertise and the use of advanced technologies.

• Global
    Reach

We own or lease thirty-two production facilities throughout the
    world, of which five sites are no longer operating as of
    December 31, 2009. We participate in strategic ventures
    which operate thirteen additional facilities. Our infrastructure
    of manufacturing plants, terminals, warehouses and sales offices
    provides us with a competitive advantage in anticipating and
    meeting the needs of our global and local customers in
    well-established and growing markets, while our geographic
    diversity reduces the potential impact of volatility in any
    individual country or region. We have a strong, growing presence
    in Asia, particularly in China, and we have a defined strategy
    to continue this growth. For more information regarding our
    financial information with respect to our geographic areas, see
    Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.

• Strategic
    Investments

Our strategic investments have enabled us to gain access,
    minimize costs and accelerate growth in new markets, while also
    generating significant cash flow and earnings. Our equity
    investments and cost investments represent an important
    component of our growth strategy. See Note 8 to the
    consolidated financial statements and

Item 1.
    Business — Investments

for additional information
    on our equity and cost investments.

• Diversified
    Products and End-Use Markets

We offer our customers a broad range of products in a wide
    variety of end-use markets. Our diversified end-use markets
    include paints and coatings, textiles, automotive applications,
    consumer and medical applications, performance industrial
    applications, filter media, paper and packaging, chemical
    additives, construction, consumer and industrial adhesives, and
    food and beverage applications. This product and market
    diversity reduces the potential impact of volatility in any
    individual segment.

Business
    Strategies

Our strategic foundation is based on the following four pillars
    which are focused on increasing operating cash flows, improving
    profitability, delivering high return on investments and
    increasing shareholder value:

• Focus

We focus on businesses where we have a sustainable and proven
    competitive advantage. We continue to optimize our business
    portfolio in order to achieve market, cost and technology
    leadership while expanding our product mix into higher
    value-added products.



• Investment

We build on advantaged positions that optimize our portfolio of
    products. In order to improve our competitive advantage, we have
    invested in: our core group of businesses through acquisitions;
    growth in Asia bolstered by our integrated chemical complex in
    Nanjing, China; and new applications of our advanced engineered
    polymers products.

• Growth

We aggressively align with our customers and their end-use
    markets to capture growth. We are quickly expanding in Asia, the
    fastest-growing region in the world, in order to meet increasing
    demand for our products. As part of our strategy, we also
    continue to develop new products and industry-leading production
    technologies that deliver value-added solutions for our
    customers.

• Redeployment

We divest non-core assets and revitalize underperforming
    businesses. We have divested or exited businesses where we no
    longer maintain a competitive advantage. We also continue to
    make key strategic decisions to revitalize businesses that have
    significant potential for improved performance and enhanced
    efficiency.

Underlying all of these strategies is a culture of execution and
    productivity. We continually seek ways to reduce costs, increase
    productivity and improve process technology. Our commitment to
    operational excellence is an integral part of our strategy to
    maintain our cost advantage and productivity leadership.

Business
    Segments

Advanced
    Engineered Materials

Our Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical
    polymers for application in automotive and electronics products,
    as well as other consumer and industrial applications. Together
    with our strategic affiliates, we are a leading participant in
    the global technical polymers industry. The primary products of
    Advanced Engineered Materials are POM, PPS, LFRT, PBT, PET,
    GUR

®

and LCP. POM, PPS, LFRT, PBT and PET are used in a broad range
    of products including automotive components, electronics,
    appliances and industrial applications.
    GUR

®

is used in battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration
    equipment, coatings and medical devices. Primary end markets for
    LCP are electrical and electronics.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ technical polymers have
    chemical and physical properties enabling them, among other
    things, to withstand extreme temperatures, resist chemical
    reactions with solvents and withstand fracturing or stretching.
    These products are used in a wide range of performance-demanding
    applications in the automotive and electronics sectors as well
    as in other consumer and industrial goods.

Advanced Engineered Materials works in concert with its
    customers to enable innovations and develop new or enhanced
    products. Advanced Engineered Materials focuses its efforts on
    developing new markets and applications for its product lines,
    often developing custom formulations to satisfy the technical
    and processing requirements of a customer’s applications.
    For example, Advanced Engineered Materials has collaborated with
    fuel system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with the
    chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure
    to hot diesel fuels in the new generation of common rail diesel
    engines. The product can also be used in automotive fuel sender
    units where it remains stable at the high operating temperatures
    present in direct-injection diesel engines and can meet the
    requirements of the new generation of bio fuels.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ customer base consists
    primarily of a large number of plastic molders and component
    suppliers, which typically supply original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”). Advanced Engineered Materials
    works with these molders and component suppliers as well as
    directly with the OEMs to develop and improve specialized
    applications and systems.

Prices for most of these products, particularly specialized
    product grades for targeted applications, generally reflect the
    value added in complex polymer chemistry, precision formulation
    and compounding, and the extensive



application development services provided. These specialized
    products are not typically susceptible to cyclical swings in
    pricing.

• Key

Advanced Engineered Materials’ sales in Asia are made
    directly and through distributors including its strategic
    affiliates. Polyplastics, KEPCO and Fortron are accounted for
    under the equity method and therefore not included in Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ consolidated net sales. If Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ portion of the sales made by these
    strategic affiliates were included in the table above, the
    percentage of sales sold in Asia-Pacific would be substantially
    higher. A number of Advanced Engineered Materials’ POM
    customers, particularly in the appliance, electrical components
    and certain sections of the electronics/telecommunications
    fields, have moved tooling and molding operations to Asia,
    particularly southern China. In addition to our Advanced
    Engineered Materials affiliates, we directly service Asian
    demand by offering our customers global solutions.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ principal customers are
    consumer product manufacturers and suppliers to the automotive
    industry. These customers primarily produce engineered products,
    and Advanced Engineered Materials collaborates with its
    customers to assist in developing and improving specialized
    applications and systems. Advanced Engineered Materials has
    long-standing relationships with most of its major customers,
    but also uses distributors for its major products, as well as a
    number of electronic marketplaces to reach a larger customer
    base. For most of Advanced Engineered Materials’ products,
    contracts with customers typically have a term of one to two
    years.

• Competition

Advanced Engineered Materials’ principal competitors
    include BASF AG (“BASF”), E. I. DuPont de Nemours and

Consumer
    Specialties

The Consumer Specialties segment consists of our Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. Our Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow, which is used in
    the production of filter products. We also produce acetate flake
    which is processed into acetate fiber in the form of a tow band.
    Our Nutrinova business produces and sells
    Sunett

®

,

    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical
    industries.

• Key
    Products

Acetate tow is used primarily in cigarette filters. We produce
    acetate flake by processing wood pulp with acetic anhydride. We
    purchase wood pulp that is made from reforested trees from major
    suppliers and produce acetic anhydride internally. The acetate
    flake is then further processed into acetate fiber in the form
    of a tow band.



According to the 2009 Stanford Research Institute International
    Chemical Economics Handbook, as of 2008 we are the world’s
    leading producer of acetate tow, including production of our
    China ventures.

Sales of acetate tow amounted to approximately 16%, 12% and 11%
    of our consolidated net sales for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We have an approximate 30% interest in three manufacturing China
    ventures, which are accounted for as cost method investments
    (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) that
    produce acetate flake and tow. Our partner in each of the
    ventures is the Chinese state-owned tobacco entity, China
    National Tobacco Corporation. In addition, approximately 12% of
    our 2009 acetate tow sales were sold directly to China, the
    largest consuming country for acetate tow.

Acesulfame potassium, a high intensity sweetener marketed under
    the trademark
    Sunett

,

    is used in a variety of beverages, confections and dairy
    products throughout the world.
    Sunett

®

pricing for targeted applications reflects the value added by
    Nutrinova, through consistent product quality and reliable
    supply. Nutrinova’s strategy is to be the most reliable and
    highest quality producer of this product, to develop new product
    applications and expand into new markets.

Nutrinova’s food ingredients business consists of the
    production and sale of food protection ingredients, such as
    sorbic acid and sorbates, and high intensity sweeteners
    worldwide. Nutrinova’s food protection ingredients are
    mainly used in foods, beverages and personal care products. The
    primary raw materials for these products are ketene and
    crotonaldehyde. Sorbates pricing is extremely sensitive to
    demand and industry capacity and is not necessarily dependent on
    the prices of raw materials.

•  Facilities

Acetate Products has production sites in the United States,
    Mexico, the United Kingdom and Belgium, and participates in
    three manufacturing ventures in China.

Nutrinova has a production facility in Germany, as well as sales

    used in the production of cellulose acetate, detergents and
    pharmaceuticals. Acetaldehyde is a major feedstock for the
    production of a variety of derivatives, such as pyridines, which
    are used in agricultural products. We manufacture acetic acid,
    VAM and acetic anhydride for our own use, as well as for sale to
    third parties.

Acetic acid and VAM, our basic acetyl intermediates products,
    are impacted by global supply and demand fundamentals and are
    cyclical in nature. The principal raw materials in these
    products are ethylene, which we purchase from numerous sources;
    carbon monoxide, which we purchase under long-term contracts;
    and methanol, which we purchase under long-term and short-term
    contracts. With the exception of carbon monoxide, these raw
    materials are commodity products available from a wide variety
    of sources.

    that is a solvent used in coatings, inks and adhesives and in
    the manufacture of photographic films and coated papers; and

•    Butyl acetate, an acetate ester
    that is a solvent used in inks, pharmaceuticals and perfume.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde derivative products are
    derivatives of methanol and are made up of the following
    products:

•    Formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde and
    formcels are primarily used to produce adhesive resins for
    plywood, particle board, coatings, POM engineering resins and a
    compound used in making polyurethane;

•    Amines such as methyl amines,
    monisopropynol amines and butyl amines are used in
    agrochemicals, herbicides and the treatment of rubber and
    water; and

•    Special solvents, such as
    crotonaldehyde, which are used by the Nutrinova line for the
    production of sorbates, as well as raw materials for the
    fragrance and food ingredients industry.

Solvents and derivatives are commodity products characterized by
    cyclicality in pricing. The principal raw materials used in
    solvents and derivatives products are acetic acid, various
    alcohols, methanol, ethylene and ammonia. We manufacture many of
    these raw materials for our own use as well as for sales to
    third parties, including our competitors in the solvents and
    derivatives business. We purchase ethylene from a variety of
    sources. We manufacture acetaldehyde in Europe for our own use,
    as well as for sale to third parties.

    including financing and administrative activities such as legal,
    accounting and treasury functions, interest income and expense
    associated with our financing activities, and our captive
    insurance companies. Our two wholly-owned captive insurance
    companies are a key component of our global risk management
    program, as well as a form of self-insurance for our property,
    liability and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance
    companies issue insurance policies to our subsidiaries to
    provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the
    insurance market and to lower long-term insurance costs by
    avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory
    fees. The captive insurance companies retain risk at levels
    approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from
    third parties to limit the net risk retained. One of the captive
    insurance companies also insures certain third-party risks.



Investments

We have a significant portfolio of strategic investments,
    including a number of ventures in Asia-Pacific, North America
    and Europe. In aggregate, these strategic investments enjoy
    significant sales, earnings and cash flow. We have entered into

• Major
    Equity Method Investments

Korea Engineering Plastics Co. Ltd.

Founded in 1987,
    KEPCO is the leading producer of polyacetal in South Korea.
    Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. owns 40% and Mitsubishi
    Corporation owns 10% of KEPCO. KEPCO operates a POM plant in
    Ulsan, South Korea and participates with Polyplastics and
    Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM
    facility in Nantong, China.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd.

We believe Polyplastics is a
    leading supplier of engineered plastics in the Asia-Pacific
    region. Polyplastics’ principal production facilities are
    located in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and China. We believe
    Polyplastics is a leading producer and marketer of POM in the
    Asia-Pacific region.

Fortron Industries LLC.

We believe Fortron
    Industries LLC (“Fortron”) is a leading global
    producer of PPS. Fortron’s facility is located in
    Wilmington, North Carolina. We believe Fortron has the leading
    technology in linear polymer applications.

• Major
    Cost Method Investments

National Methanol Co. (“Ibn Sina”).

With
    production facilities in Saudi Arabia, Ibn Sina represents
    approximately 2% of the world’s methanol production
    capacity and is the world’s eighth largest producer of
    MTBE. Methanol and MTBE are key global commodity chemical
    products. We indirectly own a 25% interest in Ibn Sina through
    CTE Petrochemicals Co., a joint venture with Texas Eastern
    Arabian Corporation Ltd. (which also indirectly owns 25%), with
    the remainder held by SABIC (50%). SABIC has responsibility for
    all product marketing.

China Acetate Products ventures.

We hold
    approximately 30% ownership interests (50% board representation)
    in three separate Acetate Products production entities in China:
    the Nantong, Kunming and Zhuhai Cellulose Fiber Companies. In
    each instance, the Chinese state-owned tobacco entity, China
    National Tobacco Corporation, controls the remainder. The China
    ventures fund operations using operating cash flows.



These cost investments where we own greater than a 20% ownership
    interest are accounted for under the cost method of accounting
    because we cannot exercise significant influence over these
    entities. We determined that we cannot exercise significant
    influence over these entities due to local government investment
    in and influence over these entities, limitations on our
    involvement in the

day-to-day

operations and the present inability of the entities to provide
    timely financial information prepared in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
    (“US GAAP”).

• Other
    Equity Investments

InfraServs.

We hold ownership interests in several
    InfraServ entities located in Germany. InfraServs own and
    develop industrial parks and provide

on-site

general and administrative support to tenants. The table below

Raw
    Materials and Energy

We purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources
    in many countries for use in our production processes. We have a
    policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of
    supply for materials. However, some of our individual plants may
    have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials,
    such as carbon monoxide, steam and acetaldehyde. Although we
    have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials,
    there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not
    affect our raw material supply. Even if we have multiple sources
    of supply for a raw material, there can be no assurance that
    these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier.
    There cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be
    affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of
    supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole
    supplier. In addition, the price of raw materials varies, often
    substantially, from year to year.

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are
    commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply/demand
    fundamentals change. Our production facilities rely largely on
    fuel oil, natural gas and electricity for energy. Most of the
    raw materials for our European operations are centrally
    purchased by one of our subsidiaries, which also buys raw
    materials on behalf of third parties. We manage our exposure
    through forward purchase contracts, long-term supply agreements
    and multi-year purchasing and sales agreements. During 2009, we
    did not enter into any commodity financial derivative contracts.
    See Note 2 and Note 22 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

We also currently purchase and lease supplies of various
    precious metals, such as rhodium, used as catalysts for the
    manufacture of Acetyl Intermediates products. For precious
    metals, the leases are distributed between a minimum of three
    lessors per product and are divided into several contracts.

Research
    and Development

All of our businesses conduct research and development
    activities to increase competitiveness. Our businesses are
    innovation-oriented and conduct research and development
    activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production
    technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new
    products and applications. We consider the amount spent during
    each of the last three fiscal years on research and development
    activities to be adequate to drive our strategic initiatives.

Intellectual
    Property

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    product and process developments in our major markets. Patents
    may cover processes, products, intermediate products and product
    uses. We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a



means of protecting the brand names of our products, which brand
    names become more important once the corresponding products or
    process patents have expired. We protect our trademarks
    vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design
    protection where appropriate.

In most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new
    substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications
    and production processes. However, we do business in regions of
    the world where intellectual property protection may be limited
    and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information
    security policies and procedures wherever we do business. Such
    information security policies and procedures include data
    encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of
    confidential information, as well as employee awareness
    training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors and vigorously
    defend and enforce infringements on our intellectual property
    rights.

Neither Celanese nor any particular business segment is
    materially dependent upon any one particular patent, trademark,
    copyright or trade secret.

Many of our employees are unionized, particularly in Germany,
    Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Belgium and France. However, in the
    United States, less than one quarter of our employees are
    unionized. Moreover, in Germany and France, wages and general
    working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated
    collective bargaining agreements. Within the limits established
    by these agreements, our various subsidiaries negotiate directly
    with the



unions and other labor organizations, such as workers’
    councils, representing the employees. Collective bargaining
    agreements between the German chemical employers associations
    and unions relating to remuneration generally have a term of one
    year, while in the United States a three year term for
    collective bargaining agreements is typical. We offer
    comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and
    believe our relations with employees are satisfactory.

Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the
    level of future sales activity. In general, we do not
    manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production
    and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders
    as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe
    that backlog information is not material to understanding our
    overall business and should not be considered a reliable
    indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of
    revenue or financial performance.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Many factors could have an effect on our financial condition,
    cash flows and results of operations. We are subject to various
    risks resulting from changing economic, environmental,
    political, industry, business and financial conditions. The
    factors described below represent our principal risks.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The
    worldwide economic downturn and difficult conditions in the
    global capital and credit markets have affected and may continue
    to adversely affect our business, as well as the industries of
    many of our customers and suppliers, which are cyclical in
    nature.

Some of the markets in which our end-use customers participate,
    such as the automotive, electrical, construction and textile
    industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us
    which is beyond our control. These markets are highly
    competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use markets, and
    may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for
    and pricing of our products.

Recent declines in consumer and business confidence and
    spending, together with severe reductions in the availability
    and cost of credit and volatility in the capital and credit
    markets, have adversely affected the business and economic
    environment in which we operate and the profitability of our
    business. Our business is exposed to risks associated with the
    creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business
    partners. In particular, we are exposed to risks associated with
    reduced levels of automotive and textile production and declines
    in the housing market. These conditions have resulted in
    financial instability or other adverse effects at many of our
    suppliers, customers or business partners. The consequences of
    such adverse effects could include the interruption of
    production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction,
    delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the
    inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our
    products, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw



materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or
    other creditors. The continuation of any of these events may
    adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial
    condition.

During 2008 and 2009, as a result of the economic downturn,
    lenders and institutional investors reduced and, in some cases,
    ceased to provide funding to borrowers reducing the availability
    of liquidity and credit to fund or support the continuation and
    expansion of business operations worldwide. Although the markets
    have stabilized since 2008, future disruption of the credit
    markets could adversely affect our customer’s access to
    credit which supports the continuation and expansion of their
    businesses worldwide and could result in contract cancellations
    or suspensions, payment delays or defaults by our customers.

We are
    a company with operations around the world and are exposed to
    general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks
    in the countries in which we have significant
    operations.

We operate in the global market and have customers in many
    countries. We have major facilities primarily located in North
    America, Europe and Asia, and hold interests in ventures that
    operate in the US, Germany, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
    and Saudi Arabia. Our principal customers are similarly global
    in scope, and the prices of our most significant products are
    typically world market prices. Consequently, our business and
    financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by
    world economic, political and regulatory conditions.

In addition to the worldwide economic downturn, conditions such
    as the uncertainties associated with war, terrorist activities,
    epidemics, pandemics, weather or political instability in any of
    the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing
    delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and
    products, as well as increasing security costs, insurance
    premiums and other expenses. These conditions could also result
    in or lengthen economic recession in the United States, Europe,
    Asia or elsewhere.

Moreover, changes in laws or regulations, such as unexpected
    changes in regulatory requirements (including import or export
    licensing requirements), or changes in the reporting
    requirements of the United States, German or European Union
    (“EU”) governmental agencies, could increase the cost
    of doing business in these regions. Any of these conditions may
    have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole
    and may result in volatile current and future prices for our
    securities, including our stock.

In particular, we have invested significant resources in China
    and other Asian countries. This region’s growth has slowed
    and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated
    with our investment there and our financial results may be
    adversely impacted.

We are
    subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the
    prices and availability of key raw materials and
    energy.

We purchase significant amounts of natural gas, ethylene and
    methanol from third parties for use in our production of basic
    chemicals in the Acetyl Intermediates segment, principally
    formaldehyde, acetic acid and VAM. We use a portion of our
    output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in the production
    of further products in all our business segments. We also
    purchase significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our
    production of cellulose acetate in the Consumer Specialties
    segment. The price of many of these items is dependent on the
    available supply of such item and may increase significantly as
    a result of production disruptions or strikes. For example, the
    unplanned shutdown of our Clear Lake, Texas facility during 2007
    together with other tight supply conditions caused a shortage of
    acetic acid and increased the price for such product.

We are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials
    and energy. Although we have agreements providing for the supply
    of natural gas, ethylene, wood pulp, electricity and fuel oil,
    the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary
    with market conditions and may be highly volatile. Factors that
    have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past
    and which may do so in the future include:

•

Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from
    growing uses or new uses;

•

Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, labor
    disruption or involuntary shutdowns;



•

The general level of business and economic activity; and

•

The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.

If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy
    and raw material costs, or if such commodities were unavailable,
    it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial
    results.

Failure
    to develop new products and production technologies or to
    implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives
    successfully may harm our competitive position.

Our operating results, especially in our Consumer Specialties
    and Advanced Engineered Materials segments, depend significantly
    on the development of commercially viable new products, product
    grades and applications, as well as production technologies. If
    we are unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and
    production processes in the future, our competitive position and
    operating results may be negatively affected. Likewise, we have
    undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all
    business segments to improve productivity and performance and to
    generate cost savings. These initiatives may not be completed or
    beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities
    may not be realized.

Recent
    federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain
    chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be
    proposed in the future could, if passed into law, require us to
    relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to
    alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical
    products, thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Regulations have recently been issued by the US Department of
    Homeland Security (“DHS”) aimed at decreasing the
    risk, and effects, of potential terrorist attacks on chemical
    plants located within the United States. Pursuant to these
    regulations, these goals would be accomplished in part through
    the requirement that certain high-priority facilities develop a
    prevention, preparedness, and response plan after conducting a
    vulnerability assessment. In addition, companies may be required
    to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals
    and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and
    prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in
    order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a
    terrorist attack. We have registered certain of our sites with
    DHS in accordance with these regulations, and are conducting
    vulnerability assessments for our sites and until that is done
    we cannot state with certainty the costs associated with any
    security plans that DHS may require. These regulations may be
    revised further, and additional legislation may be proposed in
    the future on this topic. It is possible that such future
    legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than
    what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to
    us. We cannot predict the final form of currently pending
    legislation, or other related legislation that may be passed and
    can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations in a future
    reporting period.

Environmental
    regulations and other obligations relating to environmental
    matters could subject us to liability for fines,

clean-ups

and other damages, require us to incur significant costs to
    modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and
    delivery costs.

Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and potential obligations with respect to
    contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our
    operating results. These obligations include the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
    (“CERCLA”) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery
    Act of 1976 (“RCRA”) related to sites currently or
    formerly owned or operated by us, or where waste from our
    operations was disposed. We also have obligations related to the
    indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer
    agreement between Celanese GmbH and Hoechst, also referred to as
    the demerger agreement, for environmental matters arising out of
    certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger.

Our operations are subject to extensive international, national,
    state, local and other supranational laws and regulations that
    govern environmental and health and safety matters, including
    CERCLA and RCRA. We incur substantial capital and other costs to
    comply with these requirements. If we violate them, we can be
    held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions, including
    limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or
    revocations of environmental permits involved. Stricter
    environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and
    enforcement



policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us
    or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling,
    manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants
    to more rigorous scrutiny than at present. Consequently,
    compliance with these laws and regulations could result in
    significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and
    liabilities, which could cause our business and operating
    results to be less favorable than expected. An adverse outcome
    in these claim procedures may negatively affect our earnings and
    cash flows in a particular reporting period.

Changes
    in environmental, health and safety regulations in the
    jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products could
    lead to a decrease in demand for our products.

New or revised governmental regulations and independent studies
    relating to the effect of our products on health, safety and the
    environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of
    producing our products.

In June 2009, the California Office of Environmental Health
    Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) formally proposed to list
    vinyl acetate monomer (“VAM”), along with 11 other
    substances, to a list of chemicals “known to the state of
    California” to cause cancer. OEHHA is required to maintain
    this list under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement
    Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65”). Celanese filed
    comments in opposition to the proposed listing because the
    listing was not based on a scientific review of the relevant
    data and the legal standard for adding VAM to the Proposition 65
    list had not been met. Celanese also filed an action in the
    Sacramento County Supervisor Court seeking declaration that
    OEHHA’s proposed listing of VAM would be contrary to law.
    The Superior Court granted Celanese’s request for relief.
    It is anticipated that OEHHA will appeal that decision.

We can provide no assurance that the Sacramento County Superior
    Court decision will be affirmed on appeal, or that VAM or other
    chemicals we produce will not be classified in other
    jurisdictions in a manner that would adversely affect demand for
    such products.

We are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from
    formaldehyde. Several studies have investigated possible links
    between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including
    leukemia. The International Agency for Research on Cancer
    (“IARC”), a private research agency, has reclassified
    formaldehyde from Group 2A (probable human carcinogen) to Group
    1 (known human carcinogen) based on studies linking formaldehyde
    exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer in humans. In
    October 2009, IARC also concluded based on a recent study that
    there is sufficient evidence for a casual association between
    formaldehyde and the development of leukemia. We expect the
    results of IARC’s review will be examined and considered by
    government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and
    environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements.

Other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological
    testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals,
    including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives
    include the Voluntary Children’s Chemical Evaluation
    Program, High Production Volume Chemical Initiative and expected
    modifications to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the
    United States, as well as various European Commission programs,
    such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and
    Restriction of Chemicals (REACh).

The above-mentioned assessments in the United States and Europe
    may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved
    and additional requirements being placed on the production,
    handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such
    concerns and additional requirements could also increase the
    cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and
    otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a
    decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand
    would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to risks associated with possible climate change
    legislation, regulation and international accords.

Greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of
    a large amount of international, national, regional, state and
    local attention. Cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse
    gas emissions have been introduced in the EU. Similarly,
    numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in
    the US Congress, which could adversely impact all industries. In
    addition, future regulation of greenhouse gas could occur
    pursuant to future US treaty obligations, statutory or
    regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act or new climate change
    legislation.



While not all are likely to become law, this is a strong
    indication that additional climate change related mandates will
    be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely
    impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material
    prices and establishing costly emissions trading schemes and
    requiring modification of equipment.

A step toward potential federal restriction on greenhouse gas
    emissions was taken on December 7, 2009 when the
    Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued its
    Endangerment Finding in response to a decision of the Supreme
    Court of the United States. The EPA found that the emission of
    six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (which is emitted
    from the combustion of fossil fuels), may reasonably be
    anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this
    finding, the EPA defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases
    to be “air pollution” subject to regulation under the
    Clean Air Act. Although the EPA has stated a preference that
    greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation
    rather than the existing Clean Air Act, many sources of
    greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated without the need for
    further legislation.

The US Congress is considering legislation that would create an
    economy-wide

“cap-and-trade”

system that would establish a limit (or cap) on overall
    greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase
    and sale of emissions permits or “allowances.” Under
    the leading

cap-and-trade

proposals before Congress, the chemical industry likely would be
    affected due to anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel
    providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances, which
    they would be required to obtain, to cover the emissions from
    fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the Company or
    its energy suppliers. In addition,

cap-and-trade

proposals would likely increase the cost of energy, including
    purchases of steam and electricity, and certain raw materials
    used by the Company. Other countries are also considering or
    have implemented

“cap-and-trade”

systems. Future environmental regulatory developments related to
    climate change are possible, which could materially increase
    operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase
    our manufacturing and delivery costs.

Our
    production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and
    hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that
    could have a negative effect on our operating
    results.

Our operations are subject to operating risks associated with
    chemical manufacturing, including the related storage and
    transportation of raw materials, products and waste. These risks
    include, among other things, pipeline and storage tank leaks and
    ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or releases of
    toxic or hazardous substances.

These operating risks can cause personal injury, property damage
    and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown
    of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal
    penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt
    production and have a negative effect on the productivity and
    profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our
    operating results and cash flows.

Production
    at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety
    of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our
    products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’
    demands.

A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could
    have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions
    could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters,
    weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems,
    disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government
    regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient
    capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost
    substantially more or may take a significant time to start
    production, each of which could negatively affect our business
    and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing
    facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended
    period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused
    by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our
    customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek other
    suppliers. For example, during 2007, production was disrupted
    for an extended period of time at our Clear Lake, Texas facility
    that produces primarily acetic acid and VAM. The disruption was
    caused by an unplanned outage of our acetic acid unit. Because
    of this disruption, the volumes of our Acetyl Intermediates
    segment were lower than we had expected for 2007 as we were
    unable to fully offset the lost production. Similar outages
    could occur in the future from unexpected disruptions at any of
    our other manufacturing facilities of key products. Such outages
    could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in
    future reporting periods.



Our
    business and financial results may be adversely affected by
    various legal and regulatory proceedings.

We are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and
    claims in the normal course of business and could become subject
    to additional claims in the future, some of which could be
    material. The outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and
    claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of
    litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to
    reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead us to
    change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance
    receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters
    previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a
    significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant
    settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in
    applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or
    unfavorable development could result in charges that could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
    or financial condition in any particular period. For a more
    detailed discussion of our legal proceedings, see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

below.

We may
    experience unexpected difficulties and incur unexpected costs in
    the relocation of our Ticona plant from Kelsterbach to the Rhine
    Main area, which may increase our costs, delay the transition or
    disrupt our ability to supply our customers.

We have agreed with Frankfurt, Germany Airport
    (“Fraport”) to relocate our Kelsterbach, Germany
    business, resolving several years of legal disputes related to
    the planned Frankfurt airport expansion. As a result of the
    settlement, we will transition Ticona’s operations from
    Kelsterbach to another location in Germany by mid-2011. In July
    2007, we announced that we would relocate the Kelsterbach,
    Germany business to the Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine
    Main area. Over a five-year period, Fraport agreed to pay Ticona
    a total of €670 million to offset the costs associated
    with the transition of the business from its current location
    and the closure of the Kelsterbach plant. While the settlement
    and related payment amount was meant to be cost-neutral and
    represent the amount required to select a site, build new
    production facilities, demolish old production facilities and
    transition business activities according to schedule and without
    any disruptions to customer supply, we may encounter unexpected
    costs or other difficulties during the relocation process that
    bring the total costs of the relocation to an amount greater
    than the compensation provided by Fraport. The relocation of
    these facilities represents a major logistical undertaking, and
    we may have underestimated the amount that will be required to
    carry out every aspect of the relocation. We may lose the
    services of valuable experienced employees during the transition
    if they decide not to work at the new location. The construction
    of the new facilities may not be complete on time or may face
    cost overruns. If our costs relating to the relocation exceed
    the amount of payments from Fraport or if the relocation causes
    other unexpected difficulties, our expenses may increase or
    supplies to our customers may be disrupted.

If supply to our customers is disrupted for an extended period,
    this could negatively impact the reputation of this business and
    result in the loss of customers. Such effects could have an
    adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods.

Our
    significant non-US operations expose us to global exchange rate
    fluctuations that could adversely impact our
    profitability.

Because we conduct a significant portion of our operations
    outside the United States, fluctuations in currencies of other
    countries, especially the Euro, may materially affect our
    operating results. For example, changes in currency exchange
    rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of
    our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets
    and increase the cost of items required in our operations.

A substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in
    currencies other than the US dollar. In our consolidated
    financial statements, we translate our local currency financial
    results into US dollars based on average exchange rates
    prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the
    end of that period. During times of a strengthening US dollar
    our reported international sales, earnings, assets and
    liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will
    translate into fewer US dollars.

In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency
    transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries
    enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a
    currency different from the operating subsidiary’s
    functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we
    may not be able to manage our currency transaction and
    translation risks effectively, and volatility in currency
    exchange rates may expose our financial



condition or results of operations to a significant additional
    risk. Since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be
    denominated in currencies other than US dollars, a weakening of
    the US dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our
    indebtedness.

We use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign
    currency fluctuations, but we cannot guarantee that our hedging
    strategies will be effective. Failure to effectively manage
    these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

Significant
    changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions
    relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the
    valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension
    plans and our pension cost.

The cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of
    time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of
    time. Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan
    assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present
    value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is
    materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension
    obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those
    obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment
    performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets
    can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the
    valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in
    a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. During
    2008, the value of our plan assets declined significantly due to
    the decline in the overall equity markets. A change in the
    discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease
    in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported
    funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic
    pension cost in the following fiscal years. In recent years, an
    extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been
    implemented to minimize the influence of liability volatility
    due to interest rate movements. Similarly, changes in the
    expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes
    in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal years. If
    the value of our pension fund’s portfolio declines or does
    not perform as expected or if our experience with the fund leads
    us to change our assumptions regarding the fund, we may be
    required to contribute additional capital to the fund.

Our
    future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Our inability to enforce these
    rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position
    and our profit margins.

We attach great importance to our patents, trademarks,
    copyrights and product designs in order to protect our
    investment in research and development, manufacturing and
    marketing. We also license patents and other technology from
    third parties. Our policy is to seek the widest possible
    protection for significant product and process developments in
    our major markets. Patents may cover processes, products,
    intermediate products and product uses. Protection for
    individual products extends for varying periods in accordance
    with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of
    patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which
    may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
    patent and its scope of coverage. As patents expire, the
    products and processes described and claimed in those patents
    become generally available for use by the public. We also seek
    to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the
    brand names of our products, which brand names become more
    important once the corresponding product or process patents have
    expired. Our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions
    of the world where intellectual property protection may be
    limited and difficult to enforce. If we are not successful in
    protecting or maintaining our patent, license, trademark or
    other intellectual property rights, our revenues, results of
    operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.

Provisions
    in certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as any
    shareholders’ rights plan, may discourage a takeover
    attempt.

Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire
    us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders.
    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose
    various procedural and other requirements, which could make it
    more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate
    actions. For example, our certificate of incorporation
    authorizes our Board of Directors to determine the rights,
    preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of
    preferred stock, without any vote or action by our shareholders.
    Thus, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of
    preferred stock with



voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the
    voting or other rights of holders of our Series A common
    stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring
    a change of control of our Company. In addition, a change of
    control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of
    our having three classes of directors (each class elected for a
    three year term) or as a result of any shareholders’ rights
    plan that our Board of Directors may adopt. These provisions
    could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to
    pay in the future for shares of our Series A common stock.

Risks
    Related to the Acquisition of Celanese GmbH, formerly Celanese
    AG

The
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss
    transfer agreement (“Domination Agreement”) and/or the
    compensation paid in connection with the squeeze-out may be
    increased, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser can
    otherwise make available to us.

Several minority shareholders of Celanese GmbH have initiated
    special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement. On
    December 12, 2006, the Frankfurt District Court appointed
    an expert to help determine the value of Celanese AG as of
    July 31, 2004, on which date an extraordinary shareholder
    meeting of Celanese AG was held to resolve the Domination
    Agreement. As a result of these proceedings, the amounts of the
    fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment
    could be increased by the court, and the Purchaser would be
    required to make such payments within two months after the
    publication of the court’s ruling. Any such increase may be
    substantial. All minority shareholders would be entitled to
    claim the respective higher amounts. This may reduce the funds
    the Purchaser can make available to us and, accordingly,
    diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness. See
    Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further information.

The Company also received applications for the commencement of
    award proceedings filed by 79 shareholders against the
    Purchaser with the Frankfurt District Court requesting the court
    to set a higher amount for the Squeeze-Out compensation. Should
    the court set a higher value for the Squeeze-Out compensation,
    former Celanese AG shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of
    Celanese AG due to the Squeeze-Out are entitled, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement between the Purchaser and certain former
    Celanese AG shareholders, to claim for their shares the higher
    of the compensation amounts determined by the court in these
    different proceedings. Previously received compensation for
    their shares will be offset so that those shareholders who
    ceased to be shareholders of Celanese AG due to the Squeeze-Out
    are not entitled to more than higher of the amount set in the
    two court proceedings.

The
    Purchaser may be required to compensate Celanese GmbH for annual
    losses, which may reduce the funds the Purchaser can otherwise
    make available to us.

Under the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser is required, among
    other things, to compensate Celanese GmbH for any annual loss
    incurred, determined in accordance with German accounting
    requirements, by Celanese GmbH at the end of the fiscal year in
    which the loss was incurred. This obligation to compensate
    Celanese GmbH for annual losses will apply during the entire
    term of the Domination Agreement. If Celanese GmbH incurs losses
    during any period of the operative term of the Domination
    Agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of Celanese
    GmbH at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the
    Domination Agreement, the Purchaser will be obligated to make a
    corresponding cash payment to Celanese GmbH to the extent that
    the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the
    dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of Celanese
    GmbH during the term of the Domination Agreement. The Purchaser
    may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to Celanese GmbH by
    off-setting against such loss compensation claims by Celanese
    GmbH any valuable counterclaims against Celanese GmbH that the
    Purchaser may have. If the Purchaser is obligated to make cash
    payments to Celanese GmbH to cover an annual loss, we may not
    have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when
    due and, unless the Purchaser is able to obtain funds from a
    source other than annual profits of Celanese GmbH, the Purchaser
    may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such
    shortfall. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Since the Domination Agreement has been terminated
    effective as of December 31, 2009, there will be no
    obligation by the Purchaser to compensate Celanese GmbH for any
    losses incurred after December 31, 2009.



We and
    two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with
    respect to the Purchaser’s obligation under the Domination
    Agreement and intercompany indebtedness to Celanese GmbH, which
    may diminish our ability to make payments on our
    indebtedness.

Our subsidiaries, Celanese International Holdings Luxembourg
    S.à r.l. (“CIH”), formerly Celanese Caylux
    Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A., and Celanese US, have each agreed to
    provide the Purchaser with financing so that the Purchaser is at
    all times in a position to completely meet its obligations
    under, or in connection with, the Domination Agreement. In
    addition, Celanese has guaranteed (i) that the Purchaser
    will meet its obligation under the Domination Agreement to
    compensate Celanese GmbH for any annual loss incurred by
    Celanese GmbH during the term of the Domination Agreement; and
    (ii) the repayment of all existing intercompany
    indebtedness of Celanese’s subsidiaries to Celanese GmbH.
    Further, under the terms of Celanese’s guarantee, in
    certain limited circumstances Celanese GmbH may be entitled to
    require the immediate repayment of some or all of the
    intercompany indebtedness owed by Celanese’s subsidiaries
    to Celanese GmbH. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under their
    obligations to the Purchaser or Celanese GmbH, as the case may
    be, or if the intercompany indebtedness owed to Celanese GmbH is
    accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds for payments on
    our indebtedness when due. Since the Domination Agreement has
    been terminated effective as of December 31, 2009, there
    will be no obligation by the Purchaser to compensate Celanese
    GmbH for any losses incurred after December 31, 2009 and
    our subsidiaries will be released from their obligations.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Debt and Other Obligations.

Our
    level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise
    additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to
    react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and
    prevent us from meeting obligations under our
    indebtedness.

Our total indebtedness is approximately $3.5 billion as of
    December 31, 2009.

Our debt could have important consequences, including:

•    increasing vulnerability to
    general economic and industry conditions including exacerbating
    any adverse business effects that are determined to be material
    adverse effects under our senior credit facility;

•    requiring a substantial portion of
    cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of
    principal and interest on indebtedness, therefore reducing our
    ability to use our cash flow to fund operations, capital
    expenditures and future business opportunities;

•    exposing us to the risk of
    increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at
    variable rates of interest;

•    limiting our ability to obtain
    additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
    product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and
    general corporate or other purposes; and

•    limiting our ability to adjust to
    changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive
    disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.

A breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument
    governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a
    default under that instrument and, due to cross-default
    provisions, could result in a default under our senior credit
    facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the
    senior credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all
    amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and
    terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were
    unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against
    the collateral, if any, granted to them to secure the
    indebtedness. If the lenders under the senior credit facility
    were to accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, there is no
    guarantee that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to
    repay in full our outstanding indebtedness.



Moreover, the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit
    us or our subsidiaries from incurring substantial additional
    indebtedness in the future. If new debt, including amounts
    available under our senior credit agreement, is added to our
    current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could
    intensify. See also

Item 7. Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Debt and Other Obligations.

Our
    variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk,
    which could cause our debt service obligations to increase
    significantly and affect our operating results.

Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and
    expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to
    increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate
    indebtedness would increase, net of the impacts of hedges in
    place. As of December 31, 2009, we had $2.2 billion,
    €440 million and CNY 1.4 billion of variable rate
    debt, of which $1.6 billion and €150 million is
    hedged with interest rate swaps, which leaves $643 million,
    €290 million and CNY 1.4 billion of variable rate
    debt subject to interest rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1%
    increase in interest rates would increase annual interest
    expense by approximately $13 million.

Our senior credit agreement consists of $2,280 million of
    US dollar denominated and €400 million of Euro
    denominated term loans due 2014, a $600 million revolving
    credit facility terminating in 2013 and a $228 million
    credit-linked revolving facility terminating in 2014. Borrowings
    under the senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable
    interest rate based on LIBOR (for US dollars) or EURIBOR (for
    Euros), as applicable, or, for US dollar denominated loans under
    certain circumstances, a base rate, in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term loans and
    any loans under the credit-linked revolving facility is 1.75%,
    subject to potential reductions as defined in the new senior
    credit agreement. The term loans under the senior credit
    agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the initial
    principal amount per annum, payable quarterly, commencing in
    July 2007. The remaining principal amount of the term loans will
    be due on April 2, 2014.

An increase in interest rates could have an adverse impact on
    our future results of operations and cash flows. See also

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
    Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk Management.

We may
    not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our
    indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy
    obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be
    successful.

Our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand,
    receipt of additional capital, including possible additional
    borrowings, and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of
    distributions, advances or cash payments.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on the financial condition and
    operating performance of our subsidiaries, which is subject to
    prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain
    financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may
    not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
    activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
    premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or
    delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital
    or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such
    operating results and resources, we could face substantial
    liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material
    assets or operations to meet our debt service and other
    obligations. The senior credit agreement governing our
    indebtedness restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use
    the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to
    consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we
    could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate
    to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Restrictive
    covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to
    engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to
    make payments on our indebtedness.

The senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains
    various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified
    types of transactions. The covenants contained in the senior
    credit agreement limit our ability to, among other things, incur
    additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other
    distributions on or repurchase capital



stock or make other restricted payments, make investments and
    sell certain assets. Such restrictions in our debt instruments
    could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders
    in order to take certain actions. Recent disruptions in credit
    markets may prevent us from or make it more difficult or more
    costly for us to obtain such consents from our lenders. Our
    ability to expand our business or to address declines in our
    business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents.

In addition, the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain
    a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are
    outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Our
    ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events
    beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet this test at
    all.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default
    under the senior credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an
    event of default under the senior credit agreement, the lenders
    could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior
    credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate
    all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to
    repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior credit
    agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them
    to secure that indebtedness. Our subsidiaries have pledged a
    significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior
    credit agreement. If the lenders under the senior credit
    agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not
    have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the
    senior credit agreement as well as their other indebtedness,
    which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our
    stock.

The
    terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of
    Celanese Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or
    otherwise transfer their assets to us.

Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our
    ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the
    distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, the terms
    of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of Celanese
    Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise
    transfer their assets to us. Accordingly, our ability to pay
    dividends on our stock is similarly limited.

Legal

We are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings,

    proceedings, lawsuits and claims, we are actively defending
    those matters where the Company is named as a defendant.
    Additionally, we believe, based on the advice of legal counsel,
    that adequate reserves have been made and that the ultimate
    outcomes of all such litigation claims will not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, but may have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash

Holders

No shares of Celanese’s Series B common stock are
    issued and outstanding. As of February 5, 2010, there were
    64 holders of record of our Series A common stock, and one
    holder of record of our 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred
    stock (“Preferred Stock”). By including persons
    holding shares in broker accounts under street names, however,
    we estimate our shareholder base to be approximately 28,000 as
    of February 5, 2010.

On February 1, 2010, we announced we would elect to redeem
    all of our 9,600,000 outstanding shares of our Preferred Stock
    on February 22, 2010 (“Redemption Date”). On
    that date, each share of our Preferred Stock will be redeemed
    for a number of shares of our Series A common stock equal
    to the redemption price ($25.06) divided by 97.5% of the average
    closing price of our Series A common stock for the 10
    trading days ending on the fifth trading day prior to
    February 22, 2010.

Holders of the Preferred Stock also have the right to convert
    their shares at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City
    time, on February 19, 2010, the business day immediately
    preceding the Redemption Date. Holders who want to convert
    their shares of our Preferred Stock must satisfy all of the
    requirements as defined in the Certificate of Designations prior
    to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, in order to effect
    conversion of their shares of Preferred Stock. Each share of
    Preferred Stock is convertible into 1.2600 shares of our
    Series A common stock, subject to adjustment under certain
    circumstances as set forth in the Certificates of Designations.

Dividend
    Policy

Our Board of Directors adopted a policy of declaring, subject to
    legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share
    of our Series A common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per
    share unless our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion,
    determines otherwise. Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly
    dividends of $0.04 per share on February 1, 2009,
    May 1, 2009, August 3, 2009 and November 2, 2009
    and similar quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2008. The
    annual cash dividend declared and paid during the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $23 million and
    $24 million, respectively. Dividends payable to holders of
    our Series A common stock cannot be declared or paid nor
    can any funds be set aside for the payment thereof, unless we
    have paid or set aside funds for the payment of all accumulated
    and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of our Preferred
    Stock, as described below. Our Board of Directors may, at any
    time, modify or revoke our dividend policy on our Series A
    common stock.



We are required under the terms of our Preferred Stock to pay
    scheduled quarterly dividends, subject to legally available
    funds. For so long as the Preferred Stock remains outstanding,
    (1) we will not declare, pay or set apart funds for the
    payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to
    any junior stock or parity stock and (2) neither we, nor
    any of our subsidiaries, will, subject to certain exceptions,
    redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration junior
    stock or parity stock through a sinking fund or otherwise, in
    each case unless we have paid or set apart funds for the payment
    of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the
    shares of Preferred Stock and any parity stock for all preceding
    dividend periods. Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly
    dividends of $0.265625 per share on our Preferred Stock on
    February 1, 2009, May 1, 2009, August 3, 2009 and
    November 2, 2009 and similar quarterly dividends during
    each quarter of 2008. The annual cash dividend declared and paid
    during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
    $10 million and $10 million, respectively.

On January 5, 2010, we declared a cash dividend of
    $0.265625 per share on our Preferred Stock amounting to
    $3 million and a cash dividend of $0.04 per share on our
    Series A common stock amounting to $6 million. Both
    cash dividends are for the period from November 2, 2009 to
    January 31, 2010 and were paid on February 1, 2010 to
    holders of record as of January 15, 2010.

On February 1, 2010, we announced we would elect to redeem
    all of our outstanding Preferred Stock on February 22,
    2010. Holders of the Preferred Stock also have the right to
    convert their shares at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New
    York City time, on February 19, 2010, the business day
    immediately preceding the February 22, 2010 redemption date.

Based on the number of outstanding shares as of
    December 31, 2009 and considering the redemption of our
    Preferred Stock, cash dividends to be paid in 2010 are expected
    to result in annual dividend payments less than those paid in
    2009.

The amount available to us to pay cash dividends is restricted
    by our senior credit agreement. Any decision to declare and pay
    dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our
    Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our
    results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition,
    contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of
    Directors may deem relevant.

Our deferred compensation plan offers certain of our senior
    employees and directors the opportunity to defer a portion of
    their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal
    to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts based upon the
    market-performance of specified measurement funds selected by
    the participant. These deferred compensation obligations may be
    considered securities of Celanese. Participants were required to
    make deferral elections under the plan prior to January 1 of the
    year such deferrals will be withheld from their compensation. We
    relied on the exemption from registration provided by
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act in making this offer to
    a select group of employees, fewer than 35 of which were
    non-accredited investors under the rules promulgated by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

In this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the term “Celanese” refers to Celanese Corporation, a
    Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the
    “Company,” “we,” “our” and
    “us” refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a
    consolidated basis. The term “Celanese US” refers to
    our subsidiary Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
    liability company, formerly known as BCP Crystal US Holdings
    Corp., a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The
    term “Purchaser” refers to our subsidiary, Celanese
    Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known as BCP
    Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG, a German limited
    partnership, and not its subsidiaries, except where otherwise
    indicated.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of the
    financial condition and the results of operations together with
    the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes
    to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“US GAAP”).

Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements
    contained in this section involve both risk and uncertainty.
    Several important factors could cause actual results to differ
    materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of
    these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore,
    beyond the control of management. See “Forward-Looking
    Statements May Prove Inaccurate” below.

Reconciliation of Non-US GAAP Measures: We believe that
    using non-US GAAP financial measures to supplement US GAAP
    results is useful to investors because such use provides a more
    complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the
    business other than disclosing US GAAP results alone. In this
    regard, we disclose net debt, which is a non-US GAAP financial
    measure. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash
    equivalents. We use net debt to evaluate the capital structure.
    Net debt is not a substitute for any US GAAP financial measure.
    In addition, calculations of net debt contained in this report
    may not be consistent with that of other companies. The most
    directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance
    with US GAAP in our financial statements for net debt is total
    debt. For a reconciliation of net debt to total debt, see
    “Financial Highlights” below.

Forward-Looking
    Statements May Prove Inaccurate

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and other
    parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking
    statements and information relating to us that are based on the
    beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and
    information currently available to, us. When used in this
    document, words such as “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “plan” and “project” and
    similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to
    identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect
    our current views with respect to future events, are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
    uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Further, certain
    forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to
    future events that may not prove to be accurate. We assume no
    obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements
    for any reason, except as required by law.

See

Item 1A. Risk Factors

for a description of risk
    factors that could significantly affect our financial results.
    In addition, the following factors could cause our actual
    results to differ materially from those results, performance or
    achievements that may be expressed or implied by such
    forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other
    things:

•       changes in
    general economic, business, political and regulatory conditions
    in the countries or regions in which we operate;

•       the length and
    depth of product and industry business cycles particularly in
    the automotive, electrical, electronics and construction
    industries;

•       changes in the
    price and availability of raw materials, particularly changes in
    the demand for, supply of, and market prices of ethylene,
    methanol, natural gas, wood pulp, fuel oil and electricity;

•       the ability to
    pass increases in raw material prices on to customers or
    otherwise improve margins through price increases;



•       the ability to
    maintain plant utilization rates and to implement planned
    capacity additions and expansions;

•       the ability to
    reduce production costs and improve productivity by implementing
    technological improvements to existing plants;

•       increased price
    competition and the introduction of competing products by other
    companies;

•       changes in the
    degree of intellectual property and other legal protection
    afforded to our products;

•       compliance costs
    and potential disruption or interruption of production due to
    accidents or other unforeseen events or delays in construction
    of facilities;

•       potential
    liability for remedial actions and increased costs under
    existing or future environmental regulations, including those
    related to climate change;

•       potential
    liability resulting from pending or future litigation, or from
    changes in the laws, regulations or policies of governments or
    other governmental activities in the countries in which we
    operate;

•       changes in
    currency exchange rates and interest rates; and

•       various other
    factors, both referenced and not referenced in this document.

Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are,
    therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks
    or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions
    prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements
    may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report
    as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned
    or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to
    update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
    their dates.

Overview

During 2009, we made significant progress in executing our
    strategic objectives. As detailed below, we optimized our
    portfolio, realigned our manufacturing footprint, continued our
    expansion efforts in Asia, made technological advancements, and
    took other strategic actions to deliver value for our
    shareholders.

    Highlights:

•       We announced the
    Frankfurt, Germany Airport (“Fraport”) supervisory
    board approved the acceleration of the 2009 and 2010 payments of
    €200 million and €140 million, respectively,
    required by the settlement agreement signed in June 2007. On
    February 5, 2009, we received a discounted amount of
    approximately €322 million ($412 million),
    excluding value-added tax of €59 million
    ($75 million).

•       We shut down our
    vinyl acetate monomer (“VAM”) production unit in
    Cangrejera, Mexico, and ceased VAM production at the site during
    the first quarter of 2009.

•       Standard and
    Poor’s affirmed our ratings and revised our outlook from
    positive to stable in February 2009.

•       We received the
    American Chemistry Council’s (“ACC”) Responsible
    Care

®

Sustained Excellence Award for mid-size companies. The annual
    award, the most prestigious award given under ACC’s
    Responsible
    Care

®

initiative, recognizes companies for outstanding leadership
    under ACC’s Environmental Health and Safety performance
    criteria.

•       We completed the
    sale of our polyvinyl alcohol (“PVOH”) business to
    Sekisui Chemical Co., Ltd. for the net cash purchase price of
    $168 million.

•       We agreed to a
    “Project of Closure” for our acetic acid and VAM
    production operations at our Pardies, France facility. We ceased
    the production of acetic acid and VAM at our facility in
    Pardies, France on December 1, 2009. As a result of the
    Pardies, France Project of Closure, we have incurred
    $89 million of exit costs in 2009. We may incur an
    additional $17 million in contingent employee termination
    benefits relates to the Pardies, France Project of Closure.



•       We announced
    that Celanese US had amended its $650 million revolving
    credit facility. The amendment lowered the total revolver
    commitment to $600 million and increased the first lien
    senior secured leverage ratio for a period of six quarters,
    beginning June 30, 2009 and ending December 31, 2010.

•       We announced the
    creation of our new and proprietary
    AOPlus

®


    acetic acid technology, which allows for expansion up to
    1.5 million tons per reactor annually.

•       We successfully
    started up our expansion of our acetic acid unit in Nanjing,
    China which doubled the unit’s capacity from 600,000 tons
    to 1.2 million tons annually.

•       We announced the
    expansion of our vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions
    (“VAE”) manufacturing facility at our Nanjing, China
    integrated chemical complex to support continued growth plans
    throughout Asia. The expanded facility will double our VAE
    capacity in the region and is expected to be operational in the
    first half of 2011.

•       We launched a
    new, innovative polyacetal (“POM”) technology that is
    expected to create significant additional growth opportunities
    for our Advanced Engineered Materials segment.

•       We signed a
    memorandum of understanding with our acetate joint venture
    partner, the China National Tobacco Corporation, to expand the
    flake and tow capacities at our joint venture facility in
    Nantong, China.

•       We reached a
    long-term agreement to supply VAM to Jiangxi Jiangwei High-Tech
    Stock Co., Ltd (“Jiangwei”). Jiangwei will cease
    production of its calcium carbide-based alternative for economic
    and environmental reasons and source our VAM.

•       We acquired the
    long fiber reinforced thermoplastics (“LFT”) business
    of FACT GmbH (Future Advanced Composites Technology) of Germany,
    supporting our Advanced Engineered Materials segment.

•       We announced the
    redemption of our Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock for our
    Series A Common Stock to be completed February 22,
    2010.

    Outlook

In 2010 we expect to see an increase in overall demand versus
    2009 as the global economy begins a gradual recovery. We would
    also expect growth in Asia to outpace growth in other regions of
    the world. Raw materials and energy costs are expected to be
    modestly higher in 2010 than in the prior year. Additionally, we
    expect to realize an incremental $100 million of fixed
    spending reductions, driven by structural streamlining of our
    manufacturing and administrative functions.

Summary
    of Consolidated Results — Year Ended December 31,
    2009 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008

The challenging economic environment in the United States and
    Europe during the second half of 2008 continued throughout 2009.
    Net sales declined in 2009 from 2008 primarily as a result of
    decreased demand due to the significant weakness of the global
    economy. In July 2009, we completed the sale of our PVOH
    business which also contributed to the declines in our sales
    volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to see a
    gradual recovery in the global economy with increasing demand
    within some of our business segments. A decrease in selling
    prices was also a significant factor on the decrease in net
    sales. Decreases in key raw material and energy costs were the
    primary factors in lower selling prices. A slightly unfavorable
    foreign currency impact also contributed to the decrease in net
    sales.



Gross profit declined due to lower net sales. As a percentage of
    sales, gross profit increased as lower raw material and energy
    costs more than offset decreases in net sales during the period.
    In 2010 we expect raw material and energy costs to increase
    which will partially be offset by increases in selling prices.

During the first quarter of 2009, we began efforts to align
    production capacity and staffing levels with our view of an
    economic environment of prolonged lower demand. For the year
    ended December 31, 2009, other charges included employee
    termination benefits of $40 million related to this
    endeavor. As a result of the shutdown of the vinyl acetate
    monomer (“VAM”) production unit in Cangrejera, Mexico,
    we recognized employee termination benefits of $1 million
    and long-lived asset impairment losses of $1 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2009. The VAM production unit
    in Cangrejera, Mexico is included in our Acetyl Intermediates
    segment.

As a result of the Project of Closure at our Pardies, France
    facility, other charges included exit costs of $89 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, which consisted of
    $60 million in employee termination benefits,
    $17 million of contract termination costs and
    $12 million of long-lived asset impairment losses. The
    Pardies, France facility is included in the Acetyl Intermediates
    segment.

Due to continued declines in demand in automotive and electronic
    sectors, we announced plans to reduce capacity by ceasing
    polyester polymer production at our Ticona manufacturing plant
    in Shelby, North Carolina. Other charges for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 included employee termination benefits of
    $2 million and long-lived asset impairment losses of
    $1 million related to this event. The Shelby, North
    Carolina facility is included in the Advanced Engineered
    Materials segment.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    partially offset by $6 million of insurance recoveries in
    satisfaction of claims we made related to the unplanned outage
    of our Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid facility during 2007, a
    $9 million decrease in legal reserves for plumbing claims
    due to the Company’s ongoing assessment of the likely
    outcome of the plumbing actions and the expiration of the
    statute of limitation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased during
    2009 primarily due to business optimization and finance
    improvement initiatives.

Operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher
    other charges partially offset by lower selling, general and
    administrative costs.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased slightly during
    2009, primarily due to reduced earnings from our Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased
    demand.

Our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 was (101)% compared to 15% for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Our effective tax rate for
    2009 was favorably impacted by the release of the US valuation
    allowance, partially offset by lower earnings in jurisdictions
    participating in tax holidays, increases in valuation allowances
    on certain foreign net deferred tax assets and the effect of new
    tax legislation in Mexico.

    December 31, 2008 compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

The challenging economic environment in the United States and
    Europe during the first half of 2008 resulted in higher raw
    material and energy costs which enabled price increase
    initiatives across all business segments. During the second half
    of 2008, the US credit crisis accelerated the economic slowdown
    and its spread to other regions of the world. Despite the halt
    in demand, we were able to maintain the majority of our enacted
    price increases through the remainder of 2008. As a result,
    increased prices improved net sales by 8%. Favorable foreign
    currency impacts also had a positive impact on net sales of 3%.

Net sales declined 5% due to decreased volumes. Lower volumes
    were primarily a result of decreased demand stemming from the
    global economic downturn. As demand declined, particularly
    during the fourth quarter of 2008, our customers began
    destocking to reduce their inventory levels. In response, we
    aggressively managed our global production capacity to align
    with the current environment. Decreased volumes in our acetate
    flake and tow businesses were not significantly impacted by the
    economic downturn. Rather, decreased flake volumes were the
    result of our strategic decision to shift our flake production
    to our China ventures, which we account for as cost investments.

Gross profit declined as higher raw material, energy and freight
    costs more than offset increases in net sales during the period.
    The uncertain economic environment resulted in higher natural
    gas, ethylene, methanol and other commodity prices during the
    first nine months of the year. Our freight costs also increased,
    primarily due to increased rates driven by higher energy prices.
    Late in 2008, raw material and energy prices declined.

Other (charges) gains, net increased $50 million during
    2008 as compared to 2007:

Other charges increased in 2008 compared to 2007 and includes a
    long-lived asset impairment loss of $92 million in
    connection with the 2009 closure of our acetic acid and VAM
    production facility in Pardies, France, our VAM production unit
    in Cangrejera, Mexico and the potential closure of certain other
    facilities. This capacity reduction was necessitated by the
    significant change in the global economic environment and
    anticipated lower customer demand. Following the initial
    assessment of this capacity reduction, we shut down the
    Cangrejera VAM production unit in February 2009.

In addition, we recognized $23 million of long-lived asset
    impairment losses and $13 million of employee termination
    benefits in 2008 related to the shutdown of our Pampa, Texas
    facility.

During 2007, we fully impaired $6 million of goodwill
    related to our PVOH business.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
    $24 million during 2008 primarily due to business
    optimization and finance improvement initiatives.



Operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher
    other charges and selling, general and administrative costs. The
    absence of a $34 million gain on the sale of our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility during 2007 also contributed to lower
    operating profit in 2008 as compared to 2007.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased $28 million
    during 2008, primarily due to reduced earnings from our Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ affiliates resulting from higher raw
    material and energy costs and decreased demand. Our effective
    income tax rate for 2008 was 15% compared to 25% in 2007. The
    effective income tax rate decreased in 2008 due to: 1) a
    decrease in the valuation allowance, 2) tax credits
    generated on foreign jurisdictions and 3) the US tax impact
    of foreign operations.

The loss from discontinued operations of $90 million during
    2008 primarily relates to a legal settlement agreement we
    entered into during 2008. Under the settlement agreement, we
    agreed to pay $107 million to resolve certain legacy items.
    Because the legal proceeding related to sales by the polyester
    staple fibers business which Hoechst AG sold to KoSa, Inc. in
    1998, the impact of the settlement is reflected within
    discontinued operations in the current period. See the
    “Polyester Staple Antitrust Litigation” section in
    Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.

Our Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical
    polymers for application in automotive and electronics products,
    as well as other consumer and industrial applications. Together
    with our strategic affiliates, we are a leading participant in
    the global technical polymers industry. The primary products of
    Advanced Engineered Materials are polyacetal products
    (“POM”), polyphenylene sulfide (“PPS”), long
    fiber reinforced thermoplastics (“LFRT”), polybutylene
    terephthalate (“PBT”), polyethylene terephthalate
    (“PET”),
    GUR

®

and liquid crystal polymers (“LCP”). POM, PPS, LFRT,
    PBT and PET are used in a broad range of products including
    automotive components, electronics, appliances and industrial
    applications.
    GUR

®

is used in battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration
    equipment, coatings and medical devices. Primary end markets for
    LCP are electrical and electronics.

Net sales decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a
    result of lower sales volumes. Significant weakness in the
    global economy experienced during the first half of the year
    resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for



automotive, electrical and electronic products as well as for
    other industrial products. As a result, sales volumes dropped
    significantly across all product lines. During the second half
    of 2009, we experienced a continued increase in demand compared
    with the first half of the year as a result of programs like
    “Cash for Clunkers” in the United States during the
    third quarter of 2009 and a gradual recovery in the global
    economy during the fourth quarter of 2009. Demand for the first
    quarter of 2010 is expected to see continued improvement due to
    seasonality, with production being reduced in many areas in
    December due to the holidays, and continued improvement in the
    global economy.

Operating profit increased in 2009 as compared to 2008. Lower
    raw material and energy costs and decreased overall spending
    more than offset the decline in net sales. Decreased overall
    spending was the result of our fixed spending reduction efforts.
    Non-capital spending incurred on the relocation of our Ticona
    Kelsterbach plant was flat compared to 2008. For more
    information regarding the Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation,
    see Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax was down due to a
    drop in equity in net earnings of affiliates as compared to
    2008. Equity in net earnings of affiliates was lower in 2009
    primarily due to reduced earnings from our Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased demand and a
    biennial shutdown at one of our affiliate’s plants.

Our Consumer Specialties segment consists of our Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. Our Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow, which is used in
    the production of filter products. We also produce acetate
    flake, which is processed into acetate fiber in the form of a
    tow band. Our Nutrinova business produces and sells
    Sunett

®

,

    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceuticals
    industries.

Net sales decreased $71 million during 2009 when compared
    with 2008. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by
    decreased volume due to softening demand largely in tow with
    less significant decreases experienced in flake. Decreased
    volumes were primarily due to weakness in underlying demand
    resulting from the global economic downturn. The decrease in
    volume was partially offset by an increase in selling prices. A
    slightly unfavorable foreign currency impact also contributed to
    the decrease in net sales.

Operating profit increased from $190 million in 2008 to
    $231 million in 2009. Fixed cost reduction efforts,
    improved energy costs and a favorable currency impact on costs
    had a significant impact on the increase to operating profit.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax of
    $288 million increased from 2008 primarily due to the
    increase in operating profit and an increase in dividends from
    our China ventures of $9 million. Increased dividends are
    the result of increased volumes and higher prices, as well as
    efficiency improvements.

Our Industrial Specialties segment includes our Emulsions, PVOH
    and EVA Performance Polymers businesses. Our Emulsions business
    is a global leader which produces a broad range of products,
    specializing in vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions, and is a
    recognized authority on low volatile organic compounds
    (“VOC”), an environmentally-friendly technology. As a
    global leader, our PVOH business produced a broad portfolio of
    performance PVOH chemicals engineered to meet specific customer
    requirements. Our emulsions and PVOH products are used in a wide
    array of applications including paints and coatings, adhesives,
    construction, glass fiber, textiles and paper. EVA Performance
    Polymers offers a complete line of low-density polyethylene and
    specialty ethylene vinyl acetate resins and compounds. EVA
    Performance Polymers’ products are used in many
    applications including flexible packaging films, lamination film
    products, hot melt adhesives, medical tubing, automotive
    carpeting and solar cell encapsulation films.

In July 2009, we completed the sale of our PVOH business to
    Sekisui Chemical Co., Ltd. (“Sekisui”) for a net cash
    purchase price of $168 million. The transaction resulted in
    a gain on disposition of $34 million and includes long-term
    supply agreements between Sekisui and Celanese.

Net sales declined $432 million during 2009 compared to
    2008 primarily due to the sale of our PVOH business and lower
    demand due to the economic downturn. The decline in our
    emulsions volumes was concentrated in North America and Europe,
    offset partially by volume increases in Asia. EVA Performance
    Polymers’ volumes declined due to the impact of the force
    majeure event at our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant which is
    offset in other charges in our Other Activities segment. Repairs
    to the plant were completed at the end of the second quarter
    2009 and normal operations have resumed. Net sales were also
    down from prior year as a result of decreases in key raw
    material costs resulting in lower selling prices. Unfavorable
    currency impacts also contributed to the decline in net sales
    during the year.

Operating profit increased $42 million in 2009 compared to
    2008 as decreases in volume and selling prices were more than
    offset by lower raw material and energy costs and reduced
    overall spending. Reduced spending is attributable to our fixed
    spending reduction efforts, restructuring efficiencies and
    favorable foreign currency impacts on costs. Energy is favorable
    due to lower natural gas costs and lower usage resulting from a
    decline in volumes. Our EVA Performance Polymers business
    contributed to the increase in Other (charges) gains, net as a
    result of receiving $10 million in insurance recoveries in
    partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the force
    majeure event at our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant. The gain
    on the sale of our PVOH business of $34 million had a
    significant impact to the increase in operating profit.
    Deprecation and amortization also had a favorable impact on
    operating profit due to the PVOH divestiture and the shutdown of
    our Warrington, UK emulsions facility.

Our Acetyl Intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl
    products, including acetic acid, VAM, acetic anhydride and
    acetate esters. These products are generally used as starting
    materials for colorants, paints, adhesives, coatings, textiles,
    medicines and more. Other chemicals produced in this business
    segment are organic solvents and intermediates for
    pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical products. To meet the
    growing demand for acetic acid in China and ongoing site
    optimization efforts, we successfully expanded our acetic acid
    unit in Nanjing, China from 600,000 tons per reactor annually to
    1.2 million tons per reactor annually. Using new
    AOPlus

®


    capability, the acetic acid unit could be further expanded to
    1.5 million tons per reactor annually with only modest
    additional capital.

Net sales decreased 33% during 2009 as compared to 2008
    primarily due to lower selling prices across all regions and
    major product lines, lower volumes and unfavorable foreign
    currency impacts. Lower volumes were driven by a reduction in
    underlying demand in Europe and in the Americas, which was only
    partially offset by significant increases in demand in Asia.
    Lower pricing was driven by lower raw material and energy
    prices, which also negatively impacted our formula-based pricing
    arrangements for VAM in the US. There were a number of
    production issues in Asia among the major acetic acid producers
    (other than Celanese), which coupled with planned outages,
    caused periodic and short-term market tightness. In 2010, sales
    are expected to see increases as compared to the corresponding
    periods in the prior year as the global economy begins to slowly
    recover. Sales volumes for the first quarter of 2010 are
    expected to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2009 as
    expected improvements in demand in the US are partially offset
    by expected reductions in Asia due to seasonal demand reductions
    for the Chinese New Year.

Operating profit declined $214 million primarily as a
    result of lower prices across all regions and major product
    lines. Significantly lower realized pricing was partially offset
    by favorable raw material and energy prices, reduced spending
    due to the shutdown of our Pampa, Texas facility and other
    reductions in fixed spending. Depreciation and amortization
    expense declined primarily as a result of the long-lived asset
    impairment losses recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008
    related to our acetic acid and VAM production facility in
    Pardies, France, the closure of our VAM production unit in
    Cangrejera, Mexico in February 2009, together with lower
    depreciation expense resulting from the shutdown of our Pampa,
    Texas facility. Other charges negatively impacted our operating
    profit by increasing $13 million from prior year which
    relates primarily to the planned shutdown of our Pardies, France
    facility. Margins are expected to be lower in the first quarter
    of 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to
    increasing competition and expected increases in raw material
    costs.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax differs from
    operating profit primarily as a result of dividend income from
    our cost investment, National Methanol Co. (“Ibn
    Sina”). Dividend income from Ibn Sina declined to
    $41 million in 2009 as a result of lower earnings from
    declining margins for methanol and methyl tertiary-butyl ether
    (“MTBE”).



Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities, and our
    captive insurance companies.

Net sales remained flat in 2009 as compared to 2008. We do not
    expect third-party revenues from our captive insurance companies
    to increase significantly in the near future.

The operating loss for Other Activities increased from an
    operating loss of $138 million in 2008 to an operating loss
    of $160 million in 2009. The increase was primarily related
    to higher other charges. The increase in other charges was
    related to insurance retention costs as a result of our force
    majeure event at our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant which is
    offset in our Industrial Specialties segment and severance costs
    as a result of business optimization and finance improvement
    initiatives. The increase in other charges was partially offset
    by lower selling, general and administrative expenses primarily
    attributable to our fixed spending reduction efforts and
    restructuring efficiencies.

The loss from continuing operations before tax decreased
    $11 million in 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was
    primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from lower
    interest rates on our senior credit facilities and favorable
    currency impact.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ net sales increased 3%
    during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of
    implemented pricing increases combined with favorable foreign
    currency impacts. Increases in net sales were partially offset
    by lower volumes due to significant weakness in the US and
    European automotive and housing industries. Extended plant
    shutdowns enacted by major car manufacturers during the fourth
    quarter of 2008 contributed significantly to the volume decline.

Operating profit declined $101 million primarily due to
    higher raw material, freight and energy costs. Raw material
    costs increased on higher prices while freight costs increased
    as a result of increased freight rates and larger shipments to
    Asia. Raw material costs declined late in 2008 though at year
    end we held higher-cost inventories while inventory destocking
    continued. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and
    increased other charges also contributed to lower operating
    profit. Depreciation and amortization expense are higher in 2008
    due to the

start-up

of
    the
    GUR

®

and LFRT units in Asia. Other charges consist primarily of a
    $16 million long-lived asset impairment loss related to
    certain Advanced Engineered Materials’ facilities and
    $12 million related to the relocation of our Ticona plant
    in Kelsterbach. See Note 29 to the consolidated financial
    statements for more information on the Ticona Kelsterbach plant
    relocation.



Earnings from continuing operations before tax decreased due to
    decreased operating profit and decreased equity in net earnings
    of affiliates. Equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased
    $18 million during 2008, primarily due to reduced earnings
    from our Advanced Engineered Materials’ affiliates
    resulting from higher raw material and energy costs and
    decreased demand.

Consumer Specialties’ net sales increased 4% to
    $1,155 million during the year ended December 31, 2008
    driven primarily by pricing actions in our Acetate Products
    business and an additional month of sales from our APL
    acquisition, which was acquired on January 31, 2007, offset
    by lower volumes. Lower volumes are a direct result of our
    strategic decision to shift acetate flake production to our
    China ventures, which are accounted for as cost method
    investments. The full impact of this shift has been realized
    during 2008 and thus the resulting trend of diminishing volumes
    is not expected to continue. Lower flake volumes were partially
    offset by a 5% increase in tow volumes as we were able to
    capture a portion of the growth in global tow demand.

The increase in net sales due to higher sales prices during 2008
    was offset most significantly by higher energy costs, and to a
    lesser extent, higher raw material and freight costs. Operating
    profit, as compared to 2007, declined primarily due to the
    absence of a $22 million gain on the sale of our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility in 2007. Other charges during 2007
    includes $3 million of deferred compensation plan expenses
    and $5 million of other restructuring charges, offset by
    insurance recoveries of $5 million in partial satisfaction
    of the business interruption losses resulting from the temporary
    unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake,
    Texas facility.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax of
    $237 million increased from 2007 as increased dividends
    from our China ventures more than offset the decline in
    operating profit. Increased dividends are the result of
    increased volumes and higher prices, as well as efficiency
    improvements.

Industrial Specialties’ net sales increased by 4% during
    2008 as increased prices and favorable foreign currency impacts
    more than offset volume reductions. Pricing actions implemented
    by all business lines late in 2007 and during 2008 contributed
    to the increase in net sales. Volumes declined primarily on
    decreased demand across all regions due to the global economic
    downturn combined with the temporary shutdown of our EVA
    Performance Polymers plant late in 2008. The overall volume
    decline was partially offset by increased emulsions volumes at
    our Nanjing, China facility, which began operating late in 2008.

Increased net sales were more than offset by higher raw material
    and energy costs during 2008. The $19 million increase in
    operating profit was primarily due to lower other charges and
    the absence of the $7 million loss on the divestiture of
    our EVA Performance Polymers’ Films business in 2007.
    During 2007, we initiated a plan to simplify and optimize our
    Emulsions and PVOH businesses to focus on technology and
    innovation. Other charges during 2008 includes a charge of
    $3 million for employee termination benefits and
    accelerated depreciation related to this plan. Other charges
    during 2007 includes a charge of $14 million for employee
    termination benefits, $3 million for an impairment of
    long-lived assets and $5 million of accelerated
    depreciation expense for our shuttered United Kingdom plant
    related to this plan. Other charges in 2007 also include
    $6 million of goodwill impairment and receipt of
    $7 million in insurance recoveries in partial satisfaction
    of the business interruption losses resulting from the temporary
    unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake,
    Texas facility.

Depreciation and amortization






Acetyl Intermediates’ net sales increased by 7% during 2008
    primarily due to increased prices and favorable foreign currency
    impacts, partially offset by lower volumes. Our formula-based
    pricing arrangements benefited from higher ethylene and methanol
    costs during the first nine months of 2008. Market tightness in
    the Americas and favorable foreign currency impacts in Europe
    also contributed to the increase in net sales. Reduced volumes
    offset the increase in net sales as the slowdown of the global
    economy caused customers to slow production and diminish current
    inventory levels, particularly in Asia during the fourth
    quarter. Ethylene and methanol prices decreased during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 on slowed global demand.

Operating profit declined $307 million primarily as a
    result of higher ethylene, methanol and energy prices, increased
    other charges, increased depreciation and amortization and the
    absence of a $12 million gain on the sale of our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility in 2007. Other charges increased during
    2008 partially due to $76 million of long-lived asset
    impairment losses recognized in 2008 related to the closure of
    our acetic acid and VAM production facility in Pardies, France,
    our VAM production unit in Cangrejera, Mexico (which we shut
    down effective February 2009) and the potential shutdown of
    certain other facilities. Other charges in 2008 also includes
    $23 million of long-lived asset impairment losses and
    $13 million of severance and retention charges related to
    the shutdown of our Pampa, Texas facility. Also contributing to
    the increase was the absence of a one-time payment of
    $31 million received in 2007 in resolution of commercial
    disputes with a vendor and a $25 million decrease in
    insurance recoveries received in partial satisfaction of the
    losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the
    acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. Increased
    depreciation and amortization expense during 2008 is the result
    of accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of our
    Pampa, Texas facility and a full year of depreciation for our
    acetic acid plant in Nanjing, China, which started up in
    mid-2007.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax differs from
    operating profit primarily as a result of dividend income from
    our cost investment, National Methanol Co. (“Ibn
    Sina”). Increased dividend income of $41 million
    during 2008 had a positive impact on earnings from continuing
    operations before tax. Ibn Sina increased their dividends as a
    result of higher earnings from expanding margins for methanol
    and MTBE.

Other
    Activities

Net sales for Other Activities remained flat in 2008 as compared
    to 2007. We do not expect third-party revenues from our captive
    insurance companies to increase significantly in the near future.

The operating loss for Other Activities improved
    $90 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due to lower
    other charges, partially offset by higher selling, general and
    administrative expenses. Other charges decreased principally due
    to the release of reserves related to the Sorbates antitrust
    actions settlement of $8 million and the absence of
    $59 million of deferred compensation plan costs which were
    incurred during 2007. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased due to additional spending on business
    optimization and finance improvement initiatives during 2008.

The loss from continuing operations before tax decreased
    $346 million during 2008. The significant decrease was
    primarily due to the absence of $256 million of refinancing
    costs incurred in 2007 and the decrease in the operating loss
    discussed above.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from
    operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends
    from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, we
    have a $600 million revolving credit facility and
    $140 million available for borrowing under our
    credit-linked revolving facility to assist, if required, in
    meeting our working capital needs and other contractual
    obligations. In excess of 20 lenders participate in our
    revolving credit facility, each with a commitment of not more
    than 10% of the $600 million commitment.

While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service
    requirements over the next several years are significant, we
    continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our
    liquidity requirements, including debt service, in 2010. If our
    cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt
    service and other obligations, we may be required to use other
    means available to us such as increasing our borrowings,
    reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional
    capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
    There can be



no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash
    flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to
    maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit
    facilities.

As a result of the Pardies, France Project of Closure, we
    recorded exit costs of $89 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, which included $60 million in
    employee termination benefits, $17 million of contract
    termination costs, and $12 million of long-lived asset
    impairment losses to Other charges (gains), net. See
    Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information regarding Other Charges. In addition, we
    recorded $9 million of accelerated depreciation expense and
    $8 million of environmental remediation reserves for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 related to the shutdown of the
    Pardies, France facility. We may incur up to an additional
    $17 million in contingent employee termination benefits
    related to the Pardies, France Project of Closure. We expect
    that substantially all of the exit costs (except for accelerated
    depreciation of fixed assets) will result in future cash
    expenditures over a two-year period. The Pardies, France
    facility is included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment. Refer
    to the Acetyl Intermediates section of the MD&A for more
    detail.

On a stand-alone basis, Celanese Corporation has no material
    assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries and no
    independent external operations of our own. As such, we
    generally depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet
    our obligations under our preferred stock, our Series A
    common stock and our senior credit agreement.

Cash
    Flows

Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2009 were
    $1,254 million, which was an increase of $578 million
    from December 31, 2008. Cash and cash equivalents as of
    December 31, 2008 were $676 million, which was a
    decrease of $149 million from December 31, 2007. See
    below for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents
    from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 and the
    change in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2007
    to December 31, 2008.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased
    $10 million to a cash inflow of $596 million in 2009
    from a cash inflow of $586 million for the same period in
    2008. Operating cash flows were favorably impacted by less cash
    paid for interest, taxes, and legal settlements coupled with a
    favorable change in trade working capital which helped to offset
    lower operating performance.

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased
    $20 million to a cash inflow of $586 million in 2008
    from a cash inflow of $566 million for the same period in
    2007. Operating cash flows were favorably impacted by positive
    trade working capital changes ($202 million), lower cash
    taxes paid ($83 million) and the absence of adjustments to
    cash for discontinued operations. Adjustments to cash for
    discontinued operations of $84 million during 2007 related
    primarily to working capital changes of the oxo products and
    derivatives businesses and the shutdown of our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada methanol facility. Offsetting the increase in
    cash flows were an increase in net cash interest paid
    ($78 million), cash spent on legal settlements
    ($134 million) and decreased operating profit during the
    period.

Net Cash
    Provided by/Used in Investing Activities

Net cash from investing activities increased from a cash outflow
    of $201 million in 2008 to a cash inflow of
    $31 million in 2009. Net cash from investing activities
    increased primarily due to lower capital expenditures on
    property, plant and equipment, proceeds received from the sale
    of our PVOH business and increased deferred proceeds received on
    our Ticona Kelsterbach relocation. These cash inflows were
    offset slightly by in increase on our capital expenditures
    related to our Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation.

Net cash from investing activities decreased from a cash inflow
    of $143 million in 2007 to a cash outflow of
    $201 million in 2008. Net cash from investing activities
    decreased primarily due to cash spent in settlement of our cross
    currency swaps of $93 million (see Note 22 to the
    consolidated financial statements) and the absence of proceeds
    from the sale of our oxo products and derivatives businesses
    during 2007. These amounts were offset by net cash received on
    the sale of marketable securities ($111 million) and the
    excess of cash received from Fraport over amounts spent in
    connection with the Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation.



Our cash outflows for capital expenditures were
    $176 million, $274 million and $288 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, excluding amounts related to the relocation of our
    Ticona plant in Kelsterbach. Capital expenditures were primarily
    related to major replacements of equipment, capacity expansions,
    major investments to reduce future operating costs and
    environmental, health and safety initiatives. Cash outflows for
    capital expenditures are expected to be approximately
    $265 million in 2010, excluding amounts related to the
    relocation of our Ticona plant in Kelsterbach.

As of December 31, 2009, we have received
    €542 million of cash from Fraport in connection with
    the Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation. Per the terms of the
    Fraport agreement, we expect to receive an additional
    €110 million in 2011 subject to downward adjustments
    based on our readiness to close our operations at our
    Kelsterbach, Germany facility. We anticipate related cash
    outflows for capital expenditures in 2010 will be
    €200 million.

Net Cash
    Used in Financing Activities

Net cash for financing activities decreased from a cash outflow
    of $499 million in 2008 to a cash outflow of
    $112 million in 2009. The $387 million decrease in
    cash used in financing activities primarily related to cash
    outflows attributable to the repurchase of shares during 2008 of
    $378 million as compared to no shares repurchased during
    2009.

Net cash for financing activities increased to a cash outflow of
    $499 million in 2008 compared to a cash outflow of
    $714 million during 2007. The increase primarily relates to
    the absence of cash outflows attributable to the debt
    refinancing in 2007. Also contributing to the increase, cash
    spent to repurchase shares was $25 million less during 2008
    than during 2007. Decreased cash received for stock option
    exercises of $51 million partially offset the increase.

In addition, exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents
    increased to a favorable currency effect of $63 million in
    2009 compared to an unfavorable impact of $35 million in
    2008 and a favorable impact of $39 million in 2007.

Debt
    and Other Obligations

As of December 31, 2009, we had total debt of
    $3,501 million and cash and cash equivalents of
    $1,254 million, resulting in net debt of
    $2,247 million, a $610 million decrease from
    December 31, 2008. Increased cash of $578 million and
    net cash paydowns on debt of $89 million were partially
    offset by new capital lease obligations of $38 million and
    unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $24 million.

Senior
    Credit Facilities

Our senior credit agreement consists of $2,280 million of
    US dollar-denominated and €400 million of
    Euro-denominated term loans due 2014, a $600 million
    revolving credit facility terminating in 2013 and a
    $228 million credit-linked revolving facility terminating
    in 2014. As of December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding
    borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
    credit facility; accordingly, $600 million remained
    available for borrowing. As of December 31, 2009, there
    were $88 million of letters of credit issued under the
    credit-linked revolving facility and $140 million remained
    available for borrowing. Our senior credit agreement requires us
    to not exceed a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio
    if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility. The first lien senior secured leverage ratio is
    calculated as the ratio of consolidated first lien senior
    secured debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization, subject to adjustments identified in the
    credit agreement. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information regarding our senior
    credit facilities.

On June 30, 2009, we entered into an amendment to the
    senior credit agreement. The amendment reduced the amount
    available under the revolving credit facility from
    $650 million to $600 million and increased the first
    lien senior secured leverage ratio covenant that is applicable
    when any amount is outstanding under the revolving credit
    portion of the senior credit agreement. Prior to giving effect
    to the amendment, the maximum first lien senior



secured leverage ratio was 3.90 to 1.00. As amended, the maximum
    senior secured leverage ratio for the following trailing
    four-quarter periods is as follows:

First Lien Senior Secured

Leverage Ratio

December 31, 2009

5.25 to 1.00

March 31, 2010

4.75 to 1.00

June 30, 2010

4.25 to 1.00

September 30, 2010

4.25 to 1.00

December 31, 2010 and thereafter

3.90 to 1.00

As a condition to borrowing funds or requesting that letters of
    credit be issued under the revolving credit facility, our first
    lien senior secured leverage ratio (as calculated as of the last
    day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial
    statements have been delivered under the revolving facility)
    cannot exceed a certain threshold as specified above. Further,
    our first lien senior secured leverage ratio must be maintained
    at or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding
    under the revolving credit facility. The first lien senior
    secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of
    consolidated first lien senior secured debt to earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to
    adjustment identified in the credit agreement.

Based on the estimated first lien senior secured leverage ratio
    for the trailing four quarters at December 31, 2009, our
    borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility is
    $600 million. As of the quarter ended December 31,
    2009, we estimate our first lien senior secured leverage ratio
    to be 3.39 to 1.00 (which would be 4.11 to 1.00 were the
    revolving credit facility fully drawn). The maximum first lien
    senior secured leverage ratio under the revolving credit
    facility for such quarter is 5.25 to 1.00. Our availability in
    future periods will be based on the first lien senior secured
    leverage ratio applicable to the future periods.

Our senior credit agreement also contains a number of
    restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries, including, but not
    limited to, restrictions on their ability to incur indebtedness;
    grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay
    dividends or make other restricted payments; make investments;
    prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in transactions
    with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions or
    certain hedge transactions; or engage in other businesses. The
    senior credit agreement also contains a number of affirmative
    covenants and events of default, including a cross default to
    other debt of certain of our subsidiaries in an aggregate amount
    equal to more than $40 million and the occurrence of a
    change of control. Failure to comply with these covenants, or
    the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in
    acceleration of the loans and other financial obligations under
    our senior credit agreement.

Commitments
    Relating to Share Capital

Our Board of Directors adopted a policy of declaring, subject to
    legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share
    of our Series A common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per
    share unless our Board of Directors in its sole discretion
    determines otherwise. For the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid $23 million, $24 million
    and $25 million, respectively, in cash dividends on our
    Series A common stock. On January 5, 2010, we declared
    a $6 million cash dividend which was paid on
    February 1, 2010.

Holders of our 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred stock
    (“Preferred Stock”) are entitled to receive, when, as
    and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally
    available, quarterly cash dividends at the rate of 4.25% per
    annum, or $0.265625 per share of liquidation preference.
    Dividends on the Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of
    initial issuance. The Preferred Stock is convertible, at the
    option of the holder, at any time into 1.2600 shares of our
    Series A common stock, subject to adjustments, per $25.00
    liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock. For the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid
    $10 million annually of cash dividends on our Preferred
    Stock. On January 5, 2010, we declared a $3 million
    cash dividend on our Preferred Stock, which was paid on
    February 1, 2010.

On February 1, 2010, we announced we would elect to redeem
    all of our outstanding Preferred Stock on February 22,
    2010. Holders of the Preferred Stock also have the right to
    convert their shares at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New
    York City time, on February 19, 2010, the business day
    immediately preceding the February 22,



2010 redemption date. Considering the redemption of our
    Preferred Stock, we will pay cash dividends on our Preferred
    Stock of $3 million in 2010.

Contractual
    Guarantees and Commitments

As of December 31, 2009, we have current standby letters of
    credit of $88 million and bank guarantees of
    $12 million outstanding which are irrevocable obligations
    of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the
    event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance
    with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote
    that material payments will be required under these agreements.

Other
    Obligations

Deferred Compensation.

In April 2007, certain
    participants in our 2004 deferred compensation plan elected to
    participate in a revised program, which includes both cash
    awards and restricted stock units. Under the revised cash
    program, participants relinquished their cash awards of up to
    $30 million that would have contingently accrued from



2007-2009

under the original plan. Based on current participation in the
    revised cash program, we expensed $10 million during the
    year ended December 31, 2009. The revised cash awards vest
    December 31, 2010.

In December 2008, we granted time-vesting cash awards of
    $22 million with Celanese’s executive officers and
    certain other key employees. Each award of cash vests 30% on
    October 14, 2009, 30% on October 14, 2010 and 40% on
    October 14, 2011. In its sole discretion, the compensation
    committee of the Board of Directors may at any time convert all
    or a portion of the cash award to an award of time-vesting
    restricted stock units. The liability cash awards are being
    accrued and expensed over the term of the agreements. During the
    year ended December 31, 2009, less than $1 million was
    paid to participants who left the Company and $6 million
    was paid in October 2009 to active employees representing 30% of
    the remaining outstanding award.

Pension and Other Postretirement Obligations.

Our
    contributions for pension and postretirement benefits are
    preliminarily estimated to be $46 million and
    $27 million, respectively, in 2010.

Domination Agreement.

The domination and profit and
    loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”)
    was approved at the Celanese GmbH, formerly known as Celanese
    AG, extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on July 31,
    2004. The Domination Agreement between Celanese GmbH and the
    Purchaser became effective on October 1, 2004 and was
    terminated effective December 31, 2009 by the Purchaser in
    the ordinary course of business. Our subsidiaries, Celanese
    International Holdings Luxembourg S.à r.l.
    (“CIH”), formerly Celanese Caylux Holdings Luxembourg
    S.C.A., and Celanese US, have each agreed to provide the
    Purchaser with financing to strengthen the Purchaser’s
    ability to fulfill its obligations under, or in connection with,
    the Domination Agreement and to ensure that the Purchaser will
    perform all of its obligations under, or in connection with, the
    Domination Agreement when such obligations become due,
    including, without limitation, the obligation to compensate
    Celanese GmbH for any statutory annual loss incurred by Celanese
    GmbH during the term of the Domination Agreement. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under such guarantees
    or other security to the Purchaser, we may not have sufficient
    funds for payments on our indebtedness when due. We have not had
    to compensate Celanese GmbH for an annual loss for any period
    during which the Domination Agreement has been in effect. Due to
    the termination of the Domination Agreement there will be no
    obligation to compensate for any losses incurred after
    December 31, 2009.

Purchases
    of Treasury Stock

In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $400 million of our Series A
    common stock. This authorization was increased to
    $500 million in October 2008. The authorization gives
    management discretion in determining the conditions under which
    shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have
    an expiration date. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, we did not repurchase any shares of our Series A
    common stock in connection with this authorization. We have the
    ability to repurchase an additional $122 million of
    Series A common stock based on the Board of Director’s
    authorization of $500 million.

These purchases will reduce the number of shares outstanding and
    the repurchased shares may be used by us for compensation
    programs utilizing our stock and other corporate purposes. We
    account for treasury stock using the cost method and include
    treasury stock as a component of Shareholders’ equity.

Plumbing
    Actions

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims
    incidental to the normal conduct of our business. As of
    December 31, 2009 there were reserves of $55 million
    related to plumbing action litigation. Although it is impossible
    at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of
    these matters, we believe, based on the advice of legal counsel,
    that adequate provisions have been made and that the ultimate
    outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, but could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting
    period.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection
    and application of significant accounting policies. The
    preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
    consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
    revenues, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
    However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely
    events or circumstances that would result in materially
    different results.

We believe the following accounting polices and estimates are
    critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present
    in the current economic environment. These matters, and the
    judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential
    to understanding our reported and future operating results. See
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more
    comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies.

• Recoverability
    of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

We test for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level.
    Our reporting units are either our operating business segments
    or one level below our operating business segments where
    discrete financial information is available for our reporting
    units and operating results are regularly reviewed by business
    segment management. Our business units have been designated as
    our reporting units based on business segment management’s
    review of and reliance on the business unit financial
    information and include Advanced Engineered Materials, Acetate
    Products, Nutrinova, Emulsions, Celanese EVA Performance
    Polymers (formerly AT Plastics) and Acetyl Intermediates
    businesses. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value
    of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June
    30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully
    recoverable. Recoverability of goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured using a
    discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates
    commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit.
    Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in
    impairment testing in the absence of available transactional
    market evidence to determine the fair value.

The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation
    model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow
    projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth
    rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and
    susceptible to change as they require significant management
    judgment. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted
    average cost of capital (“WACC”). The WACC considers
    market and industry data as well as Company-specific risk
    factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate
    discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each
    reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would
    expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational
    management, considering industry and Company-specific historical
    and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow
    projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate
    determination follows common methodology of capturing the
    present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last
    projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term
    growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the
    current carrying value, impairment of the reporting unit may
    exist. If the recoverability test indicates potential
    impairment, we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for
    the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is
    determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in
    a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill
    exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting
    unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill
    assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of
    the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the
    carrying value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying
    value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate
    certain



long-lived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the
    reporting unit may require additional impairment testing.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing
    the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair
    value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The relief
    from royalty method estimates the Company’s theoretical
    royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key
    assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty
    rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates.
    Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales
    projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible
    to change as they require significant management judgment.
    Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the
    WACC considering any differences in Company-specific risk
    factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are
    periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants.
    Operational management, considering industry and
    Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth
    rates and sales projections associated with each
    indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal value rate
    determination follows common methodology of capturing the
    present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last
    projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term
    growth rates.

For all significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded the
    carrying value of the asset by a substantial margin at the date
    of the most recent impairment test. Our methodology for
    determining impairment for both goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets was consistent with that used in the prior
    year.

Recoverability of Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets

We assess the recoverability of long-lived and amortizable
    intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples
    of a change in events or circumstances include, but are not
    limited to, a decrease in the market price of the asset, a
    history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is being used. To assess the recoverability of long-lived
    and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount
    of the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted
    cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.
    Long-lived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for
    recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest
    level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent
    of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If such
    assets are considered impaired, the impairment recognized is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the fair value of the asset.

The development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections
    require management projections related to sales and
    profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset.
    Projections of sales and profitability trends are the
    assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they
    require significant management judgment. These projections are
    consistent with projections we use to manage our operations
    internally. When impairment is indicated, a discounted cash flow
    valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the
    reporting unit level, incorporating discount rates commensurate
    with risks associated with each asset, is used to determine the
    fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment. We
    believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market
    participant would have used in calculating fair value.

Valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible, amortizable intangible and
    long-lived assets for impairment were consistent with prior
    periods. We periodically engage third-party valuation
    consultants to assist us with this process. Specific assumptions
    discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider
    current industry and Company-specific risk factors from the
    perspective of a market participant. The current business
    environment is subject to evolving market conditions and
    requires significant management judgment to interpret the
    potential impact to the Company’s assumptions. To the
    extent that changes in the current business environment result
    in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may occur
    in future periods.

• Income
    Taxes

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable
    income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not that some



portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
    In forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred
    tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax
    attribute carryforwards, we give weight to positive and negative
    evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can
    be objectively verified. We attach the most weight to historical
    earnings due to its verifiable nature. Weight is attached to tax
    planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible
    and implementable without significant obstacles. Less weight is
    attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective
    nature, and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary
    differences is given little weight unless the reversal of
    taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide. Valuation
    allowances have been established primarily on net operating loss
    carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the US,
    Luxembourg, France, Spain, China, the United Kingdom and Canada.
    We have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our
    valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive
    versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction
    basis. In 2009, based on cumulative profitability, the Company
    concluded that the US valuation allowance should be reversed
    except for a portion related to certain federal and state net
    operating loss carryforwards that are not likely to be realized.

We record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that
    may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax
    authorities. We recognize tax benefits when it is more likely
    than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical
    merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.
    Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are
    measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest
    amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
    realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of
    judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that
    position evaluated in light of all available evidence.

The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition
    and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to
    various assumptions and management judgment. If actual results
    differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or
    maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets,
    the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally
    impact earnings or Other comprehensive income depending on the
    nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the
    positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject
    to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in
    future taxes, interest and penalties.

In December 2009, Mexico enacted the 2010 Mexican Tax Reform
    Bill (“Tax Reform Bill”) to be effective
    January 1, 2010. Under this new legislation, the corporate
    income tax rate will be temporarily increased from 28% to 30%
    for 2010 through 2012, then reduced to 29% in 2013, and finally
    reduced back to 28% in 2014 and future years. The Tax Reform
    Bill as enacted accelerates this recapture period from
    10 years to 5 years and effectively requires payment
    of taxes even if no benefit was obtained through the tax
    consolidation regime. Finally, significant modifications were
    also made to the rules for income taxes previously deferred on
    intercompany dividends, as well as to income taxes related to
    differences between consolidated and individual Mexican tax
    earnings and profits. The estimated income tax impact to the
    Company of this new legislation at December 31, 2009 is
    $73 million, payable $12 million in 2010,
    $14 million in 2012, $12 million in 2013 and
    $35 million in 2014 and thereafter. There is an expectation
    that Mexico may publish technical corrections to certain aspects
    of the Tax Reform Bill in 2010 that could significantly reduce
    the amounts due from the Company as described above. However,
    there is no assurance that Mexico will in fact publish such
    corrections, nor is it clear what impact any corrections
    published will have on the Company’s actual liability under
    the new law. Although any ultimate outcome is uncertain, we
    strongly contend the new legislation is unconstitutional and we
    will contest its validity and effective date through proper
    channels.

•

Benefit Obligations

We have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering
    substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements.
    With respect to its US qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    minimum funding requirements are determined by the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006 based on years of service

and/or

compensation. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of
    the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These
    assumptions include the weighted average discount rate,
    compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan
    assets and trends in health care costs. In addition to the above
    mentioned assumptions, actuarial consultants use factors such as
    withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit
    obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially
    from actual results due to changing market and economic
    conditions, higher or lower



withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of
    participants. These differences may result in a significant
    impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future
    periods.

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements
    related to pension and other postretirement benefits are
    determined on an actuarial basis. A significant assumption used
    in determining our pension expense is the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. As of December 31, 2009, we
    assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of
    8.5% for the US defined benefit pension plans, which represent
    approximately 83% and 85% of our pension plan assets and
    liabilities, respectively. On average, the actual return on the
    US qualified defined pension plans’ assets over the
    long-term (15 to 20 years) has exceeded 8.5%.

We estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected
    long-term rate of return for the US qualified defined benefit
    pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated
    $5 million in 2009. Another estimate that affects our
    pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount
    rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and
    other postretirement benefit plan obligations. At the end of
    each year, we determine the appropriate discount rate, used to
    determine the present value of future cash flows currently
    expected to be required to settle the pension and other
    postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is
    generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate
    fixed-income securities. As of December 31, 2009, we
    decreased the discount rate to 5.90% from 6.50% as of
    December 31, 2008 for the US plans. We estimate that a
    50 basis point decline in our discount rate will increase
    our annual pension expenses by an estimated $12 million,
    and increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $151 million for our US pension plans. In addition, the
    same basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase
    our annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than
    $1 million and $9 million respectively, for our US
    postretirement medical plans. We estimate that a 50 basis
    point decline in the discount rate for the non-US pension and
    postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other
    postretirement benefit annual expenses by approximately
    $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and
    will increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $32 million and $2 million, respectively.

Other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life
    insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service
    requirements. The key determinants of the accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) are the
    discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate. The healthcare
    cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts
    of APBO and related expense. For example, increasing or
    decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage
    point in each year would result in the APBO as of
    December 31, 2009 changing by approximately $4 million
    and $(3) million, respectively. Additionally, increasing or
    decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage
    point in each year would result in the 2009 postretirement
    benefit cost changing by less than $1 million.

Pension assumptions are reviewed annually on a plan and
    country-specific basis by third-party actuaries and senior
    management. Such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to
    reflect changes in market rates and outlook. We determine the
    long-term expected rate of return on plan assets by considering
    the current target asset allocation, as well as the historical
    and expected rates of return on various asset categories in
    which the plans are invested. A single long-term expected rate
    of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the
    weighted average of the target asset allocation and the
    long-term expected rate of return assumptions for each asset
    category within each plan.

Differences between actual rates of return of plan assets and
    the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets are
    generally not recognized in pension expense in the year that the
    difference occurs. These differences are deferred and amortized
    into pension expense over the average remaining future service
    of employees. We apply the long-term expected rate of return on
    plan assets to a market-related value of plan assets to
    stabilize variability in the plan asset values.

• Accounting
    for Commitments and Contingencies

We are subject to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits,
    claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of
    our business, relating to and including product liability,
    patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices, release of chemicals
    into the environment and employment matters, which are handled
    and defended in the ordinary course of business. We routinely
    assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
    these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably
    estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by
    us after considering a broad range of information including:



notifications, demands, settlements which have been received
    from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates
    performed by independent consultants and outside counsel,
    available facts, identification of other potentially responsible
    parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior
    experience. With respect to environmental liabilities, it is our
    policy to accrue through fifteen years, unless we have
    government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen
    years. A determination of the amount of loss contingency
    required, if any, is assessed in accordance with FASB Accounting
    Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic 450,

Contingencies,

and recorded if probable and estimable
    after careful analysis of each individual matter. The required
    reserves may change in the future due to new developments in
    each matter and as additional information becomes available.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
    Risks

Our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
    Exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety
    of techniques, including use of derivatives. We have in place
    policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates,
    interest rates and commodity prices as described below.
    Contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under
    FASB ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

(“FASB
    ASC Topic 815”).

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate
    risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of
    borrowing. To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our
    variable rate debt, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to
    convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate
    obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are designated
    as cash flow hedges.

In March 2007, in anticipation of the April 2007 debt
    refinancing, we entered into various US dollar and Euro interest
    rate swap agreements, which became effective on April 2,
    2007, with notional amounts of $1.6 billion and
    €150 million, respectively. The notional amount of the
    $1.6 billion US dollar interest rate swaps decreased by
    $400 million effective January 2, 2008 and decreased
    by another $200 million effective January 2, 2009. To
    offset the declines, we entered into US dollar interest rate
    swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million which
    became effective on January 2, 2008 and an additional US
    dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of
    $200 million which became effective April 2, 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, we had $2.2 billion,
    €440 million and CNY 1.4 billion of variable rate
    debt, of which $1.6 billion and €150 million is
    hedged with interest rate swaps, which leaves $643 million,
    €290 million and CNY 1.4 billion of variable rate
    debt subject to interest rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1%
    increase in interest rates would increase annual interest
    expense by approximately $13 million.

See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our interest rate risk management and the
    related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

The primary business objective of this hedging program is to
    maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign
    currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from
    exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are
    minimized. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and
    to conduct operations either within functional currencies or
    using the protection of hedge strategies. Accordingly, we enter
    into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our
    exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. From time to time we
    may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted
    transactions. Forward contracts are not designated as hedges
    under FASB ASC Topic 815.

The following table indicates the total US dollar equivalents of
    net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign
    exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency. All of the
    contracts included in the table below will



have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying
    payables, receivables, intercompany loans or other assets or
    liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement.

Additionally, a portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar,
    principally the Euro. Fluctuations in the value of these
    currencies against the US dollar, particularly the value of the
    Euro, can have a direct and material impact on the business and
    financial results. For example, a decline in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar results in a decline in the US dollar
    value of our sales and earnings denominated in Euros due to
    translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar would result in an opposite effect.

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
    a foreign operation, we entered into cross currency swaps with
    certain financial institutions in 2004. The cross currency swaps
    and the Euro-denominated portion of the senior term loan were
    designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign
    operation. We dedesignated the net investment hedge due to the
    debt refinancing in April 2007 and redesignated the cross
    currency swaps and new senior Euro term loan in July 2007. As a
    result, we recorded $26 million of

mark-to-market

losses related to the cross currency swaps and the new senior
    Euro term loan during this period.

Under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, we paid
    approximately €13 million in interest and received
    approximately $16 million in interest on June 15 and
    December 15 of each year. The fair value of the net obligation
    under the cross currency swaps was included in current Other
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of
    December 31, 2007. Upon maturity of the cross currency swap
    arrangements in June 2008, we owed €276 million
    ($426 million) and were owed $333 million. In
    settlement of the obligation, we paid $93 million (net of
    interest of $3 million) in June 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we dedesignated
    €385 million of the €400 million
    euro-denominated portion of the term loan, previously designated
    as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation. The
    remaining €15 million Euro-denominated portion of the
    term loan was dedesignated as a hedge of a net investment of a
    foreign operation in June 2009. Prior to these dedesignations,
    we had been using external derivative contracts to offset
    foreign currency exposures on certain intercompany loans. As a
    result of the dedesignations, the foreign currency exposure
    created by the Euro-denominated term loan is expected to offset
    the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans,
    decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and
    reducing our exposure to external counterparties.

See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and
    the related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Commodity
    Risk Management

We have exposure to the prices of commodities in our procurement
    of certain raw materials. We manage our exposure primarily
    through the use of long-term supply agreements and derivative
    instruments. We regularly assess



our practice of purchasing a portion of our commodity
    requirements forward and utilization of other raw material
    hedging instruments, in addition to forward purchase contracts,
    in accordance with changes in market conditions. Forward
    purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally
    settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity. For
    qualifying contracts, we have elected to apply the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception of FASB ASC Topic 815, as
    it was probable at the inception and throughout the term of the
    contract that they would not settle net and would result in
    physical delivery. As such, realized gains and losses on these
    contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the
    settlement of the contract.

In addition, we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to
    hedge a component of a raw material or energy source. Typically,
    these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the
    Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
    our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable
    assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are
    made in accordance with management authorization; and providing
    reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
    disposition of company assets that could have a material effect
    on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting is not intended to
    provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our
    consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2009. KPMG LLP has audited
    this assessment of our internal control over financial
    reporting; their report is included below.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying report of management on internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Celanese Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 12,
    2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009.
    These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 12, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Staff Position No. 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets

(included in FASB Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) Subtopic

715-20,

Defined Benefit Plans

), during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

As discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted FASB Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(included in FASB ASC Subtopic

820-10,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

), during the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

As discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(included in
    FASB ASC Subtopic

    contracts and agreements relative to a number of topics,
    including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, supply
    agreements, product sales and other arrangements. The Company
    endeavors to describe those contracts or agreements that are
    material to its business, results of operations or financial
    position. The Company may also describe some arrangements that
    are not material but which the Company believes investors may
    have an interest in or which may have been subject to a

Form 8-K

filing. Investors should not assume the Company has described
    all contracts and agreements relative to the Company’s
    business in this Annual Report.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

•
    Consolidation principles

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with US GAAP for all periods presented and include
    the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries
    over which the Company exercises control. All significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

•
    Estimates and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
    the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated charges
    during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to
    impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived
    assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and
    other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other
    postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations,
    environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.



•
    Cash and cash equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered cash equivalents.

•
    Inventories

Inventories, including stores and supplies, are stated at the
    lower of cost or market. Cost for inventories is determined
    using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost includes raw
    materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost for
    stores and supplies is primarily determined by the average cost
    method.

•
    Investments in marketable securities

The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity
    securities as

“available-for-sale”

and reports those investments at their fair market values in the
    consolidated balance sheets as Marketable Securities, at fair
    value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the related tax effect
    on

available-for-sale

securities, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
    component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    until realized. The cost of securities sold is determined by
    using the specific identification method.

A decline in the market value of any

available-for-sale

security below cost that is deemed to be

other-than-temporary

results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The
    impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the
    security is established. To determine whether impairment is

other-than-temporary,

the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to
    hold the investment until a market price recovery and evidence
    indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs
    evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment
    includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and
    duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year
    end and forecasted performance of the investee.

•
    Investments in affiliates

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic
    323,

Investments – Equity Method and Joint
    Ventures

, stipulates that the equity method should be used
    to account for investments whereby an investor has “the
    ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
    financial policies of an investee”, but does not exercise
    control. FASB ASC Topic 323 generally considers an investor to
    have the ability to exercise significant influence when it owns
    20% or more of the voting stock of an investee. FASB ASC Topic
    323 lists circumstances under which, despite 20% ownership, an
    investor may not be able to exercise significant influence.
    Certain investments where the Company owns greater than a 20%
    ownership and cannot exercise significant influence or control
    are accounted for under the cost method (Note 8).

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    its investments whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline.
    A loss in value of an equity-method or cost-method investment
    which is other than a temporary decline will be recognized as
    the difference between the carrying amount of the investment and
    its fair value.

The Company’s estimates of fair value are determined based
    on a discounted cash flow model. The Company periodically
    engages third-party valuation consultants to assist with this
    process.

•
    Property, plant and equipment, net

Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings, machinery and
    equipment, including capitalized interest, and property under
    capital lease agreements, are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. The Company records depreciation and amortization
    in its consolidated statements of operations as either Cost of
    sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses consistent
    with the utilization of the underlying assets. Depreciation is
    calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated
    useful lives of depreciable assets:

Land Improvements

20 years

Buildings and improvements

30 years

Machinery and Equipment

20 years



Leasehold improvements are amortized over ten years or the
    remaining life of the respective lease, whichever is shorter.

Accelerated depreciation is recorded when the estimated useful
    life is shortened. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs,
    including costs for planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not
    extend the useful life of the asset are charged to earnings as
    incurred. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and
    depreciation accounts until sold or otherwise disposed. In the
    case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed
    from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from
    disposal, are included in earnings.

The Company also leases property, plant and equipment under
    operating and capital leases. Rent expense for operating leases,
    which may have escalating rentals or rent holidays over the term
    of the lease, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
    lease term. Amortization of capital lease assets is included as
    a component of depreciation expense.

Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their
    fair values and depreciated over the assets’ remaining
    useful lives or the Company’s policy lives, whichever is
    shorter.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount
    of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would
    be assessed when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from
    the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than
    the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have
    identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other
    asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the
    excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair
    value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or
    independent appraisals, as appropriate. Impairment losses are
    recorded in depreciation expense or Other (charges) gains, net
    depending on the facts and circumstances.

•
    Goodwill and other intangible assets

Trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangible assets
    and other intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The
    excess of the purchase price over fair value of net identifiable
    assets and liabilities of an acquired business
    (“goodwill”) and other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment, at
    least annually. The Company tests for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment during the third
    quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill
    of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability
    is measured at the reporting unit level based on the provisions
    of FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles — Goodwill and
    Other

. The Company’s estimates of fair value are
    determined based on a discounted cash flow model. The Company
    periodically engages third-party valuation consultants to assist
    with this process. Impairment losses are recorded in other
    operating expense or Other (charges) gains, net depending on the
    facts and circumstances.

The Company assesses recoverability of other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the indefinite-lived intangible asset may not be fully
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset over its
    fair value. Any excess of the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value is
    recognized as an impairment loss. The Company’s estimates
    of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow
    model. The Company periodically engages third-party valuation
    consultants to assist with this process. Impairment losses are
    recorded in other operating expense or Other (charges) gains,
    net depending on the facts and circumstances.

The Company assesses the recoverability of finite-lived
    intangible assets in the same manner as for property, plant and
    equipment as described above. Impairment losses are recorded in
    amortization expense or Other (charges) gains, net depending on
    the facts and circumstances.



•
    Financial instruments

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FASB ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“FASB ASC Topic 820”) for financial assets and
    liabilities. On January 1, 2009, the Company applied the
    provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 for non-recurring fair value
    measurements of non-financial assets and liabilities, such as
    goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, property, plant
    and equipment and asset retirement obligations. The adoptions of
    FASB ASC Topic 820 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. FASB ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, and increases
    disclosures surrounding fair value calculations.

The Company manages its exposures to currency exchange rates,
    interest rates and commodity prices through a risk management
    program that includes the use of derivative financial
    instruments (Note 22). The Company does not use derivative
    financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The fair
    value of all derivative instruments is recorded as assets or
    liabilities at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value
    of these instruments are reported in income or Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net, depending on the use of the
    derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

(“FASB ASC Topic 815”).

Gains and losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash
    flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net, to the extent the hedges are effective,
    until the underlying transactions are recognized in income. To
    the extent effective, gains and losses on derivative and
    non-derivative instruments used as hedges of the Company’s
    net investment in foreign operations are recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), net as part of the foreign
    currency translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of
    cash flow hedges and hedges of net investment in foreign
    operations, if any, are recognized in income immediately.
    Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked to
    market at the end of each accounting period with the change in
    fair value recorded in income.

•
    Concentrations of credit risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment
    by customers and counterparties. The creditworthiness of
    customers and counterparties is subject to continuing review,
    including the use of master netting agreements, where the
    Company deems appropriate. The Company minimizes concentrations
    of credit risk through its global orientation in diverse
    businesses with a large number of diverse customers and
    suppliers. In addition, credit risks arising from derivative
    instruments is not significant because the counterparties to
    these contracts are primarily major international financial
    institutions and, to a lesser extent, major chemical companies.
    Where appropriate, the Company has diversified its selection of
    counterparties. Generally, collateral is not required from
    customers and counterparties and allowances are provided for
    specific risks inherent in receivables.

•
    Deferred financing costs

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred to obtain debt
    financings and amortizes these costs using a method that
    approximates the effective interest rate method over the terms
    of the related debt. Upon the extinguishment of the related
    debt, any unamortized capitalized debt financing costs are
    immediately expensed.

•
    Environmental liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical
    products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the
    production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling,
    processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials.
    The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating
    to environmental matters if available information indicates that
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of
    the site, the Company accrues through fifteen years, unless the
    Company has government orders or other agreements that extend
    beyond fifteen years. If the event of loss is neither probable
    nor reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible, the
    Company provides appropriate disclosure in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements if the contingency is
    considered material. The Company estimates environmental
    liabilities on a

case-by-case

basis using



the most current status of available facts, existing technology,
    presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in
    remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of environmental
    costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their
    receipt is deemed probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated
    site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of
    the following types of costs: site investigation and testing
    costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water
    contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation
    monitoring costs. These reserves do not take into account any
    claims or recoveries from insurance. There are no pending
    insurance claims for any environmental liability that are
    expected to be material. The measurement of environmental
    liabilities is based on the Company’s periodic estimate of
    what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the
    remediation effort. The Company utilizes third parties to assist
    in the management and development of cost estimates for its
    sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors
    affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the
    consolidated financial statements in the period in which they
    occur (Note 16).

•
    Legal fees

The Company accrues for legal fees related to loss contingency
    matters when the costs associated with defending these matters
    can be reasonably estimated and are probable of occurring. All
    other legal fees are expensed as incurred.

•
    Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have
    been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment of products, and provided that four basic criteria are
    met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and
    (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Should changes in
    conditions cause the Company to determine revenue recognition
    criteria are not met for certain transactions, revenue
    recognition would be delayed until such time that the
    transactions become realizable and fully earned. Payments
    received in advance of meeting the above revenue recognition
    criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.

•
    Research and development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense
    in the period in which they are incurred.

•
    Insurance loss reserves

The Company has two wholly owned insurance companies (the
    “Captives”) that are used as a form of self insurance
    for property, liability and workers compensation risks. One of
    the Captives also insures certain third-party risks. The
    liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated
    risk of loss which is based on management estimates and
    actuarial valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the
    portion of the third-party premiums written applicable to the
    unexpired terms of the policies in-force. Liabilities are
    recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been
    developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and the
    Company can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition,
    liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure
    on both known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the
    liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly. It is possible
    that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded
    liabilities. Premiums written are recognized as revenue based on
    the terms of the policies. Capitalization of the Captives is
    determined by regulatory guidelines.

•
    Reinsurance receivables

The Captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their
    risk of loss. The reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the
    Captives from their obligations to policyholders. Failure of the
    reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to
    the Captives. The Captives evaluate the financial condition of
    their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to
    minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
    insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed
    non-collectible.



•
    Income taxes

The provision for income taxes has been determined using the
    asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
    Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
    effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
    amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and
    tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these
    temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are
    expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or
    the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and
    laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the
    balance sheet date.

The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized.

The Company considers many factors when evaluating and
    estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require
    periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate
    actual outcomes. Tax positions are recognized only when it is
    more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on
    technical merits, that the positions will be sustained upon
    examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
    threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as
    the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax
    position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts
    and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all
    available evidence.

    Functional and reporting currencies

For the Company’s international operations where the
    functional currency is other than the US dollar, assets and
    liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates,
    while the statement of operations amounts are translated using
    the average exchange rates for the respective period.
    Differences arising from the translation of assets and
    liabilities in comparison with the translation of the previous
    periods or from initial recognition during the period are
    included as a separate component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards
    Update

2010-02,

Accounting and Reporting for Decreases in Ownership of a
    Subsidiary — A Scope Clarification

(“ASU

2010-02”),

which amends FASB ASC Topic

820-10

(“FASB ASC Topic

820-10”).

The update addresses implementation issues related to changes in
    ownership provisions in the FASB ASC

820-10.

The
    Company adopted ASU

2010-02

on
    December 31, 2009. This update had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In August 2009, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Update

2009-05,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASU

2009-05”),

which amends FASB ASC Topic

820-10

(“FASB ASC Topic

820-10”).

The update provides clarification on the techniques for
    measurement of fair value required of a reporting entity when a
    quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is
    not available. The Company adopted ASU

2009-05

beginning September 30, 2009. This update had no impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) 168,

The FASB Accounting
    Standards
    Codification

tm

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles — a replacement of FAS 162

(“SFAS 168”), which created FASB ASC Topic

105-10

(“FASB ASC Topic

105-10”).

FASB ASC Topic

105-10

identifies the sources of accounting principles and the
    framework for selecting principles used in the preparation of
    financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are
    presented in conformity with US GAAP (the GAAP hierarchy). The
    Company adopted FASB ASC Topic

105-10

beginning September 30, 2009. This standard had no impact
    on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 165,

Subsequent Events

(“SFAS 165”), codified in FASB ASC Topic

855-10,

which establishes accounting and disclosure standards for events
    that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
    statements are issued or are available to be issued. It defines
    financial statements as available to be issued, requiring the
    disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated
    subsequent events and the basis for that date, whether it be the
    date the financial statements were issued or the date they were
    available to be issued. The Company adopted SFAS 165 upon
    issuance. This standard had no impact on the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

SFAS 115-2

and

SFAS 124-2,

Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments

(“FSP

SFAS 115-2

and

SFAS 124-2”),

which is codified in FASB ASC Topic

320-10.

FSP

SFAS 115-2

and

SFAS 124-2

provides guidance to determine whether the holder of an
    investment in a debt security for which changes in fair value
    are not regularly recognized in earnings should recognize a loss
    in earnings when the investment is impaired. This FSP also
    improves the presentation and disclosure of

other-than-temporary

impairments on debt and equity securities in the consolidated
    financial statements. The Company adopted FSP

SFAS 115-2

and

SFAS 124-2

beginning April 1, 2009. This FSP had no material impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

SFAS 107-1

and Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion APB

28-1,

Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(“FSP

SFAS 107-1

and APB

28-1”).

FSP SFAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

which
    is codified in FASB ASC Topic

825-10-50,

require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments
    for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as
    well as in annual financial statements. The Company adopted FSP

SFAS 107-1

and APB

28-1

beginning April 1, 2009. This FSP had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

SFAS 157-4,

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity
    for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
    Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly

(“FSP

SFAS 157-4”).

FSP

SFAS 157-4,

which is codified in FASB ASC Topics

820-10-35-51

and

820-10-50-2,

provides additional guidance for estimating fair value and
    emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in
    the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and
    regardless of the valuation technique(s) used, the objective



of a fair value measurement remains the same. The Company
    adopted FSP

SFAS 157-4

beginning April 1, 2009. This FSP had no material impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 141(R)-1,

Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a
    Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies

(“FSP SFAS 141(R)-1”). FSP
    SFAS 141(R)-1, which is codified in FASB ASC Topic 805,

Business Combinations

, addresses application issues
    related to the measurement, accounting and disclosure of assets
    and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. The Company adopted FSP SFAS 141(R)-1 upon
    issuance. This FSP had no impact on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets

(“FSP SFAS 132(R)-1”), which is
    codified in FASB ASC Topic

715-20-50.

FSP SFAS 132(R)-1 requires enhanced disclosures about the
    plan assets of a Company’s defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans intended to provide financial
    statement users with a greater understanding of: 1) how
    investment allocation decisions are made; 2) the major
    categories of plan assets; 3) the inputs and valuation
    techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets;
    4) the effect of fair value measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period;
    and 5) significant concentrations of risk within plan
    assets. The Company adopted FSP SFAS 132(R)-1 on
    January 1, 2009. This FSP had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Acquisitions,
    Ventures, Divestitures, Asset Sales and Plant Closures

Acquisitions

In December 2009, the Company acquired the business and assets
    of FACT GmbH (Future Advanced Composites Technology)
    (“FACT”), a German company, for a purchase price of
    €5 million ($7 million). FACT is in the business
    of developing, producing and marketing long fiber reinforced
    thermoplastics. As part of the acquisition, the Company has
    entered into a ten year lease agreement with the seller for the
    property and buildings on which the FACT business is located
    with the option to purchase the property at various times
    throughout the lease. The acquired business is included in the
    Advanced Engineered Materials segment.

In January 2007, the Company acquired the cellulose acetate
    flake, tow and film business of Acetate Products Limited
    (“APL”), a subsidiary of Corsadi B.V. The purchase
    price for the transaction was approximately
    £57 million ($112 million), in addition to direct
    acquisition costs of approximately £4 million
    ($7 million). As contemplated prior to the closing of the
    acquisition, the Company closed the acquired tow production
    plant at Little Heath, United Kingdom in September 2007. In
    accordance with the Company’s sponsor services agreement
    dated January 26, 2005, as amended, the Company paid the
    Advisor $1 million in connection with the acquisition. The
    acquired business is included in the Company’s Consumer
    Specialties segment.

Ventures

In March 2007, the Company entered into a strategic partnership
    with Accsys Technologies PLC (“Accsys”), and its
    subsidiary, Titan Wood, to become the exclusive supplier of
    acetyl products to Titan Wood’s technology licensees for
    use in wood acetylation. In connection with this partnership, in
    May 2007, the Company acquired 8,115,883 shares of
    Accsys’ common stock representing approximately 5.45% of
    the total voting shares of Accsys for €22 million
    ($30 million). The investment was treated as an

available-for-sale

security and was included in Marketable securities, at fair
    value, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. On
    November 20, 2007, the Company and Accsys announced that
    they agreed to amend their business arrangements so that each
    company would have a nonexclusive “at-will” trading
    and supply relationship to give both companies greater
    flexibility. As part of this amendment, the Company subsequently
    sold all of its shares of Accsys stock for approximately
    €20 million ($30 million), which resulted in a
    cumulative loss of $3 million.

Divestitures

In July 2009, the Company completed the sale of its polyvinyl
    alcohol (“PVOH”) business to Sekisui Chemical Co.,
    Ltd. (“Sekisui”) for a net cash purchase price of
    $168 million, resulting in a gain on disposition of
    $34 million. The



net cash purchase price excludes the accounts receivable and
    payable retained by the Company. The transaction includes
    long-term supply agreements between Sekisui and the Company and
    therefore, does not qualify for treatment as a discontinued
    operation. The PVOH business is included in the Industrial
    Specialties segment.

In July 2008, the Company sold its 55.46% interest in Derivados
    Macroquimicos S.A. de C.V. (“DEMACSA”) for proceeds of
    $3 million. DEMACSA produces cellulose ethers at an
    industrial complex in Zacapu, Michoacan, Mexico and is included
    in the Company’s Acetyl Intermediates segment. In June
    2008, the Company recorded a long-lived asset impairment loss of
    $1 million to Cost of sales in the consolidated statements
    of operations. As a result, the proceeds from the sale
    approximated the carrying value of DEMACSA on the date of the
    sale. The Company concluded the sale of DEMACSA is not a
    discontinued operation due to certain forms of continuing
    involvement between the Company and DEMACSA subsequent to the
    sale.

In August 2007, the Company sold its Films business of EVA
    Performance Polymers (f/k/a AT Plastics), located in Edmonton
    and Westlock, Alberta, Canada, to British Polythene Industries
    PLC (“BPI”) for $12 million. The Films business
    manufactures products for the agricultural, horticultural and
    construction industries. The Company recorded a loss on the sale
    of $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007.
    The Company maintained ownership of the Polymers business of the
    business formerly known as AT Plastics, which concentrates on
    the development and supply of specialty resins and compounds.
    EVA Performance Polymers is included in the Company’s
    Industrial Specialties segment. The Company concluded that the
    sale of the Films business is not a discontinued operation due
    to the level of continuing cash flows between the Films business
    and EVA Performance Polymers’ Polymers business subsequent
    to the sale.

In connection with the Company’s strategy to optimize its
    portfolio and divest non-core operations, the Company announced
    in December 2006 its agreement to sell its Acetyl Intermediates
    segment’s oxo products and derivatives businesses,
    including European Oxo GmbH (“EOXO”), a 50/50 venture
    between Celanese GmbH and Degussa AG (“Degussa”), to
    Advent International, for a purchase price of
    €480 million ($636 million) subject to final
    agreement adjustments and the successful exercise of the
    Company’s option to purchase Degussa’s 50% interest in
    EOXO. On February 23, 2007, the option was exercised and
    the Company acquired Degussa’s interest in the venture for
    a purchase price of €30 million ($39 million), in
    addition to €22 million ($29 million) paid to
    extinguish EOXO’s debt upon closing of the transaction. The
    Company completed the sale of its oxo products and derivatives
    businesses, including the acquired 50% interest in EOXO, on
    February 28, 2007. The sale included the oxo and
    derivatives businesses at the Oberhausen, Germany, and Bay City,
    Texas facilities as well as portions of its Bishop, Texas
    facility. Also included were EOXO’s facilities within the
    Oberhausen and Marl, Germany plants. The former oxo products and
    derivatives businesses acquired by Advent International was
    renamed Oxea. Taking into account agreed deductions by the buyer
    for pension and other employee benefits and various costs for
    separation activities, the Company received proceeds of
    approximately €443 million ($585 million) at
    closing. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a
    $47 million pre-tax gain, recorded to Gain (loss) on
    disposal of discontinued operations, which includes certain
    working capital and other adjustments, in 2007. Due to certain
    lease-back arrangements between the Company and the buyer and
    related environmental obligations of the Company, approximately
    $51 million of the transaction proceeds attributable to the
    fair value of the underlying land at Bay City ($1 million)
    and Oberhausen (€36 million) is included in deferred
    proceeds in noncurrent Other liabilities, and divested land with
    a book value of $14 million (€10 million at
    Oberhausen and $1 million at Bay City) remains in Property,
    plant and equipment, net in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets.

Subsequent to closing, the Company and Oxea have certain site
    service and product supply arrangements. The site services
    include, but are not limited to, administrative, utilities,
    health and safety, waste water treatment and maintenance
    activities for terms which range up to fifteen years. Product
    supply agreements contain initial terms of up to fifteen years.
    The Company has no contractual ability through these agreements
    or any other arrangements to significantly influence the
    operating or financial policies of Oxea. The Company concluded,
    based on the nature and limited projected magnitude of the
    continuing business relationship between the Company and Oxea,
    the divestiture of the oxo products and derivatives businesses
    should be accounted for as a discontinued operation.

Third-party net sales include $5 million to the divested
    oxo products and derivative businesses for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 that were eliminated upon consolidation.



In accordance with the Company’s sponsor services agreement
    dated January 26, 2005, as amended, the Company paid the
    Advisor $6 million in connection with the sale of the oxo
    products and derivatives businesses.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company discontinued its
    Edmonton, Alberta, Canada methanol operations, which were
    included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment. As a result, the
    earnings (loss) from operations related to Edmonton methanol are
    accounted for as discontinued operations.

Asset
    Sales

In May 2008, shareholders of the Company’s Koper, Slovenia
    legal entity voted to approve the April 2008 decision by the
    Company to permanently shut down this emulsions production site.
    The decision to shut down the site resulted in employee
    severance of less than $1 million, which is included in
    Other (charges) gains, net, in the consolidated statements of
    operations during the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Currently, the facility is idle and the existing fixed assets,
    including machinery and equipment, buildings and land are being
    marketed for sale. The Koper, Slovenia legal entity is included
    in the Company’s Industrial Specialties segment.

In December 2007, the Company sold the assets at its Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility to a real estate developer for
    approximately $35 million. As part of the agreement, the
    Company will retain certain environmental liabilities associated
    with the site. The Company derecognized $16 million of
    asset retirement obligations which were transferred to the
    buyer. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a gain of
    $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, of
    which a gain of $34 million was recorded to Gain (loss) on
    disposition of businesses and assets, net in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

In July 2007, the Company reached an agreement with
    Babcock & Brown, a worldwide investment firm which
    specializes in real estate and utilities development, to sell
    the Company’s Pampa, Texas facility. The Company ceased
    operations at the site in December 2008. Proceeds received upon
    certain milestone events are treated as deferred proceeds and
    included in noncurrent Other liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets until the transaction is complete
    (expected to be in 2010), as defined in the sales agreement.
    These operations are included in the Company’s Acetyl
    Intermediates segment. During the second half of 2008, the
    Company determined that two of the milestone events, which are
    outside of the Company’s control, were unlikely to be
    achieved. The Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis
    which resulted in a $23 million long-lived asset impairment
    loss recorded to Other (charges) gains, net, in the consolidated
    statements of operations during the year ended December 31,
    2008 (Note 18).

Plant
    Closures

In July 2009, the Company’s wholly-owned French subsidiary,
    Acetex Chimie, completed the consultation procedure with the
    workers council on its “Project of Closure” and social
    plan related to the Company’s Pardies, France facility
    pursuant to which the Company announced its formal plan to cease
    all manufacturing operations and associated activities by
    December 2009. The Company agreed with the workers council on a
    set of measures of assistance aimed at minimizing the effects of
    the plant’s closing on the Pardies workforce, including
    training, outplacement and severance.

As a result of the Project of Closure, the Company recorded exit
    costs of $89 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, which included $60 million in
    employee termination benefits, $17 million of contract
    termination costs and $12 million of long-lived asset
    impairment losses (see Note 18) to Other charges
    (gains), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    fair value of the related held and used long-lived assets is
    $4 million as of December 31, 2009. In addition, the
    Company recorded $9 million of accelerated depreciation
    expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    $8 million of environmental remediation reserves for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 related to the shutdown of the
    Company’s Pardies, France facility. The Pardies, France
    facility is included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment.

Certain investments where the Company owns greater than a 20%
    ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of
    accounting because the Company cannot exercise significant
    influence over these entities. The Company determined that it
    cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to
    local government investment in and influence over these
    entities, limitations on the Company’s involvement in the

day-to-day

operations and the present inability of the entities to provide
    timely financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

During 2007, the Company wrote-off its remaining
    €1 million ($1 million) cost investment in
    European Pipeline Development Company B.V. (“EPDC”)
    and expensed €7 million ($9 million), included in
    Other income (expense), net, associated with contingent
    liabilities that became payable due to the Company’s
    decision to exit the pipeline development project. In June 2008,
    the outstanding contingent liabilities were resolved and the
    Company recognized a gain of €2 million
    ($2 million), included in Other income (expense), net, in
    the consolidated statements of operations to remove the
    remaining accrual.

During 2007, the Company fully impaired its $5 million cost
    investment in Elemica Corporation (“Elemica”). Elemica
    is a network for the global chemical industry developed by 22 of
    the leading chemical companies in the world for the benefit of
    the entire industry. The impairment was included in Other income
    (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Fully impaired goodwill of $6 million was written off
    related to the sale of PVOH.

Recoverability of goodwill is measured using a discounted cash
    flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the
    risks involved for each reporting unit which is classified as a
    Level 3 measurement under FASB ASC Topic 820. The key
    assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model
    include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and
    terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow
    projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as
    they require significant management judgment. If the calculated
    fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment
    of the reporting unit may exist. When the recoverability test
    indicates potential impairment, the Company, or in certain
    circumstances, a third-party valuation consultant, will
    calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting
    unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a
    manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business
    combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the
    carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there
    is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to
    a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill,
    an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying
    value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of
    goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain
    long-lived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the
    reporting unit may require additional impairment testing.

In connection with the Company’s annual goodwill impairment
    test performed during the three months ended September 30,
    2009 using June 30 balances, the Company did not record an
    impairment loss related to goodwill as the estimated fair value
    for each of the Company’s reporting units exceeded the
    carrying value of the underlying assets by a substantial margin.
    No events or changes in circumstances occurred during the three
    months ended December 31, 2009 that would indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, as
    such, no additional impairment analysis was performed during
    that period.

Acquisition of a sole and exclusive license to patents and
    patent applications related to acetic acid. The license is being
    amortized over 10 years.

Aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets with finite
    lives during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007 was $72 million, $76 million, and
    $72 million, respectively. In addition, during the year
    ended December 31, 2009 the Company recorded accelerated
    amortization expense of $5 million related to the AT
    Plastics trade name which was discontinued August 1, 2009.
    The trade name is now fully amortized.

Estimated amortization expense for the succeeding five fiscal
    years is approximately $62 million in 2010,
    $57 million in 2011, $43 million in 2012,
    $26 million in 2013, and $15 million in 2014. The
    Company’s trademarks and trade names have an indefinite
    life. Accordingly, no amortization is recorded on these
    intangible assets.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing
    the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair
    value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset which is
    classified as a Level 3 measurement under FASB ASC Topic
    820. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company’s
    theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible
    asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount
    rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and
    terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth
    rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive
    and susceptible to change as they require significant management
    judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated
    by the weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”)
    considering any differences in Company-specific risk factors.
    Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically
    substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. Operational
    management, considering industry and Company-specific historical
    and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections
    associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal
    value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing
    the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last
    projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term
    growth rates.

In connection with the Company’s annual indefinite-lived
    intangible assets impairment test performed during the three
    months ended September 30, 2009 using June 30 balances, the
    Company recorded an impairment loss of less



than $1 million to certain indefinite-lived intangible
    assets. The fair value of such indefinite-lived intangible
    assets is $2 million as of December 31, 2009. No
    events or changes in circumstances occurred during the three
    months ended December 31, 2009 that would indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, as
    such, no additional impairment analysis was performed during
    that period.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company did not
    renew or extend any intangible assets.

Included in the asset retirement obligations for each of the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is $10 million
    related to a business acquired in 2005. The Company has a
    corresponding receivable of $3 million and $7 million
    included in current Other assets and noncurrent Other assets in
    the consolidated balance sheets, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2009.

Based on long-lived asset impairment triggering events assessed
    by the Company in December 2008 and decisions made by the
    Company in 2009, the Company concluded several sites no longer
    have an indeterminate life. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    asset retirement obligations associated with these sites. The
    Company uses the expected present value technique to measure the
    fair value of the asset retirement obligations which is
    classified as a Level 3 measurement under FASB ASC Topic
    820. The expected present value technique uses a set of cash
    flows that represent the probability-weighted average of all
    possible cash flows based on the Company’s judgment. The
    Company uses the following inputs to determine the fair value of
    the asset retirement obligations based on the Company’s
    experience with fulfilling obligations of this type and the
    Company’s knowledge of market conditions: a) labor
    costs; b) allocation of overhead costs; c) profit on
    labor and overhead costs; d) effect of inflation on
    estimated costs and profits; e) risk premium for bearing
    the uncertainty inherent in cash flows, other than inflation;
    f) time value of money represented by the risk-free
    interest rate commensurate with the timing of the associated
    cash flows; and g) nonperformance risk relating to the
    liability which includes the Company’s own credit risk.

The Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement
    obligations related to certain of its existing operating
    facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include
    demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration
    activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the
    retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or
    abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company
    currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities
    indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value
    cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company
    considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites,
    an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time.
    If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset
    retirement obligations could significantly affect the
    Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

Senior
    Credit Facilities

The Company’s senior credit agreement consists of
    $2,280 million of US dollar-denominated and
    €400 million of Euro-denominated term loans due 2014,
    a $600 million revolving credit facility terminating in
    2013 and a $228 million credit-linked revolving facility
    terminating in 2014. Borrowings under the senior credit
    agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on
    LIBOR (for US dollars) or EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable,
    or, for US dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances,
    a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The
    applicable margin for the term loans and any loans under the
    credit-linked revolving facility is 1.75%, subject to potential
    reductions as defined in the senior credit agreement. As of
    December 31, 2009, the applicable margin was 1.75%. The
    term loans under the senior credit agreement are subject to
    amortization at 1% of the initial principal amount per annum,
    payable quarterly. The remaining principal amount of the term
    loans is due on April 2, 2014.

As of December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding
    borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
    credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, there were
    $88 million of letters of credit issued under the
    credit-linked revolving facility and $140 million remained
    available for borrowing.

On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to
    the senior credit agreement. The amendment reduced the amount
    available under the revolving credit facility from
    $650 million to $600 million and increased the first
    lien senior secured leverage ratio covenant that is applicable
    when any amount is outstanding under the revolving credit
    portion of the senior credit agreement at set forth below. Prior
    to giving effect to the amendment, the maximum first lien senior
    secured leverage ratio was 3.90 to 1.00. As amended, the maximum
    senior secured leverage ratio for the following trailing
    four-quarter periods is as follows:

First Lien Senior

Secured Leverage Ratio

December 31, 2009

5.25 to 1.00

March 31, 2010

4.75 to 1.00

June 30, 2010

4.25 to 1.00

September 30, 2010

4.25 to 1.00

December 31, 2010 and thereafter

3.90 to 1.00



As a condition to borrowing funds or requesting that letters of
    credit be issued under that facility, the Company’s first
    lien senior secured leverage ratio (as calculated as of the last
    day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial
    statements have been delivered under the revolving facility)
    cannot exceed a certain threshold as specified above. Further,
    the Company’s first lien senior secured leverage ratio must
    be maintained at or below that threshold while any amounts are
    outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The first lien
    senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of
    consolidated first lien senior secured debt to earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to
    adjustment identified in the credit agreement.

Based on the estimated first lien senior secured leverage ratio
    for the trailing four quarters at December 31, 2009, the
    Company’s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit
    facility is currently $600 million. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company estimates its first lien senior secured
    leverage ratio to be 3.39 to 1.00 (which would be 4.11 to 1.00
    were the revolving credit facility fully drawn). The maximum
    first lien senior secured leverage ratio under the revolving
    credit facility for such period is 5.25 to 1.00.

The Company’s senior credit agreement also contains a
    number of restrictions on certain of its subsidiaries,
    including, but not limited to, restrictions on their ability to
    incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate,
    or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments;
    make investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage
    in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback
    transactions or certain hedge transactions; or engage in other
    businesses. The senior credit agreement also contains a number
    of affirmative covenants and events of default, including a
    cross default to other debt of certain of the Company’s
    subsidiaries in an aggregate amount equal to more than
    $40 million and the occurrence of a change of control.
    Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any
    other event of default, could result in acceleration of the
    loans and other financial obligations under the Company’s
    senior credit agreement.

The senior credit agreement is guaranteed by Celanese Holdings
    LLC, a subsidiary of Celanese Corporation, and certain domestic
    subsidiaries of the Company’s subsidiary, Celanese US
    Holdings LLC (“Celanese US”), a Delaware limited
    liability company, and is secured by a lien on substantially all
    assets of Celanese US and such guarantors, subject to certain
    agreed exceptions, pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral
    Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2007, by and among Celanese
    Holdings LLC, Celanese US, certain subsidiaries of Celanese US
    and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as Administrative Agent
    and as Collateral Agent.

The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants related
    to its debt agreements as of December 31, 2009.

Debt
    Refinancing

In April 2007, the Company, through certain of its subsidiaries,
    entered into a new senior credit agreement. Proceeds from the
    new senior credit agreement, together with available cash, were
    used to retire the Company’s $2,454 million amended
    and restated (January 2005) senior credit facilities, which
    consisted of $1,626 million in term loans due 2011, a
    $600 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2009
    and a $228 million credit-linked revolving facility
    terminating in 2009, and to retire all of the Company’s
    9.625% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and
    10.375% senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the
    “Senior Subordinated Notes”) and 10% senior
    discount notes due 2014 and 10.5% senior discount notes due
    2014 (the “Senior Discount Notes”) as discussed below.

Substantially all of the Senior Discount Notes and Senior
    Subordinated Notes were tendered in the first quarter of 2007.
    The remaining outstanding Senior Discount Notes and Senior
    Subordinated Notes not tendered in conjunction with the Tender
    Offers were redeemed by the Company in May 2007 through optional
    redemption allowed in the indentures.

As a result of the refinancing, the Company incurred premiums
    paid on early redemption of debt of $207 million,
    accelerated amortization of premiums and deferred financing
    costs of $33 million and other refinancing expenses of
    $16 million.

In connection with the refinancing, the Company recorded
    deferred financing costs of $39 million related to the
    senior credit agreement, which are included in noncurrent Other
    assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are being
    amortized over the term of the new senior credit agreement. The
    deferred financing costs consist of $23 million of costs
    incurred to acquire the new senior credit agreement and
    $16 million of debt issue costs existing prior to the
    refinancing.



For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company recorded amortization of deferred financing costs, which
    is classified in Interest expense, of $7 million,
    $7 million, and $8 million, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Company had
    $27 million and $32 million of net deferred financing
    costs.

Principal payments scheduled to be made on the Company’s
    debt, including short-term borrowings, are as follows:

Benefit
    Obligations

Pension obligations.

Pension obligations are
    established for benefits payable in the form of retirement,
    disability and surviving dependent pensions. The commitments
    result from participation in defined contribution and defined
    benefit plans, primarily in the US. Benefits are dependent on
    years of service and the employee’s compensation.
    Supplemental retirement benefits provided to certain employees
    are nonqualified for US tax purposes. Separate trusts have been
    established for some nonqualified plans. Pension costs under the
    Company’s retirement plans are actuarially determined.

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia. Independent trusts or insurance
    companies administer the majority of these plans.

The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia covering certain employees. Employees
    may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these
    contributions in varying amounts. The Company’s matching
    contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on
    specified percentages of employee contributions and aggregated
    $11 million, $13 million and $12 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company participates in multiemployer defined benefit
    pension plans in Europe covering certain employees. The
    Company’s contributions to the multiemployer defined
    benefit pension plans are based on specified percentages of
    employee contributions and aggregated $6 million,
    $7 million and $7 million, for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Other postretirement obligations.

Certain retired
    employees receive postretirement healthcare and life insurance
    benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which has the
    right to modify or terminate these plans at any time. The cost
    for coverage is shared between the Company and the retiree. The
    cost of providing retiree health care and life insurance
    benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service
    period of the active employee group. The Company’s policy
    is to fund benefits as claims and premiums are paid. The US plan
    was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2006.



The following tables set forth the benefit obligations, the fair
    value of the plan assets and the funded status of the
    Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans; and the

Included in the pension obligations above are accrued
    liabilities relating to supplemental retirement plans for
    certain US employees amounting to $235 million and
    $224 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Pension expense relating to these plans included
    in net periodic benefit cost totaled $15 million,
    $15 million and $14 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. To fund
    these obligations, nonqualified trusts were established which
    hold marketable securities valued at $82 million and
    $97 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. In addition to holding marketable securities, the
    nonqualified trusts hold investments in insurance contracts of
    $66 million and $67 million as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, which are included in noncurrent
    Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Valuation

The Company uses the corridor approach in the valuation of its
    defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits. The
    corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses
    resulting from variances between actual results and economic
    estimates or actuarial assumptions. For defined benefit pension
    plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when
    the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the
    market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. For other
    postretirement benefits, amortization occurs when the net gains
    and losses exceed 10% of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. The amount in excess of
    the corridor is amortized over the average remaining service
    period to retirement date for active plan participants or, for
    retired participants, the average remaining life expectancy.

The expected rate of return is assessed annually and is based on
    long-term relationships among major asset classes and the level
    of incremental returns that can be earned by the successful
    implementation of different active investment management
    strategies. Equity returns are based on estimates of long-term
    inflation rate, real rate of return,

10-year

Treasury bond premium over cash and equity risk premium. Fixed
    income returns are based on maturity, long-term inflation, real
    rate of return and credit spreads. The US qualified defined
    benefit plans’ actual return on assets for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was 18% versus an expected long-term rate
    of asset return assumption of 8.5%.

In the US, the rate used to discount pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan liabilities was based on a yield
    curve developed from market data of over 300 Aa-grade
    non-callable bonds at December 31, 2009. This yield curve
    has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the
    obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension and
    other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding
    rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount
    rate.

The Company determines its discount rates in the Euro zone using
    the iBoxx Euro Corporate AA Bond indices with appropriate
    adjustments for the duration of the plan obligations. In other
    international locations, the Company determines its discount
    rates based on the yields of high quality government bonds with
    a duration appropriate to the duration of the plan obligations.

On January 1, 2009, the Company’s health care cost
    trend assumption for US postretirement medical plan’s net
    periodic benefit cost was 9% for the first year declining 0.5%
    per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. On January 1, 2008, the
    Company’s health care cost trend assumption for US
    postretirement medical plan’s net periodic benefit cost was
    9% for the first two years declining 0.5% per year to an
    ultimate rate of 5%. On January 1, 2007, the health care
    cost trend rate was 8.5% per year declining 1% per year to an
    ultimate rate of 5%.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
    one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed health
    care cost trend rate would impact postretirement obligations by
    $4 million and $(3) million, respectively. The effect
    of a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care
    cost trend rate would have a less than $1 million impact on
    service and interest cost.

Plan
    Assets

The investment objective for the plans are to earn, over moving
    twenty-year periods, the long-term expected rate of return, net
    of investment fees and transaction costs, to satisfy the benefit
    obligations of the plan, while at the same time maintaining
    sufficient liquidity to pay benefit obligations and proper
    expenses, and meet any other cash needs, in the short- to
    medium-term.

The equity and debt securities objectives are to provide
    diversified exposure across the US and Global equity markets and
    to manage the plan’s risks and returns through the use of
    multiple managers and strategies. The fixed income portfolio
    objectives are to hedge a portion of the interest rate risks
    associated with the plan’s funding target liabilities. The
    goal of the liability hedging bond is to reduce surplus
    volatility and provide a liquidity reserve for paying off
    benefits. The strategy is designed to reduce liability-related
    interest rate risk by investing in bonds that match the duration
    and credit quality of the projected plan liabilities.
    Derivatives based strategies may be used to improve the
    effectiveness of the hedges. Other types of investments include
    investments in real estate and insurance contracts that follow
    several different strategies.

As discussed in Note 3, the Company adopted certain
    provisions of FASB ASC Topic

715-20-50

on
    January 1, 2009. FASB ASC Topic

715-20-50

requires enhanced disclosures about the plan assets of a
    company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans intended to provide financial statement users with a
    greater understanding of the inputs and valuation techniques
    used to measure the fair value of plan assets and the effect of
    fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on
    changes in plan assets for the period using the framework
    established under FASB ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurements
    and Disclosures

. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
    value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority
    to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). This
    hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a
    financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels
    of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon
    the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
    calculation. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair
    value are as follows:

Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company

Level 2 — inputs that are observable in the
    marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1

Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable in the
    marketplace and significant to the valuation

The Company’s defined benefit plan assets are measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis and include the following items:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Foreign and
    domestic currencies as well as short term securities are valued
    at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.

Common/Collective Trusts:

Composed of various
    funds whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and
    domestic equities, fixed income securities, and short term
    investments. Investments are valued at the net asset value of
    units held by the plan at year-end.



Corporate stock and government and corporate
    debt:

Valued at the closing price reported on the
    active market in which the individual securities are traded.
    Automated quotes are provided by multiple pricing services and
    validated by the plan custodian. These securities are traded on
    exchanges as well as in the over the counter market.

Registered Investment Companies:

Composed of
    various mutual funds and other investment companies whose
    diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic
    equities, fixed income securities, and short term investments.
    Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by
    the plan at year-end.

Mortgage Backed Securities:

Fair value is
    estimated based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing
    services for identical or comparable assets. Mortgage Backed
    Securities are traded in the over the counter broker/dealer
    market.

Derivatives:

Derivative financial instruments
    are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques.
    These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2
    inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange
    rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash
    flow calculation considering the instrument’s term,
    notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant
    inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps,
    foreign currency forwards and swaps, and options are observable
    in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the
    hierarchy.

Insurance contracts:

Valued at contributions
    made, plus earnings, less participant withdrawals and
    administrative expenses, which approximates fair value.

The financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are
    established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each
    plan’s liability structure. The Company’s asset
    allocation policy is based on detailed asset/liability analyses.
    In developing investment policy and financial goals,
    consideration is given to each plan’s demographics, the
    returns and risks associated with alternative investment
    strategies and the current and projected cash, expense and
    funding ratios of each plan. Investment policies must also
    comply with local statutory requirements as determined by each
    country. A formal asset/liability study of each plan is
    undertaken every 3 to 5 years or whenever there has been a
    material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or
    funding status and investment market. The Company has adopted a
    long-term investment horizon such that the risk and duration of
    investment losses are weighed against the long-term potential
    for appreciation of assets. Although there cannot be complete
    assurance that these objectives will be realized, it is believed
    that the likelihood for their realization is reasonably high,
    based upon the asset allocation chosen and the historical and
    expected performance of the asset classes utilized by the plans.
    The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified across
    asset classes, investment styles, market sectors, investment
    managers, developed and emerging markets and securities in order
    to moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments may be in
    separate accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and other
    pooled asset portfolios provided they all conform to fiduciary
    standards.

External investment managers are hired to manage pension assets.
    Investment consultants assist with the screening process for
    each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the investment
    portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a composite of
    market indices that are weighted to match each plan’s
    target asset allocation. The portfolio return should also (over
    the long-term) meet or exceed the return used for actuarial
    calculations in order to meet the future needs of each plan.

Employer contributions for pension benefits and postretirement
    benefits are preliminarily estimated to be $46 million and
    $27 million, respectively, in 2010. The table below
    reflects pension benefits expected to be paid from the plan or
    from the Company’s assets. The postretirement benefits

Environmental

General

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations
    worldwide which impose limitations on the discharge of
    pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for
    the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes. The Company believes that it is in substantial
    compliance with all applicable environmental laws and
    regulations. The Company is also subject to retained
    environmental obligations specified in various contractual
    agreements arising from the divestiture of certain businesses by
    the Company or one of its predecessor companies.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company’s expenditures, including expenditures for legal
    compliance, internal environmental initiatives and remediation
    of active, orphan, divested and US Superfund sites (as defined
    below) were $78 million, $78 million, and
    $83 million, respectively. The Company’s capital
    project-related environmental expenditures for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $22 million,
    $13 million, and $14 million, respectively.
    Environmental reserves for remediation matters were
    $106 million and $98 million as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, which represents the Company’s
    best estimate of its liability.

Remediation

Due to its industrial history and through retained contractual
    and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to
    remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on
    divested, orphan or US Superfund sites. In addition, as part of
    the demerger agreement between the Company and Hoechst, a
    specified portion of the responsibility for environmental
    liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was
    transferred to the Company. The Company provides for such
    obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably
    estimable.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    total remediation efforts charged to Cost of sales in the
    consolidated statements of operations were $9 million,
    $3 million and $4 million, respectively. The Company
    believes that environmental remediation costs will not have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position of the
    Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results
    of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period.

The Company did not record any insurance recoveries related to
    these matters for the reported periods and there are no
    receivables for insurance recoveries as of December 31,
    2009. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were
    receivables of $9 million and $9 million,
    respectively, from the former owner APL, which was acquired in
    2007 (see Note 4).

German
    InfraServs

On January 1, 1997, coinciding with a reorganization of the
    Hoechst businesses in Germany, real estate service companies
    (“InfraServs”) were created to own directly the land
    and property and to provide various technical and administrative
    services at each of the manufacturing locations. The Company has
    manufacturing operations at the InfraServ location in Frankfurt
    am Main-Hoechst, Germany and holds interests in the companies
    which own and operate the former Hoechst sites in Gendorf,
    Knapsack and Wiesbaden.



InfraServs are liable for any residual contamination and other
    pollution because they own the real estate on which the
    individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, as the responsible party under German public
    law, is liable to third parties for all environmental damage
    that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and
    real estate. The contribution agreements entered into in 1997
    between Hoechst and the respective operating companies, as part
    of the divestiture of these companies, provide that the
    operating companies will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, against environmental liabilities resulting from the
    transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServs have agreed
    to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against any
    environmental liability arising out of or in connection with
    environmental pollution of any site. Likewise, in certain
    circumstances the Company could be responsible for the
    elimination of residual contamination on a few sites that were
    not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst,
    and its legal successors, must reimburse the Company for
    two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between
    the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination
    caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which
    cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no
    third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the
    InfraServ partnership. In view of this potential obligation to
    eliminate residual contamination, the InfraServs, primarily
    relating to equity and cost affiliates which are not
    consolidated by the Company, have reserves of $94 million
    and $84 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective
    indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination,
    the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ
    companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a
    number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are
    not satisfied by either the InfraServs or their owners, these
    liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with
    the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any
    such costs. Likewise, in certain circumstances the Company could
    be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on
    several sites that were not transferred to InfraServ companies,
    in which case Hoechst, and its legal successors, must also
    reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.
    The German InfraServs are owned partially by the Company, as
    noted below, and the remaining ownership is held by various
    other companies. The Company’s ownership interest and
    environmental liability participation percentages for such
    liabilities which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner
    were as follows as of December 31, 2009:

US
    Superfund Sites

In the US, the Company may be subject to substantial claims
    brought by US federal or state regulatory agencies or private
    individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In
    particular, the Company has a potential liability under the US
    Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws
    (collectively referred to as “Superfund”) for
    investigation and cleanup costs at approximately 50 sites. At
    most of these sites, numerous companies, including certain
    companies comprising the Company, or one of its predecessor
    companies, have been notified that the Environmental Protection
    Agency, state governing bodies or private individuals consider
    such companies to be potentially responsible parties
    (“PRP”) under Superfund or related laws. The
    proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The
    cleanup process has not been completed at most sites and the
    status of the insurance coverage for most of these proceedings
    is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot accurately
    determine its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup
    costs at these sites.

As events progress at each site for which it has been named a
    PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site
    cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these
    liabilities, the Company considers its shipment of waste to a
    site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the



site, the types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any
    studies, the magnitude of any remedial actions that may be
    necessary and the number and viability of other PRPs. Often the
    Company will join with other PRPs to sign joint defense
    agreements that will settle, among PRPs, each party’s
    percentage allocation of costs at the site. Although the
    ultimate liability may differ from the estimate, the Company
    routinely reviews the liabilities and revises the estimate, as
    appropriate, based on the most current information available. As
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had provisions
    totaling $10 million and $11 million, respectively,
    for US Superfund sites and utilized $1 million,
    $2 million and $1 million of these reserves during the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Additional provisions and adjustments recorded during the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 approximately offset
    these expenditures.

Hoechst
    Liabilities

In connection with the Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to
    indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, for the first
    €250 million of future remediation liabilities for
    environmental damages arising from 19 specified divested Hoechst
    entities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, reserves of
    $32 million and $27 million, respectively, for these
    matters are included as a component of the total environmental
    reserves. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company,
    has made total cumulative payments of $51 million and
    $48 million, respectively. If such future liabilities
    exceed €250 million, Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, will bear such excess up to an additional
    €500 million. Thereafter, the Company will bear
    one-third and Hoechst, and its legal successors, will bear
    two-thirds of any further environmental remediation liabilities.
    Where the Company is unable to reasonably determine the
    probability of loss or estimate such loss under this
    indemnification, the Company has not recognized any liabilities
    relative to this indemnification.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has $240 million aggregate liquidation
    preference of outstanding 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred
    stock (“Preferred Stock”). Holders of the Preferred
    Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if, declared by the
    Company’s Board of Directors, out of funds legally
    available, cash dividends at the rate of 4.25% per annum of
    liquidation preference, payable quarterly in arrears, commencing
    on May 1, 2005. Dividends on the Preferred Stock are
    cumulative from the date of initial issuance. Accumulated but
    unpaid dividends accumulate at an annual rate of 4.25%. The
    Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at
    any time into approximately 1.26 shares of Series A
    common stock, subject to adjustments, per $25.00 liquidation
    preference of Preferred Stock and upon conversion will be
    recorded in the consolidated statements of shareholders’
    equity and comprehensive income (loss). On February 1,
    2010, the Company announced its intention to redeem its
    Preferred Stock (Note 31).

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company declared and paid
    $10 million of cash dividends in each period on its
    Preferred Stock.

Dividends

The Company’s Board of Directors follows a policy of
    declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash
    dividend on each share of the Company’s Series A
    common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per share unless the
    Company’s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion,
    determines otherwise. Further, such dividends payable to holders
    of the Company’s Series A common stock cannot be
    declared or paid nor can any funds be set aside for the payment
    thereof, unless the Company has paid or set aside funds for the
    payment of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to
    the shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock, as described
    above. Additionally, the amount available to pay cash dividends
    is restricted by the Company’s senior credit agreement.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company declared and paid cash
    dividends of $23 million, $24 million and
    $25 million, respectively, to holders of its Series A
    common stock.



Treasury
    Stock

In conjunction with the April 2007 debt refinancing
    (Note 14), the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
    Celanese International Holdings Luxembourg S.à.r.l.
    (“CIH”), formerly Celanese Caylux Holdings Luxembourg
    S.C.A., repurchased 2,021,775 shares of its outstanding
    Series A common stock in a modified “Dutch
    Auction” tender offer from public shareholders, which
    expired on April 3, 2007, at a purchase price of $30.50 per
    share. The total price paid for these shares was
    $62 million. The Company also separately purchased, through
    its wholly-owned subsidiary CIH, 329,011 shares of the
    Company’s Series A common stock at $30.50 per share
    from the investment funds associated with The Blackstone Group
    L.P. The total price paid for these shares was $10 million.

In June 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $330 million of its Series A
    common stock. During 2007, the Company repurchased
    8,487,700 shares of its Series A common stock at an
    average purchase price of $38.88 per share for a total of
    $330 million pursuant to this authorization. The Company
    completed repurchasing shares related to this authorization
    during July 2007.

In February 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of the
    Company’s Series A common stock. This authorization
    was increased to $500 million in October 2008. The
    authorization gives management discretion in determining the
    conditions under which shares may be repurchased.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    repurchased 9,763,200 shares of its Series A common
    stock at an average purchase price of $38.68 per share for a
    total of $378 million pursuant to this authorization.

These purchases reduced the number of shares outstanding and the
    repurchased shares may be used by the Company for compensation
    programs utilizing the Company’s stock and other corporate
    purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost
    method.

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company began efforts to
    align production capacity and staffing levels with the
    Company’s view of an economic environment of prolonged
    lower demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Other
    charges included employee termination benefits of
    $40 million related to this endeavor. As a result of the
    shutdown of the vinyl acetate monomer (“VAM”)
    production unit in Cangrejera, Mexico, the Company recognized
    employee termination benefits of $1 million and long-lived
    asset impairment losses of $1 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The VAM production unit in Cangrejera,
    Mexico is included in the Company’s Acetyl Intermediates
    segment.

As a result of the Project of Closure (Note 4), Other
    charges for the Company included exit costs of $89 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, which consisted of
    $60 million in employee termination benefits,
    $17 million of contract termination costs and
    $12 million of long-lived asset impairment losses related
    to capitalized costs associated with asset retirement
    obligations (Note 13). The Pardies, France facility is
    included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment.

Due to continued declines in demand in automotive and electronic
    sectors, the Company announced plans to reduce capacity by
    ceasing polyester polymer production at its Ticona manufacturing
    plant in Shelby, North Carolina. Other charges for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 included employee termination
    benefits of $2 million and long-lived asset impairment
    losses of $1 million related to this event. The Shelby,
    North Carolina facility is included in the Advanced Engineered
    Materials segment.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    partially offset by $6 million of insurance recoveries in
    satisfaction of claims the Company made related to the unplanned
    outage of the Company’s Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid
    facility during 2007, a $9 million decrease in legal
    reserves for plumbing claims due to the Company’s ongoing
    assessment of the likely outcome of the plumbing actions and the
    expiration of the statute of limitation.


Other (charges) gains, net for asset impairments includes
    long-lived asset impairment losses of $92 million related
    to the potential closure of the Company’s acetic acid and
    VAM production facility in Pardies, France, the VAM production
    unit in Cangrejera, Mexico (which the Company subsequently
    decided to shut down effective at the end of February
    2009) and certain other facilities. Of the $92 million
    recorded in December 2008, $76 million relates to the
    Acetyl Intermediates segment and $16 million relates to the
    Advanced Engineered Materials segment. Consideration of this
    potential capacity reduction was necessitated by the significant
    change in the global economic environment and anticipated lower
    customer demand.



Additionally, the Company recognized $23 million of
    long-lived asset impairment losses related to the shutdown of
    the Company’s Pampa, Texas facility (Acetyl Intermediates
    segment).

Other (charges) gains, net for employee termination benefits
    includes severance and retention charges of $13 million
    related to the sale of the Company’s Pampa, Texas facility
    and $8 million of severance and retention charges related
    to other business optimization plans undertaken by the Company.


Other (charges) gains, net for employee termination benefits and
    plant/office closures include charges related to the
    Company’s plan to simplify and optimize its Emulsions and
    PVOH businesses (Industrial Specialties segment) to become a
    leader in technology and innovation and grow in both new and
    existing markets. Other (charges) gains, net for employee
    termination benefits and plant/office closures also includes
    charges related to the sale of the Company’s Pampa, Texas
    facility. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment of
    long-lived assets of $3 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

In December 2007, the Company received a one-time payment in
    resolution of commercial disputes with a vendor.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, asset impairments
    included $6 million of goodwill impairment related to the
    PVOH business.

Includes deferred tax asset valuation allowances primarily
    for the Company’s deferred tax assets in the US,
    Luxembourg, France and Germany, as well as other foreign
    jurisdictions. These valuation allowances relate primarily to
    net operating loss carryforward benefits and other net deferred
    tax assets, all of which may not be realizable.

Since 2004, the Company has maintained a valuation allowance
    against its US net deferred tax assets. FASB ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

, requires the Company to continually assess
    all available positive and negative evidence to determine
    whether it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax
    assets will be realized. During 2009, the Company concluded that
    due to cumulative profitability, it is more likely than not that
    it will realize its net US deferred tax assets with the
    exception of certain state net operating loss carryforwards.
    Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $492 million for
    the release of the

beginning-of-the-year

US valuation allowance associated with those US net deferred tax
    assets expected to be realized in 2009 and subsequent years.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the valuation
    allowance decreased by $318 million consisting of:
    (1) income tax benefits, net, of $314 million,
    (2) an increase of $1 million allocated to Accumulated
    other comprehensive income, (3) an increase of
    $11 million related to foreign currency translation
    adjustments and (4) $16 million of other decreases
    related to unrecognized tax benefits and other adjustments to
    deferred taxes. The charge to Accumulated other comprehensive
    income relates to deferred tax assets associated with the
    Company’s pension and postretirement obligations. The
    change in valuation allowance associated with foreign currency
    translation adjustments is related to changes in deferred tax
    assets for unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on
    effective hedges and on foreign income previously taxed but not
    yet received in the US. The charge also relates to foreign
    currency translation adjustments for deferred tax assets
    recorded in various foreign jurisdictions. The decrease related
    to unrecognized tax benefits and other adjustments to deferred
    taxes includes adjustments to temporary differences and net
    operating loss carryforwards due to changes in uncertain tax
    positions.

A reconciliation of the significant differences between the US
    federal statutory tax rate of 35% and the effective income tax
    rate on income from continuing operations is as follows:

Includes impact of earnings from China and Singapore
    subject to tax holidays which expire between 2008 and 2013 and
    favorable tax rates in other jurisdictions.

Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on
    accumulated but undistributed earnings of $2.8 billion as
    of December 31, 2009 as such earnings have been permanently
    reinvested in the business. The determination of the amount of
    the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the
    undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 was (101)% compared to 15% for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. The effective tax rate for
    2009 was favorably impacted by the release of



US valuation allowance, partially offset by lower earnings in
    jurisdictions participating in tax holidays, increases in
    valuation allowances on certain foreign net deferred tax assets
    and the effect of new tax legislation in Mexico.

The Company operates under tax holidays in various countries
    which are effective through December 2013. In China, one of the
    Company’s entities has a tax holiday that provided for a
    zero percent tax rate in 2007 and 2008. For 2009 through 2011,
    the Company’s tax rate is 50% of the statutory rate, or
    12.5% based on the 2009 statutory rate of 25%. In Singapore, one
    of the Company’s entities has a tax holiday that provides
    for a zero percent tax rate through 2010. For 2011 through 2013,
    the Company’s tax rate will be 10% based on the current
    statutory rate of 17%. The impact of these tax holidays
    decreased foreign taxes $2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

The Corporate Tax Reform Act of 2008 was signed by the German
    Federal President in August 2007. The Act reduced the
    Company’s combined corporate statutory tax rate from 40% to
    30% while imposing limitations on the deductibility of certain
    expenses, including interest expense. The Company recognized a
    tax benefit of $39 million in 2007 related to the statutory
    rate reduction on its German net deferred tax liabilities.

Mexico enacted the 2008 Fiscal Reform Bill on October 1,
    2007. Effective January 1, 2008, the bill repealed the
    existing asset-based tax and established a dual income tax
    system consisting of a new minimum flat tax (the
    “IETU”) and the existing regular income tax system.
    The IETU system taxes companies on cash basis net income,
    consisting only of certain specified items of revenue and
    expense, at a rate of 16.5%, 17% and 17.5% for 2008, 2009 and
    2010 forward, respectively. In general, companies must pay the
    higher of the income tax or the IETU, although unlike the
    previous asset tax, the IETU is not creditable against future
    income tax liabilities. The Company has determined that it will
    primarily be subject to the IETU in future periods, and as such
    it has recorded tax expense (benefit) of $(5) million,
    $7 million and $20 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, for the tax effects of the IETU system.

On December 7, 2009, Mexico enacted the 2010 Mexican Tax
    Reform Bill (“Tax Reform Bill”) to be effective
    January 1, 2010. Under this new legislation, the corporate
    income tax rate will be temporarily increased from 28% to 30%
    for 2010 through 2012, then reduced to 29% in 2013, and finally
    reduced back to 28% in 2014 and future years. These rate changes
    would impact the Company in the event that it reverts to paying
    taxes on a regular income tax basis versus an IETU basis.
    Further, under current law, income tax loss carryforwards
    reported in the tax consolidation that were not utilized on an
    individual company basis within 10 years were subject to
    recapture. The Tax Reform Bill as enacted accelerates this
    recapture period from 10 years to 5 years and
    effectively requires payment of taxes even if no benefit was
    obtained through the tax consolidation regime. Finally,
    significant modifications were also made to the rules for income
    taxes previously deferred on intercompany dividends, as well as
    to income taxes related to differences between consolidated and
    individual Mexican tax earnings and profits. The estimated
    income tax impact to the Company of this new legislation at
    December 31, 2009 is $73 million, payable
    $12 million in 2010, $14 million in 2012,
    $12 million in 2013 and $35 million in 2014 and
    thereafter.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had US federal net
    operating loss carryforwards of $41 million that are
    subject to limitation. These net operating loss carryforwards
    begin to expire in 2021.

The Company also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards as
    of December 31, 2009 of $1 billion for Luxembourg,
    Canada, China, Germany, Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions
    with various expiration dates. Net operating losses in China
    have various carryforward periods and begin expiring in 2011.
    Net operating losses in Luxembourg, Canada and Germany have no
    expiration date. Net operating losses in Mexico have a ten year
    carryforward period and began to expire in 2009. However, these
    losses are not available for use under the new IETU tax
    regulations in Mexico. As the IETU is the primary system upon
    which the Company will be subject to tax in future periods, no
    deferred tax asset has been reflected in the consolidated
    balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 for these income tax
    loss carryforwards.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Topic

740-10

effective January 1, 2007. FASB ASC Topic

740-10

clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a
    minimum recognition threshold a tax benefit is required to meet
    before being recognized in the financial statements. FASB ASC
    Topic

740-10

also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the
    implementation of FASB ASC Topic

740-10,

the
    Company increased Retained earnings by $14 million and
    decreased Goodwill by $2 million as included in the
    consolidated balance



sheets. In addition, certain tax liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits, as well as related potential penalties and
    interest, were reclassified from current liabilities to
    noncurrent liabilities. Liabilities for unrecognized tax
    benefits as of December 31, 2009 relate to various US and
    foreign jurisdictions.

A reconciliation of the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is
    as follows:

Included in the unrecognized tax benefits as of

    that, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective
    tax rate.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company has recorded a
    liability of $45 million and $38 million,
    respectively, for interest and penalties. This amount includes
    an increase of $7 million and $2 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009, $5 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits are included in current Other liabilities
    (Note 12).

The Company operates in the US (including multiple state
    jurisdictions), Germany and approximately 40 other foreign
    jurisdictions including Canada, China, France, Mexico and
    Singapore. Examinations are ongoing in a number of those
    jurisdictions including, most significantly, in Germany for the
    years 2001 to 2004 and 2005 to 2007. The Company’s US
    federal income tax returns for 2003 and beyond are open for
    examination under statute. The US tax years 2006 to 2008 were
    selected for audit in 2010. Currently, unrecognized tax benefits
    are not expected to change significantly over the next
    12 months.

Stock-Based
    and Other Management Compensation Plans

In December 2004, the Company approved a stock incentive plan
    for executive officers, key employees and directors, a deferred
    compensation plan for executive officers and key employees as
    well as other management incentive programs.

The stock incentive plan allows for the issuance or delivery of
    up to 16,250,000 shares of the Company’s Series A
    common stock through the award of stock options, restricted
    stock units (“RSUs”) and other stock-based awards as
    may be approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee of
    the Board of Directors. At the Company’s discretion under
    the 2004 incentive plan, the Company has the right to award
    dividend equivalents on RSU grants which are earned in
    accordance with the Company’s common stock dividend policy
    and are reinvested in additional RSUs. Dividend equivalents on
    these RSUs are forfeited if vesting conditions are not met.

In April 2009, the Company approved a global incentive plan
    which replaces the Company’s 2004 stock incentive plan. The
    2009 global incentive plan enables the Compensation Committee of
    the Board of Directors to award incentive and nonqualified stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, shares of common stock,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and incentive bonuses
    (which may be paid in cash or stock or a combination thereof),
    any of which may be performance-based, with vesting and other
    award provisions that provide effective incentive to Company
    employees (including officers), non-management directors and
    other service providers. Under the 2009 global incentive plan,
    the company no longer has the option to grant RSUs with the
    right to participate in dividends or dividend equivalents.

The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2009
    global incentive plan is equal to 5,350,000 shares plus
    (a) any shares of Common Stock that remain available for
    issuance under the 2004 stock



incentive plan (not including any shares of Common Stock that
    are subject to outstanding awards under the 2004 stock incentive
    plan or any shares of Common Stock that were issued pursuant to
    awards under the 2004 stock incentive plan) and (b) any
    awards under the 2004 stock incentive plan that remain
    outstanding that cease for any reason to be subject to such
    awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the
    award to the extent that such award is exercised for or settled
    in vested and non-forfeitable shares). As of December 31,
    2009, a total of 3,812,359 shares remained available for
    awards under the 2009 stock incentive plan. A total of 7,185,959
    and 1,481,886 shares were subject to outstanding awards under
    the 2004 stock incentive plan and 2009 global incentive plan,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation

The 2004 deferred compensation plan provides an aggregate
    maximum amount payable of $196 million. The initial
    component of the deferred compensation plan vested in 2004 and
    was paid in the first quarter of 2005. In May 2007, the Original
    Shareholders sold their remaining equity interest in the Company
    triggering an Exit Event, as defined by the plan. Cash
    compensation of $74 million, representing the
    participants’ 2005 and 2006 contingent benefits, was paid
    to the participants during the year ended December 31,
    2007. Participants continuing in the 2004 deferred compensation
    plan (see below for discussion regarding certain
    participant’s decision to participate in a revised program)
    continue to vest in their 2008 and 2009 time-based and
    performance-based entitlements as defined in the deferred
    compensation plan. During the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded compensation expense
    of $1 million, $3 million and $84 million,
    respectively, associated with this plan. As of December 31,
    2009, there was no deferred compensation payable remaining
    associated with this plan.

On April 2, 2007, certain participants in the
    Company’s deferred compensation plan elected to participate
    in a revised program, which includes both cash awards and
    restricted stock units (see Restricted Stock Units below). Under
    the revised program, participants relinquished their cash awards
    of up to $30 million that would have contingently accrued
    from

2007-2009

under the original plan. In lieu of these awards, the revised
    deferred compensation program provides for a future cash award
    in an amount equal to 90% of the maximum potential payout under
    the original plan, plus growth pursuant to one of three
    participant-selected notional investment vehicles, as defined in
    the associated agreements. Participants must remain employed
    through 2010 to vest in the new award. The Company will
    recognize expense through December 31, 2010 and make award
    payments under the revised program in the first quarter of 2011,
    unless participants elect to further defer the payment of their
    individual awards. Based on participation in the revised
    program, the Company expensed $10 million, $8 million
    and $6 million during the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the revised
    program.

In December 2007, the Company adopted a deferred compensation
    plan whereby certain of the Company’s senior employees and
    directors were offered the opportunity to defer a portion of
    their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal
    to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts based upon the
    market performance of specified measurement funds selected by
    the participant. Participants are required to make deferral
    elections under the plan prior to January 1 of the year such
    deferrals will be withheld from their compensation. The Company
    expensed less than $1 million and $1 million during
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    related to this plan.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan

Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted a long-term
    incentive plan (the “LTIP Plan”) which covers certain
    members of management and other key employees of the Company.
    The LTIP Plan is a three-year cash based plan in which awards
    are based on annual and three-year cumulative targets (as
    defined in the LTIP Plan). In February 2007, $26 million
    was paid to the LTIP plan participants. There are no additional
    amounts due under the LTIP Plan.

In December 2008, the Company granted time-vesting cash awards
    of $22 million to the Company’s executive officers and
    certain other key employees. Each award of cash vests 30% on
    October 14, 2009, 30% on October 14, 2010 and 40% on
    October 14, 2011. In its sole discretion, the compensation
    committee of the Board of Directors may at any time convert all
    or a portion of the cash award to an award of time-vesting
    restricted stock units. The liability cash awards are being
    accrued and expensed over the term of the agreements outlined
    above. During the year ended December 31, 2009, less than
    $1 million was paid to participants who left the Company.
    In October



2009, the Company paid cash awards totaling $6 million to
    active employees, representing 30% of the remaining outstanding
    cash awards. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Company expensed $7 million and less than
    $1 million, respectively, related to the cash awards.

Stock
    Options

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan that makes
    awards of stock options to the Company’s executives and
    certain employees. It is the Company’s policy to grant
    options with an exercise price equal to the average of the high
    and low price of the Company’s Series A common stock
    on the grant date. The options issued have a ten-year term and
    vest on a graded basis over periods ranging from one to five
    years. The estimated value of the Company’s stock-based
    awards less expected forfeitures is recognized over the
    awards’ respective vesting period on a straight-line basis.

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the grant
    date using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The weighted
    average assumptions used in the model are outlined in the
    following table:

Year Ended December 31,

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on the
    Company’s historical volatilities. When establishing the
    expected life assumptions, the Company reviews annual historical
    employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting
    periods.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options
    granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
    2007 was $7.46, $16.78, and $14.42, respectively, per option.
    The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was
    $9 million, $27 million, and $84 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    approximately $7 million of total unrecognized compensation
    expense related to stock options, excluding estimated
    forfeitures, to be recognized over the remaining vesting periods
    of the options. Cash received from stock option exercises was
    $14 million, $18 million, and $69 million during
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. There was no tax benefit realized from stock
    option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2009.
    During the year ended December 31, 2008 the Company
    reversed $8 million of the $19 million tax benefit
    that was realized during the year ended December 31, 2007.



During 2009, the Company extended the contractual life of
    4 million fully vested share options held by
    6 employees. As a result of that modification, the Company
    recognized additional compensation expense of $1 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Restricted
    Stock Units (“RSUs”)

Performance-based RSUs.

The Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to the Company’s executive officers
    and certain employees once per year. The Company may also grant
    performance-based RSUs to certain new employees or to employees
    who assume positions of increasing responsibility at the time
    those events occur. The number of performance-based RSUs that
    ultimately vest is dependent on one or both of the following as
    per the terms of the specific award agreement: The achievement
    of 1) internal profitability targets (performance
    condition) and 2) market performance targets measured by
    the comparison of the Company’s stock performance versus a
    defined peer group (market condition).

The performance-based RSUs generally cliff-vest during the
    Company’s quarter-end September 30 black-out period three
    years from the date of grant. The ultimate number of shares of
    the Company’s Series A common stock issued will range
    from zero to stretch, with stretch defined individually under
    each award, net of personal income taxes withheld. The market
    condition is factored into the estimated fair value per unit and
    compensation expense for each award will be based on the
    probability of achieving internal profitability targets, as
    applicable, and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    term of the respective grant, less estimated forfeitures. For
    performance-based RSUs granted without a performance condition,
    compensation expense is based on the fair value per unit
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the grant,
    less estimated forfeitures.

In April 2007, the Company granted performance-based RSUs to
    certain employees that vest annually in equal tranches beginning
    October 1, 2008 through October 1, 2011 and include a
    market condition. The performance-based RSUs awarded include a

catch-up

provision that provides for an additional year of vesting of
    previously unvested amounts, subject to certain maximums.
    Compensation expense is based on the fair value per unit
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the grant,
    less estimated forfeitures.

The fair value of shares vested for performance-based RSUs
    during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
    $2 million and $3 million, respectively. There were no
    vestings that occurred during the year ended December 31,
    2007.

Fair value for the Company’s performance-based RSUs was
    estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation
    approach. Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to randomly
    generate future stock returns for the Company and each company
    in the defined peer group for each grant based on
    company-specific dividend yields, volatilities and stock return
    correlations. These returns were used to calculate future
    performance-based RSU vesting percentages and the simulated
    values of the vested performance-based RSUs were then discounted
    to present value using a risk-free rate, yielding the expected
    value of these performance-based RSUs.



The range of assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation
    approach is outlined in the following table:

Year Ended December 31,




Risk-free interest rate

1.11%

1.05%

20 - 45%

In December 2008, the Company granted 200,000 performance units
    to be settled in cash to the Company’s Chief Executive
    Officer. The terms of the performance units are substantially
    similar to the performance-based RSUs granted in December 2008
    and include a performance condition and a market condition. The
    value of the performance units is equivalent to the value of one
    share of the Company’s Series A common stock and any
    amounts that may vest under the performance unit award agreement
    are to be settled in cash rather than shares of the
    Company’s Series A common stock. The compensation
    committee of the Board of Directors may elect to convert all or
    any portion of the performance units award to an award of an
    equivalent value of performance-based RSUs.

Time-based RSUs.

The Company grants non-employee
    Directors time-based RSUs annually that generally vest one year
    after grant. The fair value of the time-based RSUs is equal to
    the closing price of the Company’s Series A common
    stock on the grant date.

The Company also grants time-based RSUs to the Company’s
    executives and certain employees that vest ratably over time
    intervals ranging from two to four years. The fair value of the
    time-based RSUs is equal to the average of the high and low
    price of the Company’s Series A common stock on the
    grant date.

As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately

    RSUs, excluding estimated forfeitures, which will be amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting periods. The
    fair value of shares vested for time-based RSUs during the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $2 million and
    $1 million, respectively. No RSUs vested during the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the Company’s
    variable rate debt, the Company utilizes interest rate swap
    agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate debt to a
    fixed rate obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are
    designated as cash flow hedges. If an interest rate swap
    agreement is terminated prior to its maturity, the amount
    previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net is recognized into earnings over the period that the
    hedged transaction impacts earnings. If the hedging relationship
    is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted
    transaction will not occur according to the original strategy,
    any related amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net are recognized into earnings
    immediately.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had an interest rate
    swap agreement in place with a notional value of
    $300 million. On March 29, 2007, in connection with
    the April 2007 debt refinancing, the Company terminated this
    interest rate swap agreement and recognized a gain of
    $2 million related to amounts previously recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.

In March 2007, in anticipation of the April 2007 debt
    refinancing, the Company entered into various US dollar and Euro
    interest rate swap agreements, which became effective on
    April 2, 2007, with notional amounts of $1.6 billion
    and €150 million, respectively. The notional amount of
    the $1.6 billion US dollar interest rate swaps decreased by
    $400 million effective January 2, 2008 and decreased
    by another $200 million effective January 2, 2009. To
    offset the declines, the Company entered into US dollar interest
    rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million
    which became effective on January 2, 2008 and an additional
    US dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of
    $200 million which became effective April 2, 2009. The
    notional amount of the interest rate swaps decreased by
    $100 million effective January 4, 2010. No new swaps
    were entered into to offset the declines.

The Company recognized interest (expense) income from hedging
    activities relating to interest rate swaps of
    ($63) million, ($18) million and $6 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The Company recorded a net loss of $0 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 and less than
    $1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007, to Other income (expense), net in the
    consolidated statements of operations for the ineffective
    portion of the interest rate swap agreements. The Company
    recorded an unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate swaps of
    $15 million and ($79) million during the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

Certain entities have receivables and payables denominated in
    currencies other than their respective functional currencies,
    which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into
    foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize its exposure to
    foreign currency fluctuations. Through these instruments, the
    Company mitigates its foreign currency exposure on transactions
    with third party entities as well as intercompany transactions.
    The currently outstanding foreign currency contracts are hedging
    booked exposure, however the Company may from time to time hedge
    its currency exposure related to forecasted transactions.
    Forward contracts are not designated as hedges under FASB ASC
    Topic 815.

The following table indicates the total US dollar equivalents of
    net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign
    exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency. All of the
    contracts included in the table below will have approximately
    offsetting effects from actual underlying payables, receivables,
    intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to
    foreign exchange remeasurement.

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
    a foreign operation, the Company entered into cross currency
    swaps with certain financial institutions in 2004. The cross
    currency swaps and the Euro-denominated portion of the senior
    term loan were designated as a hedge of a net investment of a
    foreign operation. The Company dedesignated the net investment
    hedge due to the debt refinancing in April 2007 and redesignated
    the cross currency swaps and new senior Euro term loan in July
    2007. As a result, the Company recorded $26 million of

mark-to-market

losses related to the cross currency swaps and the new senior
    Euro term loan during this period.

Under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, the
    Company paid approximately €13 million in interest and
    received approximately $16 million in interest on June 15
    and December 15 of each year. The fair value of the net
    obligation under the cross currency swaps was included in
    current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as
    of December 31, 2007. Upon maturity of the cross currency
    swap agreements in June 2008, the Company owed
    €276 million ($426 million) and was owed
    $333 million. In settlement of the obligation, the Company
    paid $93 million (net of interest of $3 million) in
    June 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    dedesignated €385 million of the €400
    Euro-denominated portion of the term loan, previously designated
    as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation. The
    remaining €15 million Euro-denominated portion of the
    term loan was dedesignated as a hedge of a net investment of a
    foreign operation in June 2009. Prior to the dedesignations, the
    Company had been using external derivative contracts to offset
    foreign currency exposures on certain intercompany loans. As a
    result of the dedesignations, the foreign currency exposure
    created by the Euro-denominated term loan is expected to offset
    the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans,
    decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and
    reducing the Company’s exposure to external counterparties.

The effective portion of the gain (loss) on the derivative
    (cross currency swaps) is recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the amount charged to



Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net was
    $0 million, $(19) million and $(19) million,
    respectively. The gain (loss) related to items excluded from the
    assessment of hedge effectiveness of the cross currency swaps
    are recorded to Other income (expense), net in the consolidated
    statements of operations. For the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the amount charged to Other income
    (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations was
    $0 million, $1 million and $(6) million,
    respectively.

Commodity
    Risk Management

The Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its
    procurement of certain raw materials. The Company manages its
    exposure primarily through the use of long-term supply
    agreements and derivative instruments. The Company regularly
    assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity
    requirements forward and utilization of other raw material
    hedging instruments, in addition to forward purchase contracts,
    in accordance with changes in market conditions. Forward
    purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally
    settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity. For
    qualifying contracts, the Company has elected to apply the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception of FASB ASC Topic
    815, as it was probable at the inception and throughout the term
    of the contract that they would not settle net and would result
    in physical delivery. As such, realized gains and losses on
    these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon
    the settlement of the contract.

In addition, the Company occasionally enters into financial
    derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy
    source. Typically, these types of transactions do not qualify
    for hedge accounting. These instruments are marked to market at
    each reporting period and gains (losses) are included in Cost of
    sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company
    recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and less than
    $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. As
    of December 31, 2009, the Company did not have any open
    financial derivative contracts for commodities.

The following table presents information regarding changes in

Fair
    Value Measurements

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted certain
    provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 on January 1, 2008 and
    2009. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tiered fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used
    in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are
    defined as follows:

Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company

Level 2 — inputs that are observable in the
    marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1



Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable in the
    marketplace and significant to the valuation

FASB ASC Topic 820 requires the Company to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
    If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different
    levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized
    based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    fair value calculation.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured
    at fair value on a recurring basis and include marketable
    securities and derivative financial instruments. Marketable
    securities include US government and corporate bonds,
    mortgage-backed securities and equity securities. Derivative
    financial instruments include interest rate swaps and foreign
    currency forwards and swaps.

Marketable Securities.

Where possible, the Company
    utilizes quoted prices in active markets to measure debt and
    equity securities; such items are classified as Level 1 in
    the hierarchy and include equity securities and US government
    bonds. When quoted market prices for identical assets are
    unavailable, varying valuation techniques are used. Common
    inputs in valuing these assets include, among others, benchmark
    yields, issuer spreads, forward mortgage-backed securities trade
    prices and recently reported trades. Such assets are classified
    as Level 2 in the hierarchy and typically include
    mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and other US
    government securities.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

Derivative
    financial instruments are valued in the market using discounted
    cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1
    and Level 2 inputs such as interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the
    discounted cash flow calculation considering the
    instrument’s term, notional amount, discount rate and
    credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for
    interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are
    observable in the active markets and are classified as
    Level 2 in the hierarchy.

In general, the cost investments included in the table above are
    not publicly traded and their fair values are not readily
    determinable; however, the Company believes the carrying values
    approximate or are less than the fair values.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair values of cash
    and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payables, short-term
    debt and the current installments of long-term debt approximate
    carrying values due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. These items have been excluded from the table with
    the exception of the current installments of long-term debt.
    Additionally, certain noncurrent receivables, principally
    insurance recoverables, are carried at net realizable value.

The fair value of long-term debt is based on valuations from
    third-party banks and market quotations.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company is involved in a number of legal and regulatory
    proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal
    conduct of business, relating to such matters as product
    liability, antitrust, intellectual property, workers’
    compensation, prior acquisitions and divestitures, past waste
    disposal practices and release of chemicals into the
    environment. While it is impossible at this time to determine
    with certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims, the Company is actively defending those
    matters where the Company is named as a defendant. Additionally,
    the Company believes, based on the advice of legal counsel, that
    adequate reserves have been made and that the ultimate outcomes
    of all such litigation and claims will not have a material
    adverse effect on the financial position of the Company;
    however, the ultimate outcome of any given matter may have a
    material impact on the results of operations or cash flows of
    the Company in any given reporting period.

Plumbing
    Actions

CNA Holdings LLC. (“CNA Holdings”), a US subsidiary of
    the Company, which included the US business now conducted by the
    Ticona business which is included in the Advanced Engineered
    Materials segment, along with Shell Oil Company
    (“Shell”), E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company
    (“DuPont”) and others, has been a defendant in a
    series of lawsuits, including a number of class actions,
    alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were
    utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential
    property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail.
    Based on, among other things, the findings of outside experts
    and the successful use of Ticona’s acetal copolymer in
    similar applications, CNA Holdings does not believe
    Ticona’s acetal copolymer was defective or caused the
    plumbing systems to fail. In many cases CNA Holdings’
    potential future exposure may be limited by invocation of the
    statute of limitations since CNA Holdings ceased selling the
    resin for use in the plumbing systems in site-built homes during
    1986 and in manufactured homes during 1990.

In November 1995, CNA Holdings, DuPont and Shell entered into
    national class action settlements that called for the
    replacement of plumbing systems of claimants who have had
    qualifying leaks, as well as reimbursements for certain leak
    damage. In connection with such settlement, the three companies
    had agreed to fund these replacements and reimbursements up to
    an aggregate amount of $950 million. As of
    December 31, 2009, the aggregate funding is
    $1,109 million, due to additional contributions and funding
    commitments made primarily by other parties.

During the period between 1995 and 2001, CNA Holdings was also
    named as a defendant in the following putative class actions:

•

Cox, et al. v. Hoechst Celanese
    Corporation, et al.

,

No. 94-0047

(Chancery Ct., Obion County, Tennessee) (class was certified).

•

Couture, et al. v. Shell Oil
    Company, et al.

,

(Quebec Superior Court, Canada).

•

Dilday, et al. v. Hoechst
    Celanese Corporation, et al.

, No. 15187 (Chancery Ct.,
    Weakley County, Tennessee).

•

Furlan v. Shell Oil
    Company, et al.

, No. C967239 (British Columbia Supreme
    Court, Vancouver Registry, Canada).

•

Gariepy, et al. v. Shell Oil
    Company, et al.

, No. 30781/99 (Ontario Court General
    Division, Canada).



•

Shelter General Insurance Co.,
    et al. v. Shell Oil Company, et al.

, No. 16809
    (Chancery Ct., Weakley County, Tennessee).

•

St. Croix Ltd., et al. v.
    Shell Oil Company, et al.

, No. 1997/467 (Territorial
    Ct., St. Croix Division, the US Virgin Islands).

•

Tranter v. Shell Oil
    Company, et al.

, No. 46565/97 (Ontario Court General
    Division, Canada).

In addition, between 1994 and 2008 CNA Holdings was named as a
    defendant in numerous

non-class

actions filed in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
    Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, the US Virgin
    Islands and Canada of which ten are currently pending. In all of
    these actions, the plaintiffs have sought recovery for alleged
    damages caused by leaking polybutylene plumbing. Damage amounts
    have generally not been specified but these cases generally do
    not involve (either individually or in the aggregate) a large
    number of homes.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had remaining accruals
    of $55 million, of which $1 million is included in
    current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company had remaining accruals of
    $64 million, of which $2 million was included in
    current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company reached settlements with CNA Holdings’ insurers
    specifying their responsibility for these claims. During the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the Company received
    $23 million of insurance proceeds from various CNA
    Holdings’ insurers as full satisfaction for their
    responsibility for these claims. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company received less than
    $1 million from insurers. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company recognized a $9 million
    decrease in legal reserves for plumbing claims due to the
    Company’s ongoing assessment of the likely outcome of the
    plumbing actions and the expiration of the statute of limitation.

Plumbing
    Insurance Indemnifications

Celanese GmbH entered into agreements with insurance companies
    related to product liability settlements associated with
    Celcon

®

plumbing claims. These agreements, except those with insolvent
    insurance companies, require the Company to indemnify

and/or

defend these insurance companies in the event that third parties
    seek additional monies for matters released in these agreements.
    The indemnifications in these agreements do not provide for time
    limitations.

In certain of the agreements, Celanese GmbH received a fixed
    settlement amount. The indemnities under these agreements
    generally are limited to, but in some cases are greater than,
    the amount received in settlement from the insurance company.
    The maximum exposure under these indemnifications is
    $95 million. Other settlement agreements have no stated
    limits.

There are other agreements whereby the settling insurer agreed
    to pay a fixed percentage of claims that relate to that
    insurer’s policies. The Company has provided
    indemnifications to the insurers for amounts paid in excess of
    the settlement percentage. These indemnifications do not provide
    for monetary or time limitations.

Sorbates
    Antitrust Actions

In May 2002, the European Commission informed Hoechst AG
    (“Hoechst”) of its intent to officially investigate
    the sorbates industry. In early January 2003, the European
    Commission served Hoechst, Nutrinova, Inc., a US subsidiary of
    Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients
    GmbH and previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoechst
    (“Nutrinova”), and a number of competitors of
    Nutrinova with a statement of objections alleging unlawful,
    anticompetitive behavior affecting the European sorbates market.
    In October 2003, the European Commission ruled that Hoechst,
    Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd.
    (“Daicel”), The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co.
    Ltd. and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd. operated a cartel in
    the European sorbates market between 1979 and 1996. The European
    Commission imposed a total fine of €138 million on
    such companies, of which €99 million was assessed
    against Hoechst and its legal successors. The case against
    Nutrinova was closed. Pursuant to the Demerger Agreement with
    Hoechst, Celanese GmbH was assigned the obligation related to
    the sorbates antitrust matter; however, Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, agreed to indemnify Celanese GmbH for 80% of any
    costs Celanese GmbH incurred relative to this matter.
    Accordingly, Celanese GmbH



recognized a receivable from Hoechst from this indemnification.
    In June 2008, the Court of First Instance of the European
    Communities (Fifth Chamber) reduced the fine against Hoechst to
    €74.25 million and in July 2008, Hoechst paid the
    €74.25 million fine. In August 2008, the Company paid
    Hoechst €17 million, including interest of
    €2 million, in satisfaction of its 20% obligation with
    respect to the fine.

Based on the advice of external counsel and a review of the
    existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates
    antitrust matters, including the settlement of the European
    Union’s investigation, as well as civil claims filed and
    settled, the Company released its accruals related to the
    settled sorbates antitrust matters and the indemnification
    receivables resulting in a gain of $8 million, net,
    included in Other (charges) gains, net, in the consolidated
    statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

In addition, in 2004 a civil antitrust action styled

Freeman
    Industries LLC v. Eastman Chemical Co., et. al.

was
    filed against Hoechst and Nutrinova, Inc. in the Law Court for
    Sullivan County in Kingsport, Tennessee. The plaintiff sought
    monetary damages and other relief for alleged conduct involving
    the sorbates industry. The trial court dismissed the
    plaintiff’s claims and upon appeal the Supreme Court of
    Tennessee affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims.
    In December 2005, the plaintiff lost an attempt to amend its
    complaint and the entire action was dismissed with prejudice.
    Plaintiff’s counsel subsequently filed a new complaint with
    new class representatives in the District Court of the District
    of Tennessee. The Company’s motion to strike the class
    allegations was granted in April 2008 and the plaintiff’s
    request to appeal the ruling remains pending.

Polyester
    Staple Antitrust Litigation

CNA Holdings, the successor in interest to Hoechst Celanese
    Corporation (“HCC”), Celanese Americas Corporation and
    Celanese GmbH (collectively, the “Celanese Entities”)
    and Hoechst, the former parent of HCC, were named as defendants
    in two actions (involving 25 individual participants) filed in
    September 2006 by US purchasers of polyester staple fibers
    manufactured and sold by HCC. The actions allege that the
    defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids
    and allocate customers of polyester staple sold in the United
    States. These actions were consolidated in a proceeding by a
    Multi-District Litigation Panel in the United States District
    Court for the Western District of North Carolina styled

In re
    Polyester Staple Antitrust Litigation

, MDL 1516. On
    June 12, 2008 the court dismissed these actions against all
    Celanese Entities in consideration of a payment by the Company
    of $107 million. This proceeding related to sales by the
    polyester staple fibers business which Hoechst sold to KoSa,
    Inc. in 1998. Accordingly, the impact of this settlement is
    reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations. The Company also previously entered
    into tolling arrangements with four other alleged US purchasers
    of polyester staple fibers manufactured and sold by the Celanese
    Entities. These purchasers were not included in the settlement
    and one such company filed suit against the Company in December
    2008 in the Western District of North Carolina entitled

Milliken & Company v. CNA Holdings, Inc.,
    Celanese Americas Corporation and Hoechst AG

(No. 8-CV-00578).

The Company is actively defending this matter.

In 1998, HCC sold its polyester staple business as part of the
    sale of its Film & Fibers Division to KoSa B.V., f/k/a
    Arteva B.V. and a subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc.
    (“KoSa”). In March 2001 the US Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) commenced an investigation of possible price
    fixing regarding sales in the US of polyester staple fibers
    after the period the Celanese Entities were engaged in the
    polyester staple fiber business. The Celanese Entities were
    never named in these DOJ actions. As a result of the DOJ action,
    during August of 2002, Arteva Specialties, S.a.r.l., a
    subsidiary of KoSa, (“Arteva Specialties”) pled guilty
    to criminal violation of the Sherman Act related to
    anti-competitive conduct occurring after the 1998 sale of the
    polyester staple fiber business and paid a fine of
    $29 million. In a complaint pending against the Celanese
    Entities and Hoechst in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of New York, Koch Industries, Inc., KoSa,
    Arteva Specialties and Arteva Services S.a.r.l. seek damages in
    excess of $371 million that includes indemnification for
    all damages related to the defendants’ alleged
    participation in, and failure to disclose, the alleged
    conspiracy during due diligence. The Company is actively
    defending this matter.



Acetic
    Acid Patent Infringement Matters

On May 9, 1999, Celanese International Corporation filed a
    private criminal action styled

Celanese International
    Corporation v. China Petrochemical Development Corporation

against China Petrochemical Development Corporation
    (“CPDC”) in the Taiwan Kaoshiung District Court
    alleging that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s patent covering the manufacture of acetic
    acid. Celanese International Corporation also filed a
    supplementary civil brief that, in view of changes in Taiwanese
    patent laws, was subsequently converted to a civil action
    alleging damages against CPDC based on a period of infringement
    of ten years,

1991-2000,

and based on CPDC’s own data that was reported to the
    Taiwanese securities and exchange commission. Celanese
    International Corporation’s patent was held valid by the
    Taiwanese patent office. On August 31, 2005, the District
    Court held that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s acetic acid patent and awarded Celanese
    International Corporation approximately $28 million (plus
    interest) for the period of 1995 through 1999. In October 2008,
    the High Court, on appeal, reversed the District Court’s
    $28 million award to the Company. The Company appealed to
    the Superior Court in November 2008, and the court remanded the
    case to the Intellectual Property Court on June 4, 2009. On
    January 16, 2006, the District Court awarded Celanese
    International Corporation $800,000 (plus interest) for the year
    1990. In January 2009, the High Court, on appeal, affirmed the
    District Court’s award and CPDC appealed on
    February 5, 2009 to the Supreme Court. On June 29,
    2007, the District Court awarded Celanese International
    Corporation $60 million (plus interest) for the period of
    2000 through 2005. CPDC appealed this ruling and on
    July 21, 2009, the High Court ruled in CPDC’s favor.
    The Company appealed to the Supreme Court and in December 2009,
    the case was remanded to the Intellectual Property Court.

Asbestos
    Claims

As of December 31, 2009, Celanese Ltd. and/or CNA Holdings,
    Inc., both US subsidiaries of the Company, are defendants in
    approximately 526 asbestos cases. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, 56 new cases were filed against the
    Company, 90 cases were resolved, and 1 case was added after
    further analysis by outside counsel. Because many of these cases
    involve numerous plaintiffs, the Company is subject to claims
    significantly in excess of the number of actual cases. The
    Company has reserves for defense costs related to claims arising
    from these matters. The Company believes that there is no
    material exposure related to these matters.

Domination
    Agreement

On October 1, 2004, a Domination Agreement between Celanese
    GmbH and the Purchaser became operative. When the Domination
    Agreement became operative, the Purchaser became obligated to
    offer to acquire all outstanding Celanese GmbH shares from the
    minority shareholders of Celanese GmbH in return for payment of
    fair cash compensation. The amount of this fair cash
    compensation was determined to be €41.92 per share, plus
    interest, in accordance with applicable German law. Until the
    Squeeze-Out was registered in the commercial register in Germany
    on December 22, 2006, any minority shareholder who elected
    not to sell its shares to the Purchaser was entitled to remain a
    shareholder of Celanese GmbH and to receive from the Purchaser a
    gross guaranteed annual payment on its shares of €3.27 per
    Celanese GmbH share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any
    dividend.

The Domination Agreement was terminated by the Purchaser in the
    ordinary course of business effective December 31, 2009.
    The Company’s subsidiaries, CIH and Celanese US, have each
    agreed to provide the Purchaser with financing to strengthen the
    Purchaser’s ability to fulfill its obligations under, or in
    connection with, the Domination Agreement and to ensure that the
    Purchaser will perform all of its obligations under, or in
    connection with, the Domination Agreement when such obligations
    become due, including, without limitation, the obligation to
    compensate Celanese GmbH for any statutory annual loss incurred
    by Celanese GmbH during the term of the Domination Agreement. If
    CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under such guarantees
    or other security to the Purchaser, the Company may not have
    sufficient funds for payments on its indebtedness when due. The
    Company has not had to compensate Celanese GmbH for an annual
    loss for any period during which the Domination Agreement has
    been in effect. Due to the termination of the Domination
    Agreement there will be no obligation by the Purchaser to
    compensate Celanese GmbH for any losses incurred after
    December 31, 2009.



Award
    Proceedings in relation to Domination Agreement and Squeeze
    Out

The amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement as well as
    the Squeeze-Out compensation are under court review in two
    separate special award proceedings. The amounts of the fair cash
    compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under
    the Domination Agreement may be increased in special award
    proceedings initiated by minority shareholders, which may
    further reduce the funds the Purchaser can otherwise make
    available to the Company. As of March 30, 2005, several
    minority shareholders of Celanese GmbH had initiated special
    award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts
    of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual
    payment offered under the Domination Agreement. As a result of
    these proceedings, the amount of the fair cash consideration and
    the guaranteed annual payment offered under the Domination
    Agreement could be increased by the court so that all minority
    shareholders, including those who have already tendered their
    shares into the mandatory offer and have received the fair cash
    compensation could claim the respective higher amounts. The
    court dismissed all of these proceedings in March 2005 on the
    grounds of inadmissibility. Thirty-three plaintiffs appealed the
    dismissal, and in January 2006, twenty-three of these appeals
    were granted by the court. They were remanded back to the court
    of first instance, where the valuation will be further reviewed.
    On December 12, 2006, the court of first instance appointed
    an expert to help determine the value of Celanese GmbH. In the
    first quarter of 2007, certain minority shareholders that
    received €66.99 per share as fair cash compensation also
    filed award proceedings challenging the amount they received as
    fair cash compensation.

The Company received applications for the commencement of award
    proceedings filed by 79 shareholders against the Purchaser
    with the Frankfurt District Court requesting the court to set a
    higher amount for the Squeeze-Out compensation. The motions are
    based on various alleged shortcomings and mistakes in the
    valuation of Celanese GmbH done for purposes of the Squeeze-Out.
    On May 11, 2007, the court of first instance appointed a
    common representative for those shareholders that have not filed
    an application on their own.

Should the court set a higher value for the Squeeze-Out
    compensation, former Celanese GmbH shareholders who ceased to be
    shareholders of Celanese GmbH due to the Squeeze-Out are
    entitled, pursuant to a settlement agreement between the
    Purchaser and certain former Celanese GmbH shareholders, to
    claim for their shares the higher of the compensation amounts
    determined by the court in these different proceedings. Payments
    these shareholders already received as compensation for their
    shares will be offset so that those shareholders who ceased to
    be shareholders of Celanese GmbH due to the Squeeze-Out are not
    entitled to more than the higher of the amount set in the two
    court proceedings.

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties
    for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of
    agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements,
    leases, settlement agreements and various agreements with
    affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, others do not provide such limitations.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the occurrence of
    unpredictable future events, the future costs associated with
    them cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably
    estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims
    that have been brought to its attention. These known obligations
    include the following:

•
    Demerger Obligations

The Company has obligations to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, for various liabilities under the Demerger
    Agreement, including for environmental liabilities associated
    with contamination arising under 19 divestiture agreements
    entered into by Hoechst prior to the demerger.

The Company’s obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, is subject to the following thresholds:

•    The Company will indemnify
    Hoechst, and its legal successors, against those liabilities up
    to €250 million;



•    Hoechst, and its legal successors,
    will bear those liabilities exceeding €250 million,
    however the Company will reimburse Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, for one-third of those liabilities for amounts that
    exceed €750 million in the aggregate.

The aggregate maximum amount of environmental indemnifications
    under the remaining divestiture agreements that provide for
    monetary limits is approximately €750 million. Three
    of the divestiture agreements do not provide for monetary limits.

Based on the estimate of the probability of loss under this
    indemnification, the Company had reserves of $32 million
    and $27 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, for this contingency. Where the Company is unable
    to reasonably determine the probability of loss or estimate such
    loss under an indemnification, the Company has not recognized
    any related liabilities.

The Company has also undertaken in the Demerger Agreement to
    indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for liabilities that
    Hoechst is required to discharge, including tax liabilities,
    which are associated with businesses that were included in the
    demerger but were not demerged due to legal restrictions on the
    transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for
    any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not provided
    for any reserves associated with this indemnification as it is
    not probable or estimable. The Company has not made any payments
    to Hoechst or its legal successors during the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection
    with this indemnification.

•
    Divestiture Obligations

The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify
    third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for
    various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also
    include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust
    and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees
    represent standard contractual terms associated with typical
    divestiture agreements and, other than environmental
    liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the
    Company to any significant risk. As of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the Company has reserves in the aggregate of
    $32 million and $33 million, respectively, for these
    matters.

The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and
    facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or
    guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, ranging from one year to thirty years. The
    aggregate amount of guarantees provided for under these
    agreements is approximately $1.9 billion as of
    December 31, 2009. Other agreements do not provide for any
    monetary or time limitations.

Purchase
    Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    commitments to purchase goods and services over a fixed period
    of time. The Company maintains a number of

“take-or-pay”

contracts for purchases of raw materials and utilities. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were outstanding future
    commitments of $1,626 million under

take-or-pay

contracts. The Company recognized $17 million of losses
    related to

take-or-pay

contract termination costs for the year ended December 31,
    2009 related to the Company’s Pardies, France Project of
    Closure (see Note 18). The Company does not expect to incur
    any material losses under

take-or-pay

contractual arrangements unrelated to the Pardies, France
    Project of Closure. Additionally, as of December 31, 2009,
    there were other outstanding commitments of $713 million
    representing maintenance and service agreements, energy and
    utility agreements, consulting contracts and software agreements.

Ticona
    Kelsterbach Plant Relocation

In November 2006, the Company finalized a settlement agreement
    with the Frankfurt, Germany, Airport (“Fraport”) to
    relocate the Kelsterbach, Germany Ticona business, included in
    the Advanced Engineered Materials segment, resolving several
    years of legal disputes related to the planned Fraport
    expansion. As a result of the settlement, the Company will
    transition Ticona’s operations from Kelsterbach to the
    Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine Main area in Germany by
    mid-2011. Under the original agreement, Fraport agreed to pay
    Ticona a total of €670 million over a five-year period
    to offset the costs associated with the transition of the
    business from its current location and the closure of the
    Kelsterbach plant. In February 2009, the Company announced the
    Fraport supervisory board approved the acceleration of the 2009
    and 2010 payments of €200 million and
    €140 million, respectively, required by the settlement
    agreement signed in June 2007. In February 2009, the Company
    received a



discounted amount of €322 million ($412 million)
    under this agreement. In addition, the Company received
    €59 million ($75 million) in value-added tax from
    Fraport which was remitted to the tax authorities in April 2009.
    In June 2008, the Company received €200 million
    ($311 million) from Fraport under this agreement. Amounts
    received from Fraport are accounted for as deferred proceeds and
    are included in noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Insurance
    Recoveries

In May 2007, the Company announced that it had an unplanned
    outage at its Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid facility. At that
    time, the Company originally expected the outage to last until
    the end of May. Upon restart of the facility, additional
    operating issues were identified which necessitated an extension
    of the outage for further, more extensive repairs. In July 2007,
    the Company announced that the further repairs were unsuccessful
    on restart of the unit. All repairs were completed in early
    August 2007 and normal production capacity resumed. During the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    recorded $6 million and $38 million, respectively, of
    insurance recoveries from its reinsurers in partial satisfaction
    of claims that the Company made based on losses resulting from
    the outage. These insurances recoveries are included in Other
    (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of
    operations (Note 18).

In October 2008, the Company declared force majeure on its
    specialty polymers products produced at its EVA Performance
    Polymers facility in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada as a result of
    certain events and subsequent cessation of production. The
    Company replaced damaged long-lived assets during 2009. Any
    contingent liabilities associated with the outage may be
    mitigated by the Company’s insurance policies.

31.

Subsequent
    Events

On January 5, 2010, the Company declared a cash dividend of
    $0.265625 per share on its Preferred Stock amounting to
    $3 million and a cash dividend of $0.04 per share on its
    Series A common stock amounting to $6 million. Both
    cash dividends are for the period from November 2, 2009 to
    January 31, 2010 and were paid on February 1, 2010 to
    holders of record as of January 15, 2010.

On February 1, 2010, the Company announced it would elect
    to redeem all of the Company’s 9,600,000 outstanding shares
    of its Preferred Stock on February 22, 2010
    (“Redemption Date”). On that date, each of the
    Preferred Stock will be redeemed for a number of shares of the
    Company’s Series A common stock equal to the
    redemption price ($25.06) divided by 97.5% of the average
    closing price of the Company’s Series A common stock
    for the 10 trading days ending on the fifth trading day prior to
    February 22, 2010.

Holders of the Preferred Stock also have the right to convert
    their shares at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City
    time, on February 19, 2010, the business day immediately
    preceding the Redemption Date. Holders who want to convert
    their shares of Preferred Stock must satisfy all of the
    requirements as defined in the Certificate of Designations prior
    to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, in order to effect
    conversion of their shares of Preferred Stock. Each share of
    Preferred Stock is convertible into 1.2600 shares of the
    Company’s Series A common stock, subject to adjustment
    under certain circumstances as set forth in the Certificates of
    Designations.

Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of
    issuance, February 12, 2010.
