We have a substantial portfolio of affiliates in various regions, including Asia-Pacific, North America and the Middle East. These affiliates, some of which date back as far as the 1960s, have sizeable operations and are significant within their industries.

Our strategic affiliates have similar business models as our core businesses. With shared characteristics such as products, applications and manufacturing technology, these strategic affiliates complement and extend our technology and specialty materials portfolio. We have historically entered into these investments to gain access to local demand, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant future business potential. Depending on the level of investment and other factors, we account for our strategic affiliates using either the equity method or cost method of accounting.

Our strategic affiliates contribute substantial earnings and cash flows to Celanese. During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, our equity method strategic affiliates generated combined sales of $2.4 billion, resulting in our recording

$150 million

of equity in net earnings of affiliates and

$136 million

of dividends.



Our strategic affiliates

as of

December 31, 2015

are as follows:

National Methanol Company (Ibn Sina).

National Methanol Company represents approximately 1% of the world's methanol production capacity and is one of the world's largest producers of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, a gasoline additive. Its production facilities are located in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Basic Industries Corporation ("SABIC") is responsible for all product marketing. Methanol is a key feedstock for POM production and is produced by our Ibn Sina affiliate which provides an economic hedge against raw material costs in our engineered materials business.

Ibn Sina is currently constructing a 50,000 ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia. The new facility will supply POM to support Advanced Engineered Materials' future growth plans as well as our venture partners' regional business development. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, which is expected to occur in 2017, our indirect economic interest in Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to 32.5%. SABIC's economic interest will remain unchanged.

Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd.

KEPCO is the leading producer of POM in South Korea. KEPCO has polyacetal production facilities in Ulsan, South Korea, compounding facilities for PBT and nylon in Pyongtaek, South Korea, and participates with Polyplastics and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM facility in Nantong, China.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd.

Polyplastics is a leading supplier of engineered plastics. Polyplastics is a manufacturer and/or marketer of POM, LCP and PPS, with principal production facilities located in Japan and Malaysia.

Fortron Industries LLC.

Fortron is a leading global producer of PPS, sold under the Fortron

®

brand, which is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications, especially those requiring heat and/or chemical resistance. Fortron's facility is located in Wilmington, North Carolina. This venture combines the sales, marketing, distribution, compounding and manufacturing expertise of Celanese with the PPS polymer technology expertise of Kureha America Inc.

Cellulose derivatives strategic ventures.

Our cellulose derivatives ventures generally fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay dividends based on each ventures' performance in the preceding year. In


,


and


, we received cash dividends of

$106 million

,

$115 million

and

$92 million

, respectively.

Although our ownership interest in each of our cellulose derivatives ventures exceeds 20%, we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on our involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP").

Other Equity Method Investments

InfraServs.

We hold indirect ownership interests in several German InfraServ Groups that own and develop industrial parks and provide on-site general and administrative support to tenants. Our ownership interest in the equity investments in InfraServ affiliates are as follows:

Research and Development

Our businesses are innovation-oriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications. Research and development expense was

$119 million

,

$86 million

and

$85 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively. We consider the amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be sufficient to execute our current strategic initiatives.

Intellectual Property

We attach importance to protecting our intellectual property, including safeguarding our confidential information and through our patents, trademarks and copyrights, in order to preserve our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Patents may cover processes, equipment, products, intermediate products and product uses. We also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our Company and products.

Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of net sales or financial performance.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Many factors could have an effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results

of operations. We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic,

environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions. The factors

described below represent our principal risks.

Risks Related to Our Business

We are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general

economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we

have operations and customers.

We operate globally and have customers in many countries. Our major facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe and Asia, and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the US, Germany, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by world economic conditions, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment.

Our operations are also subject to global political conditions. In certain foreign jurisdictions, our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. In certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings, such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies.

Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines, penalties and other costs. Moreover, changes in laws or regulations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements (including import or export licensing requirements), or changes in reporting requirements of the US, Canadian, Mexican, German, European Union ("EU") or Asian governmental agencies, could increase the cost of doing business in these regions. Any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities, including our stock.

We have invested significant resources in China and other Asian countries. This region's growth may slow, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and, consequently, our financial results may be adversely impacted.

In addition, we have significant operations and financial relationships based in Europe. Historically sales originating in Europe have accounted for over one-third of our net sales and approximately 40% in


. Adverse conditions in the European economy may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting decreased end-use customer demand.

Finally, conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war, terrorist activities, civil unrest, epidemics, pandemics, weather, natural disasters, the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate or have significant customers or suppliers could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products, as well as increasing security costs, insurance premiums and other expenses. These conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the US, Europe, Asia or elsewhere.

We are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and

availability of key raw materials and energy, which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results.

We purchase significant amounts of ethylene, methanol, carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in the Acetyl Intermediates segment, principally acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer ("VAM") and formaldehyde. We use a portion of our output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in the production of downstream products in all our business segments. We also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our Industrial Specialties segment, primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production, as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in our Consumer Specialties segment. The price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of natural disasters, plant or production disruptions, strikes or other labor unrest, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities, or changes in laws or regulations. In particular, to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals, shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals, such as natural gas, ethylene and methanol, or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide,



may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products. Such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results.

We are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy. Although we have long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene, methanol, carbon monoxide, wood pulp, natural gas and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile. In addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price, factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include:

•

Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from growing uses or new uses;

•

Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, labor disruption, involuntary shutdowns or turnarounds;

•

The inability of a supplier to meet our delivery orders or a supplier's choice not to fulfill orders or to terminate a supply contract or our inability to obtain or renew supply contracts on favorable terms;

•

The general level of business and economic activity; and

•

The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation (including the impact of government regulation relating to climate change).

If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs, or if such commodities become unavailable, it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results.

We have a practice of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services. However, some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials, such as carbon monoxide, steam and ethylene, or services. Although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services, there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service, there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier. Furthermore, if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time, we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative, and any such alternative could result in increased costs. It is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier.

A portion of our supply of methanol in North America is currently obtained from our joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC ("Fairway"), with Mitsui & Co., Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan, in which we own a 50% interest, for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. Fairway began production in October 2015.

Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of

reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our

sales and satisfy our customers' demands.

A disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, disease, strikes or other labor unrest, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers' needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. In particular, production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments, such as acetic acid, VAM and formaldehyde, could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration. Furthermore, to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption.



Failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement

productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive

position.

Our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products, product grades and applications, as well as process technologies, free of any legal restrictions. If we are unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and production processes in the future, including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our Advanced Engineered Materials segment, our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected. However, as we invest in new technology, we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties, including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals, the development of competing technologies, failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations, construction delays, cost over-runs, the unavailability of financing, required materials or equipment and various other factors. Likewise, we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings. These initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls, which

could adversely affect our financial condition and performance.

The development, manufacture and sales of specialty chemical products by us, including products produced for the food and beverage, cigarette, automobile, aerospace, medical device and pharmaceutical industries, involve a risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. A product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in our products, and divert management's attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Although we have standard contracting policies and controls, we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls.

We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications.

Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers' products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers.

Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual

property rights. Our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our

ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins.

We rely on our patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products. We have adopted internal policies for protecting our know-how and trade secrets. In addition, our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses. Patents may cover catalysts, processes, products, intermediate products and product uses. These patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application. The legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection. As patents expire, the catalysts, processes and products described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated know-how and trade secrets. We also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired. We operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions with similar challenges. If we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property rights, our net sales, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.



Our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our

suppliers, customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers, customers and business partners

participate are cyclical in nature, both of which may adversely affect

our business and results of operations.

Some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries, are highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use applications, and may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. Our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers' products. These risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. In addition, many of these industries are cyclical in nature, thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition.

Environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters

could subject us to liability for fines, clean-ups and other damages, require

us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing

and delivery costs.

Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us, may have a significant negative impact on our operating results. We also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between Celanese GmbH and Hoechst AG for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger.

Our operations are subject to extensive international, national, state, local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters. We incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements. If we violate any one of those laws or regulations, we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions, including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations. Consequently, compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period. See

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources

for further information.

Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we

manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our

products.

New or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health, safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products. In addition, products we produce, including VAM, formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde, may be classified in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products. For example, the International Agency for Research on Cancer ("IARC"), a private research agency, classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer in humans. In addition, several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points, including leukemia. In October 2009, IARC concluded that there is sufficient evidence of a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia. In 2011, the National Toxicology Program ("NTP") released the 12th report on carcinogens, which changed the classification of formaldehyde from "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen" to "known to be a human carcinogen". Similar to the IARC modification in 2009, the NTP report also implicates formaldehyde as a leukemogen. We anticipate that the results of the IARC's and the NTP's reviews will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements.

Other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives include the Voluntary Children's Chemical Evaluation Program, High Production Volume Chemical Initiative and expected modifications to the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") in the US, as well as various European Commission programs, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"), as well as new initiatives in Asia and other regions. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.



Our production facilities, including facilities we own and/or operate, handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous

materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our

operating results.

Our operations are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing, including the storage and transportation of raw materials, finished products and waste. These risks include, among other things, pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances.

These operating and other risks can cause personal injury, property damage, third-party damages and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, our operating results and cash flows.

US federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production

plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future, if passed

into law, may increase

our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations.

The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program ("CFATS Program"), which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the US. In December 2014, the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 ("CFATS Act") was enacted. The CFATS Act reauthorizes the CFATS Program for four years. DHS has released an interim final rule under the CFATS Program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for high-risk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest. This rule establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of our nation's chemical facilities. It requires covered chemical facilities to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments, which identify facility security vulnerabilities, and to develop and implement Site Security Plans, which include measures that satisfy the identified risk-based performance standards. We cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that DHS may require.

We are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation,

regulation and international accords.

Future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible, which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs. Greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future US treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act or new climate change legislation. Cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the EU. While not all are likely to become law, many countries are considering or have implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and

regulatory proceedings.

We are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period. See

Note 16 - Environmental

and

Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Changes in, or the interpretation of, tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results.

Our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world. In particular, proposed US tax legislation could materially impact our results. Currently, the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the US, and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the US. If these funds are needed for our operations in the US, we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs.



We have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most non-US subsidiaries, because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense, which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities. Currently, there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental US taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings. As a result, we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations.

Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, expirations of tax holidays or rulings, changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. We are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. Examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. It is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

Our significant non-US operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that

could adversely impact our profitability.

We conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the US. Consequently, fluctuations in currencies of other countries, especially the Euro, may materially affect our operating results. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into US dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. Therefore, increases or decreases in value of the US dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions. These changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors.

In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary's functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the US dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively.

We use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures. We cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective. In addition, the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk. Failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business.

We have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats. While some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs, we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business. We seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, mis-use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position, cause operational disruption, reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees', customers' or vendors' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including monitoring of our systems and networks, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business. In addition, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results.



Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the

identification and development of talent to succeed senior management.

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and we rely heavily on our management team. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of our reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies.

Significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to

pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations,

the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost.

The cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time. Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions, which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations. The combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. In recent years, an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates. If the funded status of a pension plan declines, we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned.

Some of our employees are unionized, represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the US.

As of

December 31, 2015

, we had

7,081

employees. Approximately

18%

of our

2,660

US-based employees are unionized. At the largest union site, Narrows, Virginia, we successfully concluded contract negotiations on a three year contract in April 2014. This contract settled without any labor dispute or unrest. We announced the closing of our other US-based union site, Meredosia, Illinois, in October 2015. Unionized employees began departing the site in December 2015, and we anticipate that a majority of all employees will have departed the site by the end of the first quarter of 2016. We have conducted the required "effects bargaining" negotiations with the union and an agreement was reached on severance and other benefits without a labor dispute.

In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the US. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements. Most of our employees in Europe are represented by workers councils and/or unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment, including potentially salaries and benefits. They may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown by our employees could occur, resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as any stockholders' rights plan, may discourage a takeover attempt.

Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our Series A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock"). These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our Company. In addition, a change of control of our Company may be delayed or deterred as a result of any stockholders' rights plan that our Board of Directors may adopt. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.



We may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility.

We periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility. We also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised, we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations. The closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant. See

Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future

acquisitions into our business, which could adversely affect our business or results

of operations.

As part of our growth strategy, we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities. Successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulty determining appropriate valuation, integrating operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired lines or businesses, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business matters. In addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame that we anticipate, or at all, which could adversely affect our business or results of operations.

The insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks.

We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In the future, the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost.

Differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans, which may adversely affect our results of operations.

We currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties. Differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to

fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the

chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our

indebtedness.

See

Note 14 - Debt

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness. See

Note 13 - Noncurrent Other Liabilities

,

Note 15 - Benefit Obligations

and

Note 16 - Environmental

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations.

Our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences, including:

•

Increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including exacerbating the impact of any adverse business effects that are determined to be material adverse events under our existing senior credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") or our indentures (the "Indentures") governing our

€300 million

in aggregate principal amount of

3.250%

senior unsecured notes due 2019,

$400 million

in aggregate principal amount of

5.875%

senior unsecured notes due 2021 and

$500 million

in aggregate principal amount of

4.625%

senior unsecured notes due 2022 (collectively, the "Senior Notes");

•

Requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness and amounts payable in connection with the satisfaction of our other liabilities, therefore reducing our ability



to use our cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends on our Common Stock;

•

Exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

Exposing us to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates as certain of our borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies;

•

Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;

•

Limiting our ability to enter into certain commercial arrangements because of concerns of counterparty risks; and

•

Limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.

We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could increase

the risks described above.

Although covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our debt described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, including the Senior Notes, would increase.

Our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, which could cause

our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating

results.

Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated, which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk, respectively. See

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

below and

Note 22 - Derivative Financial Instruments

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may

be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness, which

may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in

certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our

indebtedness or pay dividends.

The Amended Credit Agreement, the Indentures and the Receivables Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. The Amended Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet this test at all.

The Amended Credit Agreement also contains covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make



investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions or hedge transactions; or engage in other businesses.

In addition, the Indentures limit Celanese US's and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional debt; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; consummate specified asset sales; enter into transactions with affiliates; incur liens, impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments to Celanese US and its restricted subsidiaries; merge or consolidate with any other person; and sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Celanese US's assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries.

The Purchase Agreement also contains covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on CE Receivables LLC, a wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary of the Company, and certain other Company subsidiaries' ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; or engage in other businesses.

Such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the Senior Notes in order to take certain actions. Disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents. Our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, a default under the Amended Credit Agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend. If we were unable to repay or refinance such indebtedness, the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement. If the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. In such event, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

Celanese and Celanese US are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy

their obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of Celanese US's obligations

under the Senior Notes and the Amended Credit Agreement by Celanese.

As holding companies, Celanese and Celanese US conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries, which own substantially all of our consolidated assets. Consequently, the principal source of cash to pay Celanese and Celanese US's obligations, including obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of Celanese US's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Indentures by Celanese, is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations. We cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable Celanese US and/or Celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable country or state laws, regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to Celanese US and Celanese. While the Amended Credit Agreement and the Indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits. In the event Celanese US and/or Celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, Celanese US and/or Celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Indentures, the guarantee of Celanese US's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Indentures by Celanese, or our other indebtedness.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "our" and "us," refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term "Celanese US" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP").

Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and other parts of this Annual Report involve both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below.

Forward-Looking Statements

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") and other parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Generally, words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "may," "can," "could," "might," "will" and similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. See "

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"

at the beginning of this Annual Report for further discussion.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

of this Annual Report also contains a description of certain risk factors that you should consider which could significantly affect our financial results. In addition, the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things:

•

changes in general economic, business, political and regulatory conditions in the countries or regions in which we operate;

•

the length and depth of product and industry business cycles particularly in the automotive, electrical, textiles, electronics and construction industries;

•

Consolidated Results

Year Ended December 31, 2015

Compared to

Year Ended December 31, 2014

Net sales

decreased

$1.1 billion

, or

16.6%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2015

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

unfavorable currency impacts across all our business segments resulting from a strong US dollar relative to the Euro;

•

lower pricing and volume in our Acetyl Intermediates segment for vinyl acetate monomer ("VAM") and acetic acid; and

•

lower acetate tow volume and pricing in our Consumer Specialties segment driven by customer destocking and reduced industry utilization, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

decreased

$252 million

, or

33.2%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2015

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

a decrease in pension and other postretirement plan net periodic benefit cost of

$164 million

;

•

cost savings of $50 million related to productivity initiatives across all of our business segments; and



•

lower functional spending and incentive compensation costs of $41 million.

Operating profit

decreased

$432 million

, or

57.0%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2015

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

a decrease in Net sales; and

•

an unfavorable impact from Other (charges) gains, net. In December 2015, we terminated our existing agreement with a raw materials supplier in Singapore. In connection with the contract termination, we recorded

$174 million

to Other (charges) gains, net. We also recorded long-lived impairment losses of

$123 million

to fully write-off certain ethanol related assets at our acetyl facility in Nanjing, China during the three months ended

December 31, 2015

. See

Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;

partially offset by:

•

a decrease in SG&A and lower raw material costs across all of our business segments.

Operating margin for the year ended

December 31, 2015

decreased to

5.7 %

from

11.1 %

in


.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased

$65 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

a

$48 million

gain resulting from restructuring the debt of a subsidiary of InfraServ GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG during the three months ended June 30, 2014, which did not recur in the current year. Our equity investment in InfraServ GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG is primarily owned by an entity included in our Other Activities segment, while our Consumer Specialties and Acetyl Intermediates segments also each hold an ownership percentage; and

•

a decrease in equity investment earnings of

$27 million

from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate as a result of lower pricing for methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("MTBE") and methanol.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2015

was

41%

compared to

33%

for the year ended


. The higher effective income tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2015

was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance due to an increase in losses in jurisdictions with no tax benefit. The increase in losses primarily relates to a

$123 million

long-lived asset impairment recorded to fully write-off certain ethanol related assets at our acetyl facility in Nanjing, China and a

$174 million

charge related to the termination of a raw materials contract with a supplier in Singapore. See

Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. The tax impact of these events was partially offset by decreases in uncertain tax positions of

$29 million

due to audit closures and technical jurisdictional clarifications.

Our effective income tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts and mix of income and loss in those jurisdictions to which they relate, as well as discrete items and non-deductible expenses that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year.

In 2015, we established a centralized European headquarters in the Netherlands for the purpose of improving the operational efficiencies and profitability of our European operations and certain global product lines and to centralize leadership and management functions in a single location. A key objective of our European headquarters is to align our business operations, identify cost savings and further streamline our operations. These activities directly impacted our mix of earnings and product flows and resulted in both favorable and unfavorable tax rate impacts in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These impacts have been reflected in Other foreign tax rate differentials included in the reconciliation of the significant differences between the US federal and statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate. See

Note 19 - Income Taxes

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Assuming no material changes to tax rules and regulations or cash repatriation plans, we expect to realize operational savings in connection with the establishment of our centralized European headquarters, which will directly impact the mix of our earnings and may result in favorable income tax impacts in subsequent years. Our effective tax rate will vary based on the jurisdictions in which income is actually generated and remains subject to potential volatility from changing tax legislation in the US and other tax jurisdictions. We continue to assess our business model and its impact in various jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, as of

December 31, 2015

we have

$550 million

available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility to assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations. During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, we had net borrowings of

$350 million

under our revolving credit facility primarily to fund

$420 million

in repurchases of our Series A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock").

While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, in


. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels.

Total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million in 2016 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our Industrial Specialties segment.

On a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, Celanese US, have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese US in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on Common Stock.

Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents as of

December 31, 2015

were

$967 million

,

an increase

of

$187 million

from

December 31, 2014

.

As of December 31, 2015

,

$923 million

of the

$967 million

of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the US, we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs. Currently, there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental US taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings. As a result, we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations.

•

an increase in net repayments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt of $196 million primarily as a result of redeeming our $600 million 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018;

•

an increase in stock repurchase transactions of $86 million; and

Debt and Other Obligations

Senior Notes

We have outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as follows (collectively, the "Senior Notes"):

The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Celanese US and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness of Celanese US. The Senior Notes were issued under indentures (collectively, the "Indentures") among Celanese US, Celanese and each of the domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US that guarantee its obligations under its senior secured credit facilities ("Subsidiary Guarantors") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Indentures contain covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; engage in transactions with affiliates; or engage in other businesses. Celanese US may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

In

October 2014

, Celanese US redeemed its

$600 million

6.625%

senior unsecured notes due


("

6.625%

Notes") at a redemption price of

103.313%

of the face amount for a total principal and premium payment of

$620 million

plus accrued interest of

$20 million

. Proceeds from the issuance of the

3.250%

Notes were used to partially fund the redemption of the

6.625%

Notes, as well as cash on hand. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of the

6.625%

Notes of

$24 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, which included the redemption premium of

$20 million

and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of

$4 million

Senior Credit Facilities

In September 2014, Celanese US, Celanese and certain of the domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US entered into an amendment agreement with the lenders under Celanese US's existing senior secured credit facilities in order to amend and restate the amended credit agreement dated September 16, 2013 (as amended and restated by the 2014 amendment agreement, the "Amended Credit Agreement"). Under the Amended Credit Agreement, all of the US dollar denominated Term C-2 term loans and all but

€28 million

of the Euro-denominated Term C-2 term loans under the 2013 amended credit agreement were converted into, or refinanced by, the Term C-3 loan facility with an extended maturity date of October 2018. The non-extended portions of the Term C-2 loan facility continue to have a maturity date of October 2016. In addition, the maturity date of our revolving credit facility was extended to October 2018 and the facility was increased to

$900 million

. Accordingly, the Amended Credit Agreement consists of the Term C-2 loan facility, the Term C-3 loan facility and a

$900 million

revolving credit facility. We borrowed

$550 million

and repaid

$200 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2015

. Borrowings were primarily used to fund repurchases of our Common Stock.

As of December 31, 2015

, the margin for borrowings under the Term C-2 loan facility was

2.0%

above the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") and the margin for borrowings under the Term C-3 loan facility was

2.25%

above London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") (for US dollars) and

2.25%

above EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable.

As of December 31, 2015

, the margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility was

1.5%

above LIBOR. The margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances based on changes in the corporate credit ratings of Celanese or Celanese US.

Term loan borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to amortization at

1%

of the initial principal amount per annum, payable quarterly. In addition, we pay quarterly commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility of

0.25%

per annum.

The Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese and certain domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US and is secured by a lien on substantially all assets of Celanese US and such guarantors, subject to certain agreed exceptions (including for certain real property and certain shares of foreign subsidiaries), pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated April 2, 2007.

As a condition to borrowing funds or requesting letters of credit be issued under the revolving credit facility, our first lien senior secured leverage ratio (as calculated as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered under the revolving facility) cannot exceed the threshold as specified below. Further, our first lien senior secured leverage ratio must be maintained at or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit facility.

Our first lien senior secured leverage ratios under the revolving credit facility are as follows:

The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions or hedge transactions; or engage in other businesses; as well as a covenant requiring maintenance of a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio.

The Amended Credit Agreement also maintains a number of events of default, including a cross default to other debt of Celanese, Celanese US, or their subsidiaries, including the Senior Notes, in an aggregate amount equal to more than

$50 million

and the occurrence of a change of control. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement.

We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of

December 31, 2015

.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility

As of

December 31, 2015

, the maximum borrowing base under our US accounts receivable securitization facility was

$120 million

. The US accounts receivable securitization facility purchase agreement expires in 2016, but may be extended for successive one year terms by agreement of the parties. All of the transferred assets have been pledged to the administrator of the US accounts receivable securitization facility in support of its obligations under the purchase agreement. During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, we increased borrowings outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility by

$20 million

. As of

December 31, 2015

, the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred under our US accounts receivable securitization facility was

$131 million

.

Share Capital

Our Board of Directors follows a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share of our Common Stock unless the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. The amount available to pay cash dividends is restricted by our Amended Credit Agreement and the Indentures.

On

February 4, 2016

, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.30

per share on our Common Stock amounting to

$44 million

. The cash dividend is for the period from

November 1, 2015

to

January 31, 2016

and will be paid on

February 26, 2016

to holders of record as of

February 16, 2016

. Cash dividends to be paid in


are expected to be slightly higher than the cash dividends paid in


based on the number of outstanding shares as of

December 31, 2015

and a quarterly cash dividend rate of

$0.30

.

Our Board of Directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of

$2.4 billion

of our Common Stock since February 2008. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, we spent

$420 million

on repurchased shares of our Common Stock. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had

$1.0 billion

remaining under authorizations by our Board of Directors.

Contractual Debt and Cash Obligations

The following table sets forth our fixed contractual debt and cash obligations as of

December 31, 2015

.

______________________________

(1)

Future interest expense is calculated using the rate in effect on

December 31, 2015

(2)

Other debt is primarily made up of fixed rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, short-term borrowings from affiliated companies, our revolving credit facility, our accounts receivable securitization facility and other bank obligations.

(3)

Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities, we are unable to determine the timing of payments related to our uncertain tax obligations, including interest and penalties. These amounts are therefore reflected in "After 5 Years".

(4)

Unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent the take-or-pay provisions included in certain long-term purchase agreements. We do not expect to incur material losses under these arrangements. These amounts also include other purchase obligations such as maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts, software agreements and other miscellaneous agreements and contracts, obtained via a survey of Celanese.

(5)

Excludes expected payments from nonqualified trusts related to nonqualified pension plans of $196 million.

Contractual Guarantees and Commitments

As of

December 31, 2015

, we have standby letters of credit of

$59 million

and bank guarantees of $6 million outstanding, which are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.

We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results. See

Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker. Our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include our engineered materials, cellulose derivatives, food ingredients, emulsion polymers, EVA polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.



When assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. After assessing qualitative factors, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative assessment is not required. If an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset, a quantitative analysis will be performed. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances.

In performing a quantitative analysis, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. We may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process. The valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches (market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis) and the discounted cash flow approach. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"). The WACC considers market and industry data as well as company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount, impairment of the reporting unit may exist. If the recoverability test indicates potential impairment, we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded to write down the carrying amount. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain long-lived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing.

Management tests other indefinite-lived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.

See

Note 11 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Recoverability of Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets

We assess the recoverability of long-lived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples of a change in events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decrease in the market price of the asset, a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used. To assess the recoverability of long-lived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Long-lived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.



The development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset. Projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. These projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally. When impairment is indicated, a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level, incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset, is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment. We believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value.

See

Note 10 - Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

and

Note 11 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible, amortizable intangible and long-lived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods. We periodically engage third-party valuation consultants to assist us with this process. Specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and company-specific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant. The current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions. To the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may occur in future periods.

•

Income Taxes

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed. In forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards, we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified. We attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature. Weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles. Less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature, and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide. Valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the

US, Luxembourg, Spain, China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Canada and France

. We have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.

The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment. If actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or Other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. In addition, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties.

See

Note 19 - Income Taxes

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

•

Benefit Obligations

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the discount rate, compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs. In addition, actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods.

Pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Assumptions are reviewed on a plan and country-specific basis by third-party actuaries and senior management. Such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook.

See

Note 15 - Benefit Obligations

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.



The estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in


from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows:

Accounting for Commitments and Contingencies

We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business, as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including: notifications, prior settlements, demands, which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel, available facts, identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior experience. A determination of the amount of loss contingency required, if any, is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available. Due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings.

Interest Rate Swaps

As of

December 31, 2015

, we had $1.1 billion, €176 million and CNY234 million of variable rate debt and US dollar interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of

$500 million

that expired January 2, 2016. These interest rate swap agreements had the economic effect of modifying the US dollar variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations.

•

Foreign Currency Forwards and Swaps

A portion of our assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the US dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results. For example, a decline in the value of the Euro versus the US dollar results in a decline in the US dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in Euros due to translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the Euro versus the US dollar would result in an opposite effect. We estimate that a one cent Euro/US dollar change in the exchange rate would impact our earnings by $5 million annually.

Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, as of

December 31, 2015

, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the three months ended

December 31, 2015

, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2015

. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Their report follows.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries' (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

December 31, 2015

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2015

, and our report dated

February 5, 2016

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

CELANESE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Description of the Company and Basis of Presentation

Description of the Company

Celanese Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") is a global technology and specialty materials company. The Company's business involves processing chemical raw materials, such as methanol, carbon monoxide and ethylene, and natural products, including wood pulp, into value-added chemicals, thermoplastic polymers and other chemical-based products.

Definitions

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The term "Celanese US" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") for all periods presented and include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified, have been presented to separately show the effects of discontinued operations.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements relative to a number of topics, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, supply agreements, product sales and other arrangements. The Company endeavors to describe those contracts or agreements that are material to its business, results of operations or financial position. The Company may also describe some arrangements that are not material but in which the Company believes investors may have an interest or which may have been included in a Form 8-K filing. Investors should not assume the Company has described all contracts and agreements relative to the Company's business in this Annual Report.

For those consolidated ventures in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than

100%

of the economics, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interests.

The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation.

2. Summary of Accounting Policies

Consolidation Principles

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for all periods presented and include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations, environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Market participant assumptions are categorized by a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. Valuations for fund investments, such as common/collective trusts, registered investment companies and short-term investment funds, which do not have readily determinable fair values, are typically estimated using a net asset value provided by a third party as a practical expedient.

The levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company

Level 2 - inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1

Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation

Purchase Accounting

The Company allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values are recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are valued using the relief from royalty and discounted cash flow methodologies, which are considered Level 3 measurements. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company's theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates, all of which require significant management judgment and, therefore, are susceptible to change. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. The Company calculates the fair value of the intangible assets acquired to allocate the purchase price at the acquisition date. The Company may use the assistance of third-party valuation consultants.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write-offs having a material impact on financial results is low. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated using factors such as customer credit ratings, past collection history and general risk profile. Receivables are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.

Inventories

Inventories, including stores and supplies, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Cost includes raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost for stores and supplies is primarily determined by the average cost method.

Investments

•

Marketable Securities

The cost of available-for-sale securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.



•

Investments in Affiliates

Investments where the Company can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of an investee, which is generally considered when an investor owns 20% or more of the voting stock of an investee, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments where the Company does not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company determined it cannot exercise significant influence over certain investments where the Company owns greater than a 20% interest due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on the Company's involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Accordingly, these investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.

In certain instances, the financial information of the Company's equity investees is not available on a timely basis. Accordingly, the Company records its proportional share of the investee's earnings or losses on a consistent lag of no more than

one quarter

.

When required to assess the recoverability of its investments in affiliates, the Company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The Company may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings, machinery and equipment, including capitalized interest, and property under capital lease agreements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company records depreciation and amortization in its consolidated statements of operations as either Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses consistent with the utilization of the underlying assets. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of depreciable assets:

Leasehold improvements are amortized over

10 years

or the remaining life of the respective lease, whichever is shorter.

Accelerated depreciation is recorded when the estimated useful life is shortened. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs, including costs for planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not extend the useful life of the asset are charged to earnings as incurred. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and depreciation accounts until sold or otherwise disposed. In the case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in earnings.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be assessed when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. The Company calculates the fair value using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for the asset group, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections involve significant judgment and are based on management's estimate of current and forecasted market conditions and cost structure. Impairment losses are generally recorded to Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets either qualitatively or quantitatively annually during the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. Impairment losses are generally recorded to Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations.



•

Goodwill

Recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. In performing a quantitative analysis, the Company measures the recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. The Company may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process.

•

Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company's theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants.

•

Definite-lived Intangible Assets

Customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from

four

to

20 years

.

Derivative and Hedging Instruments

The Company manages its exposures to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The fair value of all derivative instruments is recorded as an asset or liability on a net basis at the balance sheet date.

•

Interest Rate Risk Management

To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the Company's variable rate debt, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation. These interest rate swap agreements fix the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") portion of the Company's US dollar denominated variable rate borrowings. Prior to December 2014, all or a portion of these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, to the extent the cash flow hedge was effective, changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps were included in gain (loss) from cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the interest rate swap is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the interest rate swap expires or the cash flow hedge is dedesignated because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur according to the original strategy. In December 2014, the Company dedesignated as cash flow hedges a notional value of

$500 million

US dollar interest rate swap agreements expiring

January 2, 2016

. When a cash flow hedge is dedesignated and it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net would be reclassified to earnings immediately. Mark-to-market adjustments on dedesignated interest rate swap agreements are included in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations through their expiration.

•

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

Certain subsidiaries of the Company have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies, which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company also is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on transactions with third-party entities as well as intercompany transactions. The Company minimizes its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forwards and swaps. These foreign currency forwards and swaps are not designated as hedges. Gains and losses on foreign currency forwards and swaps entered into to offset foreign exchange impacts on intercompany balances are included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and



losses on foreign currency forwards and swaps entered into to offset foreign exchange impacts on all other assets and liabilities are included in Foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company uses non-derivative financial instruments that may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains or losses to hedge the foreign currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses from remeasurement of the non-derivative financial instrument is included in foreign currency translation within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged investment is sold or liquidated.

Prior to March 2015, the Company used cross-currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of the contracts, the Company would have exchanged Euro fixed interest for US dollar fixed interest and at maturity would have exchanged Euro notional values for US dollar notional values. The terms of the contracts corresponded to the related hedged intercompany loans. The cross-currency swap contracts were designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on the contracts was included in gain (loss) from cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses were reclassified to Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the period that the hedged loans affected earnings. The Euro notional values were marked-to-market based on the current spot rate and gains and losses from remeasurement of the Euro notional values, as well as the foreign exchange impact on the intercompany loans, were included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. In March 2015, the Company settled its cross-currency swap agreements.

•

Commodity Risk Management

The Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its procurement of certain raw materials. The Company manages its exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts. The Company regularly assesses its practice of using forward purchase contracts and other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with changes in economic conditions. Forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through physical delivery of the commodity. For qualifying contracts, the Company has elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception based on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that the Company would not net settle and the transaction would result in the physical delivery of the commodity. Accordingly, realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

Insurance Loss Reserves

The Company has

two

wholly-owned insurance companies (the "Captives") that are used as a form of self-insurance for liability and workers compensation risks. Capitalization of the Captives is determined by regulatory guidelines. Premiums written are recognized as revenue based on policy periods. One of the Captives also insures certain third-party risks. The Captives use reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risks, however these arrangements do not relieve the Captives from their obligations to policyholders. The financial condition of the Captives' reinsurers are monitored to minimize exposure to insolvencies. However, failure of the reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Captives.

Claim reserves are established when sufficient information is available to indicate a specific policy is involved and the Company can reasonably estimate its liability. These reserves are based on management estimates and periodic actuarial valuations. In addition, reserves have been established to cover exposures for both known and unreported claims. Estimates of these liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly, however it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Periodically, the Company will conclude a site no longer has an indeterminate life based on long-lived asset impairment triggering events and decisions made by the Company. Accordingly, the Company will record asset retirement obligations associated with such sites. To measure the fair value of the asset retirement obligations, the Company will use the expected present value technique, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The expected present value technique uses a set of cash flows that represent the probability-weighted average of all possible cash flows based on the Company's judgment. The Company uses the following inputs to determine the fair value of the asset retirement obligations based on the Company's experience with fulfilling obligations of this type and the Company's knowledge of market conditions: (a) labor costs; (b) allocation of overhead costs; (c) profit on labor and overhead costs; (d) effect of inflation on estimated costs and profits; (e) risk premium for bearing the uncertainty inherent in cash flows, other than inflation; (f) time value of money represented by the risk-free interest rate commensurate with the timing of the associated cash flows; and (g) nonperformance risk relating to



the liability, which includes the Company's own credit risk. The asset retirement obligations are accreted to their undiscounted values until the time at which they are expected to be settled.

The Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to certain of its existing operating facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities indefinitely and therefore, a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites, an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time. If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows.

Environmental Liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company's operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the site, the Company accrues through

15 years

, unless the Company has government orders or other agreements that extend beyond

15 years

. The Company estimates environmental liabilities on a case-by-case basis using the most current status of available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation monitoring costs. These undiscounted reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance. The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on the Company's periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort. The Company utilizes third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for its sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized using a method that approximates the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt into Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon the extinguishment of the related debt, any unamortized deferred financing costs are immediately expensed and included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon the modification of the related debt, a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs may be immediately expensed and included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Direct costs of refinancing activities are immediately expensed and included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Pension and Other Postretirement Obligations

The Company recognizes a balance sheet asset or liability for each of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan's funded status as of a December 31 measurement date. The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the discount rate, compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs. In addition, actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation.

The Company applies the long-term expected rate of return to the fair value of plan assets and immediately recognizes in operating results the change in fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Events requiring a plan remeasurement will be recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement plan net periodic benefit costs are recorded on a quarterly basis.

The Company allocates the service cost and amortization of prior service cost (or credit) components of its pension and postretirement plans to its business segments. Interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses are considered financing activities managed at the corporate level and are recorded to Other Activities. The Company believes the expense allocation appropriately matches the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment.



Other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. The key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") are the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate.

•

Discount Rate

As of the measurement date, the Company determines the appropriate discount rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed-income securities.

In the US, the rate used to discount pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities is based on a yield curve developed from market data of over


Aa-grade non-callable bonds at the measurement date. This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

The Company determines its discount rates in the Euro zone using the iBoxx Euro Corporate AA Bond indices with appropriate adjustments for the duration of the plan obligations. In other international locations, the Company determines its discount rates based on the yields of high quality government bonds with a duration appropriate to the duration of the plan obligations.

•

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets

The Company determines the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation, as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested. A single long-term expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the long-term expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan.

The expected rate of return is assessed annually and is based on long-term relationships among major asset classes and the level of incremental returns that can be earned by the successful implementation of different active investment management strategies. Equity returns are based on estimates of long-term inflation rate, real rate of return,

10-year

Treasury bond premium over cash and historical equity risk premium. Fixed income returns are based on maturity, historical long-term inflation, real rate of return and credit spreads.

•

Investment Policies and Strategies

The investment objectives for the Company's pension plans are to earn, over a moving twenty-year period, a long-term expected rate of return, net of investment fees and transaction costs, sufficient to satisfy the benefit obligations of the plan, while at the same time maintaining adequate liquidity to pay benefit obligations and proper expenses, and meet any other cash needs, in the short- to medium-term.

The equity and debt securities objectives are to provide diversified exposure across the US and global equity markets and to manage the risks and returns of the plans through the use of multiple managers and strategies. The fixed income strategy is designed to reduce liability-related interest rate risk by investing in bonds that match the duration and credit quality of the plan liabilities. Derivatives-based strategies may be used to mitigate investment risks.

The financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each plan's liability structure. The Company's asset allocation policy is based on detailed asset/liability analysis. In developing investment policy and financial goals, consideration is given to each plan's demographics, the returns and risks associated with current and alternative investment strategies and the current and projected cash, expense and funding ratios of each plan. Investment policies must also comply with local statutory requirements as determined by each country. A formal asset/liability study of each plan is undertaken every three to five years or whenever there has been a material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or funding status and investment market. The Company has adopted a long-term investment horizon such that the risk and duration of investment losses are weighed against the long-term potential for appreciation of assets. Although there cannot be complete assurance that these objectives will be realized, it is believed that the likelihood for their realization is reasonably high, based upon the asset allocation chosen and the historical and expected performance of the asset classes utilized by the plans. The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified across asset classes, investment styles, market sectors, investment managers, developed and emerging markets and securities in order to moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments may be in separate accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and other pooled asset portfolios provided they all conform to fiduciary standards.



External investment managers are hired to manage pension assets. Investment consultants assist with the screening process for each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the investment portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a composite of market indices that are weighted to match each plan's target asset allocation. The portfolio return should also (over the long-term) meet or exceed the return used for actuarial calculations in order to meet the future needs of each plan.

Commitments and Contingencies

Due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, the Company's litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss ("Possible Loss") may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from legal proceedings. For reasonably possible loss contingencies that may be material, the Company estimates its Possible Loss when determinable, considering that the Company could incur no loss in certain matters.

For some matters, the Company is unable, at this time, to estimate its Possible Loss that is reasonably possible of occurring. Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the more difficult it is for the Company to estimate the Possible Loss that is reasonably possible the Company could incur. The Company may disclose certain information related to a plaintiff's claim against the Company alleged in the plaintiff's pleadings or otherwise publicly available. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent the Company's estimate of reasonably possible or probable loss. Some of the Company's exposure in legal matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. The Company does not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals or any estimates of Possible Loss. Thus, the Company's exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly materially so, than the Company's litigation accruals and estimates of Possible Loss.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products, and provided that four basic criteria are met: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (b) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (c) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (d) collectibility is reasonably assured. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers in a sales transaction are recorded in Net sales and shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded in Cost of sales.

Research and Development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Management Compensation Plans

Share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized over the participant's requisite service period. Upon termination of a participant's employment with the Company by reason of death or disability, retirement or by the Company without cause (as defined in the respective award agreements), a prorated award will generally vest on the original vesting date. The prorated award is calculated based on the time lapsed between the grant date and the date of termination, reduced by awards previously vested. Upon the termination of a Participant's employment with the Company for any other reason, any unvested portion of the award shall be forfeited and canceled without consideration.

•

Stock Options

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low price of the Company's Series A common stock, par value

$0.0001

per share ("Common Stock") on the grant date. Options issued under the 2009 Global Incentive Plan ("2009 GIP") have a term of

seven

years and vest on a graded basis over either

three

or

four years

. The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on the Company's historical volatilities. When establishing the expected life assumptions, the Company reviews annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods. The estimated fair value of the Company's stock option awards less expected forfeitures is recognized over the vesting period of the respective grant on a straight-line basis.

Generally, vested stock options are exercised through a broker-assisted cashless exercise program. A broker-assisted cashless exercise is the simultaneous exercise of a stock option by an employee and a sale of the shares through a broker. Authorized shares of the Company's Common Stock are used to settle stock options.



•

Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

Performance-based RSUs.

The Company generally grants performance-based RSUs to the Company's executive officers and certain employees annually in February. The Company may also grant performance-based RSUs to certain new employees or to employees who assume positions of increasing responsibility at the time those events occur. The fair value of the Company's performance-based RSUs with a performance condition is equal to the average of the high and low price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Performance-based RSUs generally vest in two equal tranches with the final tranche vesting

three years

from the grant date. Compensation expense for performance-based RSUs less estimated forfeitures is recognized over the vesting period of the respective grant based on the accelerated attribution method.

The number of performance-based RSUs that ultimately vest is dependent on the achievement of internal profitability targets (performance condition). Based on the achievement of internal profitability targets, the ultimate number of shares of the Company's Common Stock issued will range from

zero to stretch

, with stretch defined individually under each award, net of shares used to cover minimum statutory personal income taxes withheld. Performance-based RSUs are canceled to the extent actual results do not meet minimum internal profitability measures, as defined individually under each award.

Time-based RSUs.

The Company grants non-employee Directors time-based RSUs annually that generally vest

one year

from the grant date. The Company also grants time-based RSUs to the Company's executives and certain employees that vest ratably over

three years

. The fair value of the time-based RSUs is equal to the average of the high and low price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Compensation expense for time-based RSUs less estimated forfeitures is recognized over the vesting period of the respective grant on a straight-line basis.

The Company's RSUs are net settled by withholding shares of the Company's Common Stock to cover minimum statutory income taxes and remitting the remaining shares of the Company's Common Stock to an individual brokerage account. Authorized shares of the Company's Common Stock are used to settle RSUs.

Under the 2009 GIP, the Company may not grant RSUs with the right to participate in dividends or dividend equivalents.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date.

The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical merits, that the positions will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax (provision) benefit in the consolidated statements of operations.

Functional and Reporting Currencies

For the Company's international operations where the functional currency is other than the US dollar, assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates, while the statement of operations amounts are translated using the average exchange rates for the respective period. Differences arising from the translation of assets and liabilities in comparison with the



translation of the previous periods or from initial recognition during the period are included as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-17,

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

("ASU 2015-17"). ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of adopting this ASU to be material to the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory

("ASU 2015-11"). ASU 2015-11 applies to inventory that is measured using the FIFO or average cost method and requires measurement of that inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of adopting this ASU to be material to the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,

Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)

("ASU 2015-07"). ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. This ASU also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, such disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. This ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-07 in accordance with the FASB's disclosure simplification initiatives.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

("ASU 2015-03"). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by ASU 2015-03. The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require retrospective application and represent a change in accounting principle. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 for the year ended December 31, 2015, and applied its provisions retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of

$22 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs from Other noncurrent assets to a reduction of Long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. Unamortized debt issuance costs of

$18 million

were recorded as a reduction to Long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Company's revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities are included in Other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASU 2014-09")

.

ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

and most industry-specific guidance throughout the ASC, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU provides alternative methods of adoption. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date

("ASU 2015-14"). ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after that date and permits early adoption of the standards, but not before original effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

4. Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures

Acquisitions

In October 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Cool Polymers, Inc., including CoolPoly

®

, a portfolio of thermally conductive polymers for cash plus contingent consideration

(

Note 25

), to support the



strategic growth of the Company's engineered materials business. The acquired operations are included in the Company's Advanced Engineered Materials segment.

Pro forma financial information since the respective acquisition date has not been provided as the acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's financial information. The Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill (

Note 2

and

Note 11

).

Plant Closures

•

Lanaken, Belgium

On April 22, 2015, the Company announced its intention to consult with employee representatives on a potential

50%

capacity reduction at its acetate tow facility in Lanaken, Belgium. On December 1, 2015, the Company announced it had completed the consultation process pursuant to which the Company ceased

50%

of manufacturing operations in December 2015. The Lanaken, Belgium operations are included in the Company's Consumer Specialties segment.

Tarragona, Spain

In March 2015, the Company launched a sale process for its conventional and vinyl acetate ethylene ("VAE") emulsions facilities in Tarragona, Spain. On December 4, 2015, the Company announced the sale of its conventional emulsions production facility. The Company was unable to find a credible buyer for the VAE emulsions facility, resulting in its closure. The Company completed the information and consultation process with employee representatives pursuant to which the Company ceased all manufacturing operations at the VAE emulsions facility. The Tarragona, Spain operations are included in the Company's Industrial Specialties segment.

The exit costs and plant shutdown costs related to the closure of the Tarragona VAE facility and the sale of the conventional facility (

Note 18

) are as follows:

(1)

Included in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations.



•

Meredosia, Illinois

On December 15, 2015, the Company ceased operation of its VAE emulsions facility in Meredosia, Illinois. The Meredosia, Illinois operations are included in the Company's Industrial Specialties segment.

The exit costs and plant shutdown costs related to the closure of the Meredosia, Illinois VAE facility (

Note 18

) are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Included in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

During the

year ended

December 31, 2015

, the Company also recorded

$39 million

in accelerated depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment no longer in use at the Company's ethanol technology development unit in Clear Lake, Texas. The accelerated depreciation is included in Research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and is included in the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment.

Plant Relocation

In November 2006, the Company finalized a settlement agreement with the Frankfurt, Germany Airport ("Fraport") that required the Company to cease operations at its Kelsterbach, Germany POM site and sell the site, including land and buildings, to Fraport, resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned Fraport expansion. Upon completion of certain activities as specified in the settlement agreement, title to the land and buildings transferred to Fraport during the three months ended December 31, 2013, and deferred proceeds of

€651 million

were recognized in Gain (loss) on disposition of businesses and assets, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The activity was included in the Company's Advanced Engineered Materials segment.

5. Ventures and Variable Interest Entities

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

In February 2014, the Company formed a joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC ("Fairway"), with Mitsui & Co., Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan ("Mitsui"), in which the Company owns a

50%

interest, for the production of methanol at the Company's integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. The methanol unit utilizes natural gas in the US Gulf Coast region as a feedstock and benefits from the existing infrastructure at the Company's Clear Lake facility. Both Mitsui and the Company supply their own natural gas to Fairway in exchange for methanol tolling under a cost-plus off-take arrangement. The methanol facility has an annual capacity of

1.3 million

tons. Fairway began production in October 2015.

The Company determined that Fairway is a variable interest entity ("VIE") in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Under the terms of the joint venture agreements, the Company provides site services and day-to-day operations for the methanol facility. In addition, the joint venture agreements provide that the Company indemnifies Mitsui for environmental obligations that exceed a specified threshold, as well as an equity option between the partners. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the venture and records a noncontrolling interest for the share of the venture owned by Mitsui. Fairway is included in the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment.



The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities associated with Fairway included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Assets can only be used to settle the obligations of Fairway.

(2)

Amounts owed by Fairway to the Company for reimbursement of expenditures.

Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company holds variable interests in entities that supply certain raw materials and services to the Company. The variable interests primarily relate to cost-plus contractual arrangements with the suppliers and recovery of capital expenditures for certain plant assets plus a rate of return on such assets. Liabilities for such supplier recoveries of capital expenditures have been recorded as capital lease obligations. The entities are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entities as it does not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these VIEs as of

December 31, 2015

relates primarily to the recovery of capital expenditures for certain property, plant and equipment.

The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities associated with the obligations to nonconsolidated VIEs, as well as the maximum exposure to loss relating to these nonconsolidated VIEs are as follows:

The difference between the total liabilities associated with obligations to unconsolidated VIEs and the maximum exposure to loss primarily represents take-or-pay obligations for services included in the Company's unconditional purchase obligations (

Note 24

).



6. Marketable Securities, at Fair Value

The Company's nonqualified trusts hold available-for-sale securities for funding requirements of the Company's nonqualified pension plans (

Note 15

) as follows:

7. Receivables, Net

8. Inventories

9. Investments in Affiliates

Entities in which the Company has an investment accounted for under the cost or equity method of accounting are considered affiliates; any transactions or balances with such companies are considered affiliate transactions.



Equity Method

Equity method investments and ownership interests by business segment are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

InfraServ real estate service companies ("InfraServ Entities") own and operate sites in Frankfurt am Main-Hoechst, Gendorf and Knapsack, Germany. The InfraServ Entities were created to own land and property and to provide various technical and administrative services at these manufacturing locations.

(2)

InfraServ GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG is owned primarily by an entity included in the Company's Other Activities. The Company's Consumer Specialties segment and Acetyl Intermediates segment also each hold an ownership percentage. During the

three months ended

June 30, 2014, InfraServ GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG restructured the debt of a subsidiary resulting in additional equity in net earnings of affiliates of

$48 million

.

(3)

The Company accounts for its ownership interest in Sherbrooke Capital Health and Wellness, L.P. under the equity method of accounting because the Company is able to exercise significant influence.

Cost Method

Cost method investments and ownership interests by business segment are as follows:



Transactions with Affiliates

The Company owns manufacturing facilities at the InfraServ location in Frankfurt am Main-Hoechst, Germany and has contractual agreements with the InfraServ Entities and certain other equity affiliates and investees accounted for under the cost method. These contractual agreements primarily relate to energy purchases, site services and purchases of product for consumption and resale.

Transactions and balances with affiliates are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

11. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

Goodwill

______________________________

(1)

There were

$0 million

of accumulated impairment losses as of

December 31, 2015

.

In connection with the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company did not record an impairment loss to goodwill during the three months ended September 30,


as the estimated fair value for each of the Company's reporting units exceeded the carrying amount of the underlying assets by a substantial margin (

Note 2

). No events or changes in circumstances occurred during the three months ended

December 31, 2015

Related to the Company's outstanding senior credit facilities - Term C-2 and Term C-3 loans, senior unsecured notes issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (collectively, the "Senior Notes") and pollution control bonds.

Senior Notes

The Company has outstanding Senior Notes, as follows:



The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Celanese US and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness of Celanese US. The Senior Notes were issued under indentures (collectively, the "Indentures") among Celanese US, Celanese and each of the domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US that guarantee its obligations under its senior secured credit facilities ("Subsidiary Guarantors") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Indentures contain covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company's ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; engage in transactions with affiliates; or engage in other businesses. Celanese US may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

In

October 2014

, Celanese US redeemed its

$600 million

of principal amount of

6.625%

unsecured senior notes due 2018 ("6.625% Notes") at a redemption price of

103.313%

of the face amount for a total principal and premium payment of

$620 million

plus accrued interest of

$20 million

. Proceeds from the issuance of the 3.250% Notes were used to partially fund the redemption of the 6.625% Notes, as well as cash on hand. The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the 6.625% Notes comprised of the redemption premium of

$20 million

and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of

$4 million

, which were included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Senior Credit Facilities

In September 2014, Celanese US, Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into an amendment agreement with the lenders under Celanese US's existing senior secured credit facilities in order to amend and restate the amended credit agreement dated September 16, 2013 (as amended and restated by the 2014 amendment agreement, the "Amended Credit Agreement"). Under the Amended Credit Agreement, all of the US dollar denominated Term C-2 term loans and all but

€28 million

of the Euro-denominated Term C-2 term loans under the 2013 amended credit agreement were converted into, or refinanced by, the Term C-3 loan facility with an extended maturity date of October


. The non-extended portions of the Term C-2 loan facility continue to have a maturity date of October


. In addition, the maturity date of the Company's revolving credit facility was extended to October


and the facility was increased to

$900 million

. Accordingly, the Amended Credit Agreement consists of the Term C-2 loan facility, the Term C-3 loan facility and a

$900 million

revolving credit facility.



Net deferred financing costs are as follows:

____________________________

(1)

Relates to the September 2013 amendment to the Celanese US existing senior secured credit facilities to reduce the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings thereby creating the Term C-2 loan facility due


.

(2)

Includes

$6 million

related to the issuance of the

3.250%

Notes and

$4 million

related to the September 2014 amendment to the Celanese US existing senior secured credit facilities.

(3)

Includes

$4 million

related to the

6.625%

Notes redemption and

$1 million

related to the Term C-2 loan facility conversion.

(4)

Includes

$4 million

and

$5 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively, related to the Company's revolving credit facility and accounts receivables securitization facility, which are included in Other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2015

, the margin for borrowings under the Term C-2 loan facility was

2.0%

above the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") and the margin for borrowings under the Term C-3 loan facility was

2.25%

above LIBOR (for US dollars) and

2.25%

above EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable.

As of December 31, 2015

, the margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility was

1.5%

above LIBOR. The margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances based on changes in the corporate credit ratings of Celanese or Celanese US.

Term loan borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to amortization at

1%

of the initial principal amount per annum, payable quarterly. In addition, the Company pays quarterly commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility of

0.25%

per annum.

The Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese and certain domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US and is secured by a lien on substantially all assets of Celanese US and such guarantors, subject to certain agreed exceptions (including for certain real property and certain shares of foreign subsidiaries), pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated

April 2, 2007

.

As a condition to borrowing funds or requesting letters of credit be issued under the revolving credit facility, the Company's first lien senior secured leverage ratio (as calculated as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered under the revolving facility) cannot exceed the threshold as specified below. Further, the Company's first lien senior secured leverage ratio must be maintained at or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit facility.

The Company's amended first lien senior secured leverage ratios under the revolving credit facility are as follows:



The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company's ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions or hedge transactions; or engage in other businesses; as well as a covenant requiring maintenance of a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio.

The Amended Credit Agreement also maintains a number of events of default, including a cross default to other debt of Celanese, Celanese US, or their subsidiaries, including the Senior Notes, in an aggregate amount equal to more than

$50 million

and the occurrence of a change of control. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement.

The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants related to its debt agreements as of

December 31, 2015

.

Accounts Receivables Securitization Facility

In August 2013, the Company entered into a US accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to (i) a Purchase and Sale Agreement ("Sale Agreement") among certain US subsidiaries of the Company (each an "Originator"), Celanese International Corporation ("CIC") and CE Receivables LLC, a wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary of an Originator ("Transferor") and (ii) a Receivables Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement"), among CIC, as servicer, the Transferor, various third-party purchasers (collectively, "Purchasers") and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch, as administrator ("Administrator"). During 2015, the Sale Agreement and the Purchase Agreement were amended to reflect changes to the parties. The Purchase Agreement expires in


, but may be extended for successive one year terms by agreement of the parties. All of the Transferor's assets have been pledged to the Administrator in support of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement.

The Company's balances available for borrowing are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

The Company borrowed

$550 million

and repaid

$200 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2015

. Borrowings were primarily used to fund repurchases of the Company's Common Stock.

(2)

The Company borrowed

$35 million

and repaid

$15 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

(3)

Outstanding accounts receivable transferred by the Originators to the Transferor was

$131 million

. On November 5, 2015, the Company reduced the maximum borrowing base from

$135 million

to

$120 million

.



Principal payments scheduled to be made on the Company's debt, including short-term borrowings, are as follows:

15. Benefit Obligations

Pension Obligations

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North America, Europe and Asia. Independent trusts or insurance companies administer the majority of these plans. Pension obligations are established for benefits payable in the form of retirement, disability and surviving dependent pensions. The commitments result from participation in defined contribution and defined benefit plans, primarily in the US. Benefits are dependent on years of service and the employee's compensation. Supplemental retirement benefits provided to certain employees are nonqualified for US tax purposes. Separate nonqualified trusts have been established for certain US nonqualified plan obligations. Pension costs under the Company's retirement plans are actuarially determined.

In October 2014, the Company offered a limited-time, voluntary program to certain participants of the Company's US qualified defined benefit pension plan with a vested benefit who terminated from the Company on or before May 31, 2014. The limited-time opportunity ended in November 2014 and included an offer of a single lump sum payment in December 2014 or to begin monthly annuity payments, regardless of age, or to continue to defer benefits until retirement age. If an election was not made by the eligible participant, the participant will begin receiving payments when otherwise eligible under the terms of the US qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Company made lump sum payments under this program of

$143 million

in December 2014 using trust assets of the US qualified defined benefit pension plan. These actions resulted in the recognition of a settlement gain of

$78 million

in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Effective June 2014, the Company's US qualified defined benefit plan was amended and benefits offered to all current union participants of the Cash Balance Plan (hired on or after January 1, 2001) at the Company's Narrows, Virginia facility have been frozen and the US qualified defined benefit plan was closed to future union participants at the facility. Accumulated benefits earned and service rendered through May 2014 under the Plan provisions for the Cash Balance Plan Participants will continue to be considered for purposes of determining retirement benefits. Effective May 2014, the Company's US qualified defined benefit plan was amended and benefits offered to all current union participants of the Flat Rate Plan at the Company's Narrows, Virginia facility have been frozen and the US qualified defined benefit plan was closed to future union participants at the facility. Accumulated benefits earned and service rendered through December 2014 under the Plan provisions for the Flat Rate Plan Participants will continue to be considered for purposes of determining retirement benefits and eligibility for early retirement. These actions did not result in a curtailment gain or loss as the projected benefit obligation does not rely on salary assumptions.

During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the Company settled certain of its defined benefit pension plan obligations in the United Kingdom and Canada, which resulted in the recognition of settlement losses of

$9 million

in the consolidated statement of operations.

Effective December 2013, benefits offered to all US non-union eligible employees in the Company's US qualified defined benefit pension plan have been frozen and the US qualified defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants. Accumulated benefits earned and service rendered through December 31, 2013 under the US qualified defined benefit pension plan provisions will continue to be considered for purposes of determining retirement benefits and eligibility for early retirement. These actions resulted in the recognition of a curtailment gain of

$61 million

in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2013.

The Company participates in a multiemployer defined benefit plan and a multiemployer defined contribution plan in Germany covering certain employees. The Company's contributions to the multiemployer defined benefit plan are based on specified percentages of employee contributions as outlined in a works council agreement, covering all German entity employees hired



prior to January 1, 2012. As of January 1, 2012, the multiemployer defined benefit pension plan described above was closed to new employees. Qualifying employees hired in Germany after December 31, 2011 are covered by a multiemployer defined contribution plan. The Company's contributions to the multiemployer defined contribution plan are based on specified percentages of employee contributions, similar to the multiemployer defined benefit plan, but at a lower rate.

Statutory regulations and the works council agreement require the contributions to fully fund the multiemployer plans. The risks of participating in the multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:

•

Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.

•

If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, any underfunding may be borne by the remaining participants, especially since regulations strictly enforce funding requirements.

•

If the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, the Company may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as the withdrawal liability.

Based on the


unaudited and


audited multiemployer defined benefit plan's financial statements, the plan is 100% funded in


,


and


. The number of employees covered by the Company's multiemployer defined benefit plan remained relatively stable year over year from


to


, resulting in minimal changes to employer contributions. Participation in the German multiemployer defined benefit plan is not considered individually significant to the Company.

Contributions made by the Company to the German multiemployer plan are as follows:

Other Postretirement Obligations

Certain retired employees receive postretirement health care and life insurance benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which has the right to modify or terminate these plans at any time. The cost for coverage is shared between the Company and the retiree. The cost of providing retiree health care and life insurance benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee group. The Company's policy is to fund benefits as claims and premiums are paid. The US postretirement health care plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2006.

In November 2013, the Company announced it would amend its primary US postretirement health care plan to (a) eliminate eligibility for all current and future US non-union employees; (b) terminate its US postretirement health care plan on December 31, 2014 for all US participants; and (c) offer certain eligible US participants a lump-sum buyout payment if they irrevocably waive all future benefits under the US postretirement health care plan and end their participation before December 31, 2014. These actions generated a prior service credit of

$92 million

, which was amortized ratably into the consolidated statements of operations from November 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014.

Effective March 2014, the Company eliminated eligibility in its US postretirement health care plan for all current and future employees represented by the bargaining unit at the Company's Narrows, Virginia facility. These actions generated a prior service credit of

$5 million

, which was amortized ratably into the consolidated statements of operations from April 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.

The Company recognized

$84 million

and

$13 million

of prior service credit amortization and made

$40 million

and

$23 million

in lump-sum buyout payments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Postemployment Obligations

The Company provides benefits to certain employees after employment but prior to retirement, including severance and disability-related benefits offered pursuant to ongoing benefit arrangements. The cost of providing postemployment benefits is actuarially determined and recorded when the obligation is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated.



Postemployment obligations are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North America, Europe and Asia covering certain employees. Employees may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these contributions in varying amounts. The Company's matching contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on specified percentages of employee contributions.

Beginning in 2014, the Company took the following actions as it relates to the US defined contribution plan:

•

Increased its employer match for those employees participating in the US defined contribution plan;

•

Added an annual retirement contribution for US employees who are employed as of December 31st each year (or have died during that year), regardless of whether the employee contributes to the US defined contribution plan; and

•

For certain eligible US employees, provides an incremental retirement contribution through 2017, based on years of service and specified percentages of eligible compensation.

The amount of costs recognized for the Company's defined contribution plans are as follows:

Plan Assets

The weighted average target asset allocations for the Company's pension plans in


are as follows:

On average, the actual return on the US qualified defined pension plans' assets over the long-term (20 years) has exceeded the expected long-term rate of asset return assumption. The US qualified defined benefit plans' actual return on assets for the year ended

December 31, 2015

was

2.5%

loss versus an expected long-term rate of asset return assumption of

8.0%

. The expected long-term rate of asset return assumption used to determine 2016 net periodic benefit cost is

7.5%

for the US qualified defined benefit plans primarily due to an increase in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums.

The Company's defined benefit plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (

Note 2

) as follows:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Foreign and domestic currencies as well as short term securities are valued at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.

Equity securities, treasuries and corporate debt:

Valued at the closing price reported on the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Automated quotes are provided by multiple pricing services and validated by the plan custodian. These securities are traded on exchanges as well as in the over the counter market.

Registered Investment Companies:

Composed of various mutual funds and other investment companies whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic equities, fixed income securities, and short term investments. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end.

Common/Collective Trusts:

Composed of various funds whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic equities, fixed income securities, and short term investments. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end.



Derivatives:

Derivative financial instruments are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and swaps, and options are observable in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.

Mortgage backed securities:

Fair value is estimated based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing services for identical or comparable assets. Mortgage Backed Securities are traded in the over the counter broker/dealer market.

Insurance contracts:

Valued at contributions made, plus earnings, less participant withdrawals and administrative expenses, which approximates fair value.

Short-term investment funds:

Composed of various funds whose portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic currencies as well as short-term securities. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end.

Other:

Composed of real estate investment trust common stock valued at closing price as reported on the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

16. Environmental

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations worldwide that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company is also subject to retained environmental obligations specified in various contractual agreements arising from the divestiture of certain businesses by the Company or one of its predecessor companies.

The components of environmental remediation reserves are as follows:

Remediation

Due to its industrial history and through retained contractual and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on divested, demerger, orphan or US Superfund sites (as defined below). In addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the Company and Hoechst AG ("Hoechst"), a specified portion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Company (

Note 24

). The Company



provides for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company believes that environmental remediation costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given period.

The Company did not record any insurance recoveries during


or have any receivables for insurance recoveries related to these matters as of

December 31, 2015

. As of

December 31, 2015

and


, there were receivables of

$4 million

and

$4 million

, respectively, from the former owner of the Company's Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom acetate flake, tow and film business, which was acquired in 2007.

German InfraServ Entities

The Company's InfraServ Entities (

Note 9

) are liable for any residual contamination and other pollution because they own the real estate on which the individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, and its legal successors, as the responsible party under German public law, is liable to third parties for all environmental damage that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and real estate (

Note 24

). The contribution agreements entered into in 1997 between Hoechst and the respective operating companies, as part of the divestiture of these companies, provide that the operating companies will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against environmental liabilities resulting from the transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServ Entities have agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against any environmental liability arising out of or in connection with environmental pollution of any site.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the InfraServ partnership. Also, under lease agreements entered into by an InfraServ partner as landlord, the tenants agreed to pay certain remediation costs on a pro rata basis.

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination, the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are not satisfied by either the InfraServ Entities or their owners, these liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst, and its legal successors, will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any such costs. Likewise, in certain circumstances the Company could be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on several sites that were not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst, and its legal successors, must also reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The Company's ownership interest and environmental liability participation percentages for such liabilities, which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Gross reserves maintained by the respective InfraServ entity.

US Superfund Sites

In the US, the Company may be subject to substantial claims brought by US federal or state regulatory agencies or private individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In particular, the Company has a potential liability under the US Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws (collectively referred to as "Superfund") for investigation and cleanup costs at certain sites. At most of these sites, numerous companies, including the Company, or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the US Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), state governing bodies or private individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible parties ("PRP") under Superfund or related laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites, and the status of the insurance coverage for some of these proceedings is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot accurately determine its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs at these sites.



As events progress at each site for which it has been named a PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these liabilities, the Company considers its shipment of waste to a site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company joins with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that settle, among PRPs, each party's percentage allocation of costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most current information available.

One such site is the Lower Passaic River Study Area, which is the lower 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River ("Site"). The Company and


other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") at the Site in order to identify the levels of contaminants and potential cleanup actions. The parties submitted draft documents with respect to the RI/FS to the EPA in 2014 and 2015 and seek to finalize such documents by the end of 2017. Cost estimates for the various alternatives at the Site range from

$365 million

to

$3.2 billion

.

In April 2014, the EPA issued its proposed, independent evaluation of remediation alternatives for a portion of the Site. The EPA's preferred plan for this portion of the Site would involve dredging bank to bank and installing an engineered cap at an estimated cost of

$1.7 billion

. The parties involved have submitted comments to the EPA challenging the science, scope, necessity and viability of the EPA's proposed plan as the EPA's preferred remedy for this portion of the Site is inconsistent with the remedy being developed in the RI/FS for the full Site. The EPA will evaluate all the inputs and is expected to issue a final decision concerning this portion of the Site in 2016. Any subsequent order from the EPA requiring clean-up actions could be judicially challenged.

While the final remedy remains uncertain, the Company has found no evidence that it contributed any of the primary contaminants of concern to the Passaic River. The Company is vigorously defending this matter and currently believes that its ultimate allocable share of the cleanup costs, estimated at substantially less than

1%

, will not be material.

17. Stockholders' Equity

Common Stock

The Company's Board of Directors follows a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company's Common Stock, unless the Company's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. The amount available to pay cash dividends is restricted by the Company's Amended Credit Agreement and the Indentures.

The Company's Board of Directors approved increases in the Company's Common Stock cash dividend rates as follows:

On

February 4, 2016

, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.30

per share on its Common Stock amounting to

$44 million

. The cash dividend is for the period from

November 1, 2015

to

January 31, 2016

and will be paid on

February 26, 2016

to holders of record as of

February 16, 2016

.

Treasury Stock

The Company's Board of Directors authorizes repurchases of Common Stock from time to time. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.



The share repurchase activity pursuant to this authorization is as follows:

______________________________

(1)

The years ended

December 31, 2015

and


exclude

9,264

and

6,021

shares, respectively, withheld from an executive officer to cover statutory minimum withholding requirements for personal income taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock. Restricted stock awards are considered outstanding at the time of issuance. Accordingly, the shares withheld are treated as treasury shares.

(2)

These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program began in February 2008 and does not have an expiration date. In

September 2015

, the Board of Directors approved a new

$1.0 billion

share repurchase authorization.

The purchase of treasury stock reduces the number of shares outstanding. The repurchased shares may be used by the Company for compensation programs utilizing the Company's stock and other corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders' equity.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net



Adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, are as follows:

18. Other (Charges) Gains, Net

______________________________

(1)

Includes

$1 million

of special termination benefits included in Benefit obligations in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and is included in the Company's Industrial Specialties segment.


During the

year ended

December 31, 2015

, the Company recorded

$21 million

of employee termination benefits related to the Company's ongoing efforts to align its businesses around its core value drivers. In addition, the Company recorded

$24 million

of employee termination benefits related to a

50%

capacity reduction at its Lanaken, Belgium acetate tow facility (

Note 4

).

In addition, during the

year ended

December 31, 2015

, the Company recorded

$6 million

of employee termination benefits and

$1 million

of long-lived asset impairment losses related to the closure of its VAE emulsions facility in Tarragona, Spain (

Note 4

). In addition, the Company recorded

$1 million

of employee termination benefits and

$1 million

of long-lived asset



impairment losses related to the closure of its VAE emulsions facility in Meredosia, Illinois (

Note 4

). The long-lived asset impairment losses related to both VAE facilities were measured at the dates of impairment to write-off the related property, plant and equipment at each facility (

Note 2

and

Note 4

).

During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company determined its ethanol production unit at its acetyl facility in Nanjing, China should be assessed for impairment based on market conditions affecting demand for ethanol and downstream products, the cost to operate the unit and contractual obligations. As a result, the Company concluded that certain long-lived ethanol related assets were fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded long-lived impairment losses, measured at the date of impairment (

Note 2

), of

$123 million

to fully write-off certain ethanol related assets. The Nanjing, China asset impairment is included in the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment.

In December 2015, the Company made a payment terminating an existing agreement with a raw materials supplier in Singapore and recognized a

$174 million

charge, which reflects a discounted amount previously owed under that contract. This termination payment was determined not to have future economic benefit, and the contract's original terms substantially contributed to cumulative losses which resulted in a full impairment of the production assets in 2013. This charge is recorded in Other (charges) gains net, which is included in the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment.


During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company received consideration of

$8 million

in connection with the settlement of a claim against a bankrupt supplier. The Company also recorded

$12 million

of damages in connection with the settlement of a claim by a raw materials supplier. These commercial dispute resolutions are included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment. In addition, the Company recovered

$15 million

from an arbitration award against a former utility operator at its cellulose derivatives manufacturing facility in Narrows, Virginia, which is included in the Consumer Specialties segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company recorded

$4 million

of employee termination benefits related to the closure of its acetic anhydride facility in Roussillon, France and its vinyl acetate monomer ("VAM") facility in Tarragona, Spain. In addition, the Company recorded

$2 million

of contract termination adjustments related to the closure of its VAM facility in Tarragona, Spain.


During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded

$6 million

of employee termination benefits,

$3 million

of contract termination costs and

$3 million

of long-lived asset impairment losses related to the December 2013 closure of its acetic anhydride facility in Roussillon, France. In addition, the Company recorded

$14 million

of employee termination benefits,

$30 million

of contract termination costs and

$31 million

of long-lived asset impairment losses as a result of the December 2013 closure of its VAM facility in Tarragona, Spain. The long-lived asset impairment losses related to both the Company's Roussillon acetic anhydride facility and Tarragona VAM facility were measured at the dates of impairment to fully write-off the related property, plant and equipment at both facilities (

Note 2

).

During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the Company determined its Singapore acetic acid production unit should be assessed for impairment based on local market conditions affecting demand for acetic acid and downstream products, the cost to operate the unit, contractual obligations and an interim arbitration ruling. As a result, the Company concluded that the long-lived assets at its Singapore acetic acid production unit were fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment losses, measured at the date of impairment, of

$46 million

to fully write-off the related property, plant and equipment. The Singapore acetic acid operations are included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment (

Note 2

).



The changes in the restructuring reserves by business segment are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Includes a

$13 million

non-cash reduction to take-or-pay contract termination penalties.

19. Income Taxes

Income Tax Provision

Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before tax by jurisdiction are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Includes aggregate earnings generated by operations in Bermuda, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Hong Kong of

$330 million

,

$308 million

and

$275 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively, which have an aggregate effective income tax rate of

6.1%

,

4.8%

and

4.0%

for each year, respectively.



The income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:

A reconciliation of the significant differences between the US federal statutory tax rate of

35%

and the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations is as follows:

Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of

$3.9 billion

as of

December 31, 2015

as such earnings have been permanently reinvested in the business or may be remitted substantially free of incremental US federal tax liability. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The higher effective tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2015

is primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance due to an increase in losses in jurisdictions with no tax benefit. The increase in losses primarily relates to a

$123 million

long-lived asset impairment recorded to fully write-off certain ethanol related assets at the Company's acetyl facility in Nanjing, China and a

$174 million

charge related to the termination of a raw materials contract with a supplier in Singapore (

Note 18

). The tax impact of these events was partially offset by decreases in uncertain tax positions of

$29 million

due to audit closures and technical jurisdictional clarifications. The effective tax rate was comparable for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and 2013.

In February 2015, the Company established a centralized European headquarters for the purpose of improving the operational efficiencies and profitability of its European operations and certain global product lines. These activities directly impacted the Company's mix of earnings and product flows and resulted in both favorable and unfavorable tax rate impacts in the



jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These impacts have been reflected in Other foreign tax rate differentials included in the reconciliation of the significant differences between the US federal statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the consolidated deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Includes deferred tax asset valuation allowances for the Company's deferred tax assets in the

US, Luxembourg, Spain, China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Canada and France

. These valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforward benefits and other net deferred tax assets, all of which may not be realizable.

For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, the valuation allowance increased by

$35 million

primarily due to

$124 million

of losses generated with no currently realizable income tax benefit, primarily associated with the long-lived asset impairment recorded to fully write-off certain ethanol assets at the Company's acetyl facility in Nanjing, China and the termination of a raw materials contract with a supplier in Singapore (

Note 18

), partially offset by

$22 million

related to exchange rate changes and net operating loss expirations and utilization of previously unbenefited loss carryforwards of

$67 million

.

Legislative Changes

In October 2013, the Mexican National Congress passed new tax legislation. Among other things, the new legislation maintains a corporate tax rate of

30%

, eliminates the tax consolidation rules and repeals the business flat tax ("IETU") for years beginning after

December 31, 2013

. The Company was subject to the IETU in 2013 and for prior periods and is now required to record deferred income taxes on an income tax basis. As a result, the Company realized a deferred income tax benefit of

$46 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

The Company has historically filed consolidated income tax returns in Mexico. Under the new tax legislation, the Company was required to recapture previously deferred income taxes related to income tax loss carryforwards, intercompany dividends and differences between consolidated and individual company taxable earnings. The Company recorded additional tax expense of

$27 million

related to these new rules for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, resulting in a net income tax benefit of

$19 million

.



Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company has US federal net operating loss carryforwards of

$26 million

that are subject to limitation. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in


. At

December 31, 2015

, the Company also had state net operating loss carryforwards, net of federal tax impact, of

$47 million

,

$46 million

of which are offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertain recoverability. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of

December 31, 2015

of

$2.3 billion

primarily for Luxembourg, Spain, Canada, China, Singapore and the United Kingdom, with various expiration dates. Net operating losses in China have various carryforward periods and began to expire in


. Net operating losses in most other foreign jurisdictions do not have an expiration date.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Activity related to uncertain tax positions is as follows:

______________________________

(1)

This amount reflects interest on uncertain tax positions, the impact of currency and release of certain tax positions as a result of audit closure that was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company also paid an additional

$12 million

of previously accrued amounts due to settlements of tax examinations.

The Company primarily operates in the US, Germany, Belgium, Canada, China, Mexico and Singapore. Examinations are ongoing in a number of these jurisdictions, including Germany for the years 2005 to 2012 and the US for the years 2009 through 2012. The Company's US federal income tax returns for 2004 and forward are open for examination under statute. The Company's German corporate tax returns for 2005 and forward are open for examination under statute. In addition, certain statutes of limitations are scheduled to expire in the near future. The decrease in uncertain tax positions for the year-ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to audit closures and technical judicial clarifications. It is reasonably possible that a further change in the unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months related to the settlement of one or more of these audits. Amounts immediately determinable have been reflected in the current portion of uncertain tax positions.

In December 2013, the French Tax Authority ("FTA") issued audit assessment claims against the Company that could result in incremental tax expense of

€81 million

, including interest and penalties. The assessment suggests that for the years 2008 to 2010, the Company transferred value from its otherwise profitable facility in Pardies, France to subsidize other global manufacturing operations outside of France. During the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Company completed a settlement of the examination with the FTA. As a result of the settlement, the Company utilized

€141 million

of previously unbenefited net operating loss carryforwards. The settlement did not result in any material additional cash tax liability.



20. Management Compensation Plans

Rent expense recorded under all operating leases is as follows:

22. Derivative Financial Instruments

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company fixes the LIBOR portion of its US dollar denominated variable rate borrowings (

Note 14

) with interest rate swap derivative arrangements as follows:

Cross-currency Swaps

In March 2015, the Company settled its cross-currency swap agreements with notional values of

$250 million

/

€193 million

, expiring on

September 11, 2020

, and

$225 million

/

€162 million

, expiring on

April 17, 2019

, in exchange for cash of

$88 million

. The Company recorded a net loss of

$1 million

, which is included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the same category of the consolidated statement of cash flows as the cash flows from the items being hedged. Accordingly, the settlement of the cross-currency swap agreements is included in Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the

year ended

December 31, 2015

.

Foreign Currency Forwards and Swaps

Each of the contracts included in the table below will have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables, receivables, intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement. The total US dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency are as follows:



Gross notional values of the foreign currency forwards and swaps are as follows:

Hedging activity for interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is as follows:

Information regarding changes in the fair value of the Company's derivative and non-derivative instruments is as follows:

______________________________

(1)

In December 2014, the Company dedesignated as cash flow hedges a notional value of

$500 million

US dollar interest rate swap agreements expiring

January 2, 2016

.

(2)

During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company designated the Euro-based principal amount of its Term C-2 loan and its Term C-3 loan as a net investment hedge of its investment in a wholly-owned international subsidiary whose functional currency is the Euro to mitigate the volatility caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US dollar. During the three months ended

December 31, 2015

, the Company dedesignated the Euro-based principal amount of its Term C-3 loan as a net investment hedge.

See

Note 23 - Fair Value Measurements

for additional information regarding the fair value of the Company's derivative agreements.



Certain of the Company's foreign currency forwards and swaps and interest rate swaps permit the Company to net settle all contracts with the counterparty through a single payment in an agreed upon currency in the event of default or early termination of the contract, similar to a master netting arrangement. The Company's interest rate swap agreements are subject to cross collateralization under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement entered into in conjunction with the Term loan borrowings (

Note 14

).

Information regarding the gross amounts of the Company's derivative instruments and the amounts offset in the consolidated balance sheets is as follows:

23. Fair Value Measurements

The Company's financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (

Note 2

) as follows:

Derivatives.

Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps and are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are observable in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.



______________________________

(1)

Included

in the consolidated balance sheets at carrying amount. During the three months ended

December 31, 2015

, the Company dedesignated the Euro-based principal amount of its Term C-3 loan as a net investment hedge.

Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are as follows:

In general, the cost investments included in the table above are not publicly traded and their fair values are not readily determinable; however, the Company believes the carrying values approximate or are less than the fair values. Insurance contracts in nonqualified trusts consist of long-term fixed income securities, which are valued using independent vendor pricing models with observable inputs in the active market and therefore represent a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of long-term debt is based on valuations from third-party banks and market quotations and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The fair value of obligations under capital leases, which are included in long-term debt, is based on



lease payments and discount rates, which are not observable in the market and therefore represents a Level 3 fair value measurement.

As of

December 31, 2015

and


, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payables, short-term borrowings and the current installments of long-term debt approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These items have been excluded from the table with the exception of the current installments of long-term debt.

24. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements, leases, settlement agreements and various agreements with affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, others do not provide such limitations.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the occurrence of unpredictable future events, the future costs associated with them cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims that have been brought to its attention. These known obligations include the following:

•

Demerger Obligations

In connection with the Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, for various liabilities under the demerger agreement, including for environmental liabilities associated with contamination arising either from environmental damage in general ("Category A") or under


divestiture agreements entered into by Hoechst prior to the demerger ("Category B") (

Note 16

).

The Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, is capped under Category B at

€250 million

. If and to the extent the environmental damage should exceed

€750 million

in aggregate, the Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors applies, but is then limited to

33.33%

of the remediation cost without further limitations. Cumulative payments under the divestiture agreements as of

December 31, 2015

are

$71 million

. Most of the divestiture agreements have become time barred and/or any notified environmental damage claims have been partially settled.

The Company has also undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for (i)

33.33%

of any and all Category A liabilities that result from Hoechst being held as the responsible party pursuant to public law or current or future environmental law or by third parties pursuant to private or public law related to contamination and (ii) liabilities that Hoechst is required to discharge, including tax liabilities, which are associated with businesses that were included in the demerger but were not demerged due to legal restrictions on the transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not been requested by Hoechst to make any payments in connection with this indemnification. Accordingly, the Company has not made any payments to Hoechst and its legal successors.

Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the lack of requests for indemnification, the Company cannot estimate the Possible Loss for the remaining demerger obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.

•

Divestiture Obligations

The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees represent standard contractual terms associated with typical divestiture agreements and, other than environmental liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the Company to any significant risk (

Note 16

).

The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, which extend through


. The aggregate amount of outstanding indemnifications and guarantees provided for under these agreements is

$202 million

as of

December 31, 2015

. Other agreements do not provide for any monetary or time limitations.



Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the number of requests for indemnification or other payment received by the Company, the Company cannot estimate the Possible Loss for the remaining divestiture obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.

Purchase Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various purchase commitments for goods and services. The Company maintains a number of "take-or-pay" contracts for purchases of raw materials, utilities and other services. Certain of the contracts contain a contract termination buy-out provision that allows for the Company to exit the contracts for amounts less than the remaining take-or-pay obligations. The Company does not expect to incur any material losses under take-or-pay contractual arrangements. Additionally, the Company has other outstanding commitments representing maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts and software agreements. As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of

$3.0 billion

, which extend through


.

Contingencies

The Company is involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of business, relating to such matters as product liability, land disputes, commercial contracts, employment, antitrust, intellectual property, workers' compensation, chemical exposure, asbestos exposure, trade compliance, prior acquisitions and divestitures, claims of legacy stockholders, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment. The Company is actively defending those matters where the Company is named as a defendant. The Company does not believe any of the potential outcomes from these matters would be material to our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

28. Consolidating Guarantor Financial Information

The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US (the "Issuer") and are guaranteed by Celanese Corporation (the "Parent Guarantor") and the Subsidiary Guarantors (

Note 14

). The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors are

100%

owned subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. The Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors have guaranteed the Notes fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally.

For cash management purposes, the Company transfers cash between the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors and non-guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Company's outstanding debt, Common Stock dividends and Common Stock repurchases. The consolidating statements of cash flow present such intercompany financing activities, contributions and dividends consistent with how such activity would be presented in a stand-alone statement of cash flows.

The Company has not presented separate financial information and other disclosures for each of its Subsidiary Guarantors because it believes such financial information and other disclosures would not provide investors with any additional information that would be material in evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees.

For the year ended December 31, 2015,

$54 million

in interest expense was allocated from the Issuer to Subsidiary Guarantors.

The consolidating financial information for the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the non-guarantors are as follows:
