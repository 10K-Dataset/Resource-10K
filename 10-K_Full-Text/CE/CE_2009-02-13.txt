    markets, while our geographic diversity reduces the potential
    impact of



volatility in any individual country or region. We have a
    strong, growing presence in Asia, particularly in China, and we
    have a defined strategy to continue this growth. For more
    information regarding our financial information with respect to
    our geographic areas, see Note 25 to the consolidated
    financial statements.

    Strategies

Our strategic foundation is based on the following four pillars
    which are focused on increasing operating cash flows, improving
    profitability, delivering high return on investments and
    increasing shareholder value:

Focus

We focus on businesses where we have a sustainable and proven
    competitive advantage. We continue to optimize our business
    portfolio in order to achieve market, cost and technology
    leadership while expanding our product mix into higher
    value-added products.

Investment

We leverage and build on advantaged positions that optimize our
    portfolio of products. In order to increase our competitive
    advantage, we have invested in our core group of businesses
    through acquisitions; growth in Asia bolstered by our integrated
    chemical complex in Nanjing, China; and new applications of our
    advanced engineered polymers products.

Redeployment

We divest non-core assets and revitalize underperforming
    businesses. We have divested or exited businesses where we no
    longer maintain a competitive advantage. We also continue to
    make key strategic decisions to revitalize businesses that have
    significant potential for improved performance and enhanced
    efficiency.

Underlying all of these strategies is a culture of execution and
    productivity. We continually seek ways to reduce costs, increase
    productivity and improve process technology. Our commitment to
    operational excellence is an integral part of our strategy to
    maintain our cost advantage and productivity leadership.

Business
    Segments

Advanced
    Engineered Materials

Our Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high-performance technical
    polymers.



Advanced Engineered Materials’ technical polymers have
    chemical and physical properties enabling them, among other
    things, to withstand extreme temperatures, resist chemical
    reactions with solvents and withstand fracturing or stretching.
    These products are used in a wide range of performance-demanding
    applications in the automotive and electronics sectors as well
    as in other consumer and industrial goods.

Advanced Engineered Materials works in concert with its
    customers to enable innovations and develop new or enhanced
    products. Advanced Engineered Materials focuses its efforts on
    developing new markets and applications for its product lines,
    often developing custom formulations to satisfy the technical
    and processing requirements of a customer’s applications.
    For example, Advanced Engineered Materials has collaborated with
    fuel system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with the
    chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure
    to hot diesel fuels in the new generation of common rail diesel
    engines. The product can also be used in automotive fuel sender
    units where it remains stable at the high operating temperatures
    present in direct-injection diesel engines and can meet the
    requirements of the new generation of bio fuels.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ customer base consists
    primarily of a large number of plastic molders and component
    suppliers, which typically supply original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”). Advanced Engineered Materials
    works with these molders and component suppliers as well as
    directly with the OEMs to develop and improve specialized
    applications and systems.

Prices for most of these products, particularly specialized
    product grades for targeted applications, generally reflect the
    value added in complex polymer chemistry, precision formulation
    and compounding, and the extensive application development
    services provided. These specialized product lines are not
    typically susceptible to cyclical swings in pricing.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ sales in the Asian market
    are made directly and through its strategic affiliates.
    Polyplastics, KEPCO and Fortron Industries are accounted for
    under the equity method and therefore not included in Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ consolidated net sales. If Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ portion of the sales made by these
    strategic affiliates were included in the table above, the
    percentage of sales sold in Asia/Australia would be
    substantially higher. A number of Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ POM customers, particularly in the appliance,
    electrical components and certain sections of the
    electronics/telecommunications fields, have moved tooling and
    molding operations to Asia, particularly southern China. In
    addition to our Advanced Engineered Materials affiliates, we
    directly service Asian demand offering our customers global
    solutions.

    consumer product manufacturers and suppliers to the automotive
    industry. These customers primarily produce engineered products,
    and Advanced Engineered Materials collaborates with its
    customers to assist in developing and improving specialized
    applications and systems. Advanced Engineered Materials has
    long-standing relationships with most of its major customers,
    but also uses distributors for its major products, as well as a
    number of electronic marketplaces to reach a larger customer
    base. For most of Advanced Engineered Materials’ product
    lines, contracts with customers typically have a term of one to
    two years.

Competition

Advanced Engineered Materials’ principal competitors
    include BASF AG (“BASF”), E. I. DuPont de Nemours and
    Company (“DuPont”), DSM N.V., Sabic Innovative

    Phillips Chemical Company, L.P., Braskem S.A., Lanxess AG,
    Teijin, Sumitomo, Inc. and Toray Industries Inc.

Consumer
    Specialties

The Consumer Specialties segment consists of our Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. Our Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow, which is used in
    the production of filter products. We



also produce acetate flake which is processed into acetate fiber
    in the form of a tow band. Our Nutrinova business produces and
    sells
    Sunett

®

,

    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical
    industries.

Key
    Products

Acetate tow is used primarily in cigarette filters. We produce
    acetate flake by processing wood pulp with acetic anhydride. We
    purchase wood pulp that is made from reforested trees from major
    suppliers and produce acetic anhydride internally. The acetate
    flake is then further processed into acetate fiber in the form
    of a tow band. According to the 2008 Stanford Research Institute
    International Chemical Economics Handbook, we are the
    world’s leading producer of acetate tow, including
    production of our China ventures.

Sales of acetate tow amounted to approximately 12%, 11% and 9%
    of our consolidated net sales for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We have an approximate 30% interest in three manufacturing China
    ventures, which are accounted for as cost method investments
    (Note 8) that produce acetate flake and tow. Our partner in
    each of the ventures is the Chinese

state-owned

tobacco entity, China National Tobacco Corporation. In addition,

    highest quality producer of this product, to develop new product
    applications and expand into new markets.

Nutrinova’s food ingredients business consists of the
    production and sale of food protection ingredients, such as
    sorbic acid and sorbates, and high intensity sweeteners
    worldwide. Nutrinova’s food protection ingredients are
    mainly used in foods, beverages and personal care products. The
    primary raw materials for these products are ketene and
    crotonaldehyde. Sorbates pricing is extremely sensitive to
    demand and industry capacity and is not necessarily dependent on
    the prices of raw materials.

Facilities

Acetate Products has production sites in the United States,
    Mexico, the United Kingdom and Belgium, and participates in
    three manufacturing ventures in China.

Nutrinova has production facilities in Germany, as well as sales

    products, including acetic acid, VAM, acetic anhydride and
    acetate esters. Other chemicals produced in this segment are
    organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical,
    agricultural and chemical products.

Key
    Products

Acetyls.

Acetyls products include acetic acid,
    VAM, acetic anhydride and acetaldehyde. Acetic acid is primarily
    used to manufacture VAM, PTA and other acetyl derivatives. VAM
    is used in a variety of adhesives, paints, films, coatings and
    textiles. Acetic anhydride is a raw material used in the
    production of cellulose acetate, detergents and pharmaceuticals.
    Acetaldehyde is a major feedstock for the production of polyols.
    Acetaldehyde is also used in other organic compounds such as
    pyridines, which are used in agricultural products. We
    manufacture acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride for our own
    use, as well as for sale to third parties.

Acetic acid and VAM, our basic acetyl intermediates products,
    are impacted by global supply/demand fundamentals and are
    cyclical in nature. The principal raw materials in these
    products are ethylene, which we purchase from numerous sources;
    carbon monoxide, which we purchase under long-term contracts;
    and methanol, which we purchase under long-term and short-term
    contracts. With the exception of carbon monoxide, these raw
    materials are commodity products available from a wide variety
    of sources.



Our production of acetyl products employs leading proprietary
    and licensed technologies, including our proprietary

Solvents and Derivatives.

Solvents and
    derivatives products include a variety of solvents, formaldehyde
    and other chemicals, which in turn are used in the manufacture
    of paints, coatings, adhesives and other products.

Many solvents and derivatives products are derived from our
    production of acetic acid. Primary products are:

•

Ethyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in
    coatings, inks and adhesives and in the manufacture of
    photographic films and coated papers; and

•

Butyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in inks,
    pharmaceuticals and perfume.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde derivative products are
    derivatives of methanol and are made up of the following
    products:

•

Formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde and formcels are primarily used
    to produce adhesive resins for plywood, particle board,
    coatings, POM engineering resins and a compound used in making
    polyurethane;

•

Amines such as methyl amines, monisopropynol amines and butyl
    amines are used in agrochemicals, herbicides and the treatment
    of rubber and water; and

•

Special solvents, such as crotonaldehyde, which are used by the
    Nutrinova business line for the production of sorbates, as well
    as raw materials for the fragrance and food ingredients industry.

Solvents and derivatives are commodity products characterized by
    cyclicality in pricing. The principal raw materials used in
    solvents and derivatives products are acetic acid, various
    alcohols, methanol, ethylene and ammonia. We manufacture many of
    these raw materials for our own use as well as for sales to
    third parties, including our competitors in the solvents and
    derivatives business. We purchase ethylene from a variety of
    sources. We manufacture acetaldehyde in Europe for our own use,
    as well as for sale to third parties.

Sales from acetyl products amounted to approximately 35%, 34%
    and 33% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales from
    solvents and derivatives products amounted to approximately 12%,
    12% and 13% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended

Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities such as legal,
    accounting and treasury functions, interest income and expense
    associated with our financing activities, and our captive
    insurance companies. Our two wholly-owned captive insurance
    companies are a key component of our global risk management
    program, as well as a form of self-insurance for our property,
    liability and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance
    companies issue insurance policies to our subsidiaries to
    provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the
    insurance market and to lower long-term insurance costs by
    avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory
    fees. The captive insurance companies retain risk at levels
    approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from
    third parties to limit the net risk retained. One of the captive
    insurance companies also insures certain third-party risks.



Investments

We have a significant portfolio of strategic investments,
    including a number of ventures in Asia, North America and
    Europe. In aggregate, these strategic investments enjoy
    significant sales, earnings and cash flow. We have entered into
    these strategic investments in order to gain access to local
    markets, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we
    believe have significant future business potential. See
    Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

Major
    Equity Method Investments

Korea Engineering Plastics Co. Ltd.

Founded in
    1987, KEPCO is the leading producer of polyacetal in South
    Korea. Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. owns 40% and
    Mitsubishi Corporation owns 10% of KEPCO. KEPCO operates a POM
    plant in Ulsan, South Korea and participates with Polyplastics
    and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM
    facility in Nantong, China.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd.

Polyplastics is a
    leading supplier of engineered plastics in the Asia-Pacific
    region. Polyplastics’ principal production facilities are
    located in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and China. We believe
    Polyplastics is the largest producer and marketer of POM in the
    Asia-Pacific region.

Fortron Industries LLC.

Fortron Industries LLC
    is a leading global producer of PPS. Production facilities are
    located in Wilmington, North Carolina. We believe Fortron has
    the leading technology in linear polymer applications.

Major
    Cost Method Investments

National Methanol Co. (“Ibn
    Sina”).

With production facilities in Saudi
    Arabia, National Methanol Co. represents approximately 2% of the
    world’s methanol production capacity and is the
    world’s eighth largest producer of MTBE. Methanol and MTBE
    are key global commodity chemical products. We indirectly own a
    25% interest in National Methanol Co. through CTE
    Petrochemicals, a joint venture with Texas Eastern Arabian
    Corporation Ltd., with the remainder held by SABIC (50%). SABIC
    has responsibility for all product marketing.

China Acetate Products ventures.

We hold
    approximately 30% ownership interests (50% board representation)
    in three separate Acetate Products production entities in China:
    the Nantong, Kunming and Zhuhai Cellulose Fiber Companies. In
    each instance, the Chinese state-owned tobacco entity, China
    National Tobacco Corporation controls the remainder. The China
    ventures fund operations using operating cash flows.

These cost investments where we own greater than a 20% ownership
    interest are accounted for under the cost method of accounting
    because we cannot exercise significant influence over these
    entities. We determined that we



cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to
    local government investment in and influence over these
    entities, limitations on our involvement in the day-to-day
    operations and the present inability of the entities to provide
    timely financial information prepared in accordance with US
    generally accepted accounting principles.

Other
    Equity Investments

InfraServs.

We hold ownership interests in
    several InfraServ entities located in Germany. InfraServs own
    and develop industrial parks and provide

on-site

general and administrative support to tenants. The table below

Raw
    Materials and Energy

We purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources
    in many countries for use in our production processes. We have a
    policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of
    supply for materials. However, some of our individual plants may
    have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials,
    such as carbon monoxide, steam and acetaldehyde. Although we
    have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials,
    there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not
    affect our raw material supply. Even if we have multiple sources
    of supply for a raw material, there can be no assurance that
    these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier.
    There cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be
    affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of
    supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole
    supplier. In addition, the price of raw materials varies, often
    substantially, from year to year.

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are
    commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply/demand
    fundamentals change. Our production facilities rely largely on
    fuel oil, natural gas and electricity for energy. Most of the
    raw materials for our European operations are centrally
    purchased by one of our subsidiaries, which also buys raw
    materials on behalf of third parties. We manage our exposure
    through forward purchase contracts, long-term supply agreements
    and multi-year purchasing and sales agreements. During 2008, we
    did not enter into any commodity financial derivative contracts.
    See Note 2 and Note 22 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

We also currently purchase and lease supplies of various
    precious metals, such as rhodium, used as catalysts for the
    manufacture of Acetyl Intermediates products. For precious
    metals, the leases are distributed between a minimum of three
    lessors per product and are divided into several contracts.

Research
    and Development

All of our businesses conduct research and development
    activities to increase competitiveness. Our businesses are
    innovation-oriented and conduct research and development
    activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production
    technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new
    products and applications. We consider the amount spent during
    each of the last three fiscal years on research and development
    activities to be adequate to drive our strategic initiatives.

Intellectual
    Property

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    product and process developments in our major markets. Patents
    may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product
    uses. We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means
    of protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names
    become more important once the corresponding patents have
    expired. We protect our trademarks vigorously against
    infringement and also seek to register design protection where
    appropriate.

In most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new
    substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications
    and production processes. However, we do business in regions of
    the world where intellectual property



protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We maintain
    strict information security policies and procedures wherever we
    do business. Such information security policies and procedures
    include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and
    safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee
    awareness training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors and
    vigorously challenge patent and trademark infringement. For
    example, Acetyl Intermediates maintains a strict patent
    enforcement strategy, which has resulted in favorable outcomes
    in a number of patent infringement matters in Europe, Asia and
    the United States. We are currently pursuing a number of matters
    relating to the infringement of our acetic acid patents. Some of
    our earlier acetic acid patents expired in 2007; other patent
    applications covering acetic acid are presently pending.

Neither our business as a whole nor any particular segment is
    materially dependent upon any one particular patent, trademark,
    copyright or trade secret.

Environmental
    and Other Regulation

Matters pertaining to environmental and other regulations are
    discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations, and Note 16 and Note 23 to
    the consolidated financial statements.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    8,350 employees worldwide from continuing operations,
    compared to 8,400 as of December 31, 2007. This represents
    a decrease of less than 1%. The following table sets forth the
    approximate number of employees on a continuing basis as of
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Many of our employees are unionized, particularly in Germany,
    Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Belgium and France. However, in the
    United States, less than one quarter of our employees are
    unionized. Moreover, in Germany and France, wages and general
    working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated
    collective bargaining agreements. Within the limits established
    by these agreements, our various subsidiaries negotiate directly
    with the unions and other labor organizations, such as
    workers’ councils, representing the employees. Collective
    bargaining agreements between the German chemical employers
    associations and unions relating to remuneration generally have
    a term of one year, while in the United States a three year term
    for collective bargaining agreements is typical. We offer
    comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and
    believe our relations with employees are satisfactory.



Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the
    level of future sales activity. In general, we do not
    manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production
    and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders
    as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe
    that backlog information is not material to understanding our
    overall business and should not be considered a reliable
    indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of
    revenue or financial performance.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Many factors could have an effect on our financial condition,
    cash flows and results of operations. We are subject to various
    risks resulting from changing economic, environmental,
    political, industry, business and financial conditions. The
    factors described below represent our principal risks.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The
    worldwide economic downturn and difficult conditions in the
    global capital and credit markets have affected and may continue
    to adversely affect our business, as well as the industries of
    many of our customers and suppliers, which are cyclical in
    nature. We do not expect these conditions to improve in the near
    future.

Some of the markets in which our end-use customers participate,
    such as the automotive, electrical, construction and textile
    industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us
    which is beyond our control. These markets are highly
    competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use markets, and
    may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for
    and pricing of our products.

Recent declines in consumer and business confidence and
    spending, together with severe reductions in the availability
    and cost of credit and volatility in the capital and credit
    markets, have adversely affected the business and economic
    environment in which we operate and the profitability of our
    business. Our business is exposed to risks associated with the
    creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business
    partners. In particular, we are exposed to risks associated with
    the ongoing decline of the automotive, textile and housing
    markets. These conditions have resulted in financial instability
    or other adverse effects at many of our suppliers, customers or
    business partners. The consequences of such adverse effects
    could include the interruption of production at the facilities
    of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of
    customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to
    obtain financing to purchase our products, delays or
    interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and
    bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of
    these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability
    and financial condition.

Moreover, the current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the
    availability of liquidity and credit to fund or support the
    continuation and expansion of business operations worldwide.
    Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in
    some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Continued
    disruption of the credit markets has affected and could continue
    to adversely affect our customer’s access to credit which
    supports the continuation



and expansion of their businesses worldwide and could result in
    contract cancellations or suspensions, payment delays or
    defaults by our customers.

We are
    a company with operations around the world and are exposed to
    general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks
    in the countries in which we have significant
    operations.

We operate in the global market and have customers in many
    countries. We have major facilities primarily located in North
    America, Europe and Asia, and hold interests in ventures that
    operate in Germany, China, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
    Our principal customers are similarly global in scope, and the
    prices of our most significant products are typically world
    market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results
    are affected, directly and indirectly, by world economic,
    political and regulatory conditions.

In addition to the worldwide economic downturn, conditions such
    as the uncertainties associated with war, terrorist activities,
    epidemics, pandemics or political instability in any of the
    countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays
    or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and
    products, as well as increasing security costs, insurance
    premiums and other expenses. These conditions could also result
    in or lengthen economic recession in the United States, Europe,
    Asia or elsewhere.

Moreover, changes in laws or regulations, such as unexpected
    changes in regulatory requirements (including import or export
    licensing requirements), or changes in the reporting
    requirements of the United States, German or European Union
    (“EU”) governmental agencies, could increase the cost
    of doing business in these regions. Any of these conditions may
    have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole
    and may result in volatile current and future prices for our
    securities, including our stock.

In particular, we have invested significant resources in China
    and other Asian countries. This region’s growth has slowed
    and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated
    with our investment there and our financial results may be
    adversely impacted.

We are
    subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the
    prices and availability of key raw materials and
    energy.

We purchase significant amounts of natural gas, ethylene and
    methanol from third parties for use in our production of basic
    chemicals in the Acetyl Intermediates segment, principally
    formaldehyde, acetic acid and VAM. We use a portion of our
    output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in the production
    of further products in all our segments. We also purchase
    significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of
    cellulose acetate in the Consumer Specialties segment. The price
    of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of
    such item and may increase significantly as a result of
    production disruptions or strikes. For example, the unplanned
    shutdown of our Clear Lake, Texas facility together with other
    tight supply conditions caused a shortage of acetic acid and
    increased the price for such product during 2007.

We are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw
    materials and energy. Although we have agreements providing for
    the supply of natural gas, ethylene, wood pulp, electricity and
    fuel oil, the contractual prices for these raw materials and
    energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile.
    Factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices
    in the past and which may do so in the future include:

•

Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from
    growing uses or new uses;

•

Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, strike
    action or involuntary shutdowns;

•

The general level of business and economic activity; and

•

The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.

If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy
    and raw material costs, or if such commodities were unavailable,
    it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial
    results.



Failure
    to develop new products and production technologies or to
    implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives
    successfully may harm our competitive position.

Our operating results, especially in our Consumer Specialties
    and Advanced Engineered Materials segments, depend significantly
    on the development of commercially viable new products, product
    grades and applications, as well as production technologies. If
    we are unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and
    production processes in the future, our competitive position and
    operating results may be negatively affected. Likewise, we have
    undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all
    segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate
    cost savings. These initiatives may not be completed or
    beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities
    may not be realized.

Recent
    federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain
    chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be
    proposed in the future could, if passed into law, require us to
    relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to
    alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical
    products, thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Regulations have recently been issued by the Department of
    Homeland Security (“DHS”) aimed at decreasing the
    risk, and effects, of potential terrorist attacks on chemical
    plants located within the United States. Pursuant to these
    regulations, these goals would be accomplished in part through
    the requirement that certain high-priority facilities develop a
    prevention, preparedness, and response plan after conducting a
    vulnerability assessment. In addition, companies may be required
    to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals
    and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and
    prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in
    order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a
    terrorist attack. We have registered certain of our sites with
    DHS in accordance with these regulations, and are conducting
    vulnerability assessments for our sites and until that is done
    we cannot state with certainty the costs associated with any
    security plans that DHS may require. These regulations may be
    revised further, and additional legislation may be proposed in
    the future on this topic. It is possible that such future
    legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than
    what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to
    us. We cannot predict the final form of currently pending
    legislation, or other related legislation that may be passed and
    can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations in a future
    reporting period.

Environmental
    regulations and other obligations relating to environmental
    matters could subject us to liability for fines,

clean-ups

and other damages, require us to incur significant costs to
    modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and
    delivery costs.

Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and potential obligations with respect to
    contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our
    operating results. These include obligations related to sites
    currently or formerly owned or operated by us, or where waste
    from our operations was disposed. We also have obligations
    related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and
    transfer agreement between Celanese GmbH and Hoechst, also
    referred to as the demerger agreement, for environmental matters
    arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the
    demerger.

Our operations are subject to extensive international, national,
    state, local and other supranational laws and regulations that
    govern environmental and health and safety matters, including
    the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) and the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”). We
    incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these
    requirements. If we violate them, we can be held liable for
    substantial fines and other sanctions, including limitations on
    our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of
    environmental permits involved. Stricter environmental, safety
    and health laws, regulations and enforcement policies could
    result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations
    on our operations and could subject our handling, manufacture,
    use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more
    rigorous scrutiny than at present. Consequently, compliance with
    these laws and regulations could result in significant capital
    expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, which could
    cause our business and operating results to be less favorable
    than expected.



We are also involved in several claims, lawsuits and
    administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. An
    adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our
    earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period.

Changes
    in environmental, health and safety regulations in the
    jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products could
    lead to a decrease in demand for our products.

New or revised governmental regulations and independent studies
    relating to the effect of our products on health, safety and the
    environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of
    producing our products.

Canada recently included vinyl acetate monomer (“VAM”)
    as one of approximately 200 chemicals being assessed as part of
    the Canadian Government’s Chemicals Management Plan under
    the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (“CEPA”). On
    May 16, 2008, Health Canada published a draft screening
    risk assessment and draft risk management scope document for VAM
    that concluded, using a ’precautionary approach’, that
    VAM be listed as a “toxic substance” under CEPA. On
    January 27, 2009, after consideration of data submitted by
    Celanese and other manufacturers and users of VAM and further
    consideration of a risk assessment prepared by the European
    Union, Health Canada published its final decision overruling its
    May 16, 2008 draft assessment of VAM. Health Canada
    concluded that VAM does not meet the regulatory requirements for
    being listed as a toxic substance under CEPA.

The Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of
    Chemicals (“REACh”), which established a system to
    register and evaluate chemicals manufactured in, or imported to,
    the European Union, became effective on June 1, 2007. VAM
    is one of the chemicals that the European Chemicals Agency
    (“ECHA”) will regulate under REACh. ECHA will likely
    rely on the work of the EU-Working group on classification and
    labeling of dangerous substances. After extensive study, the
    EU-Working Group agreed that VAM should be classified in the EU
    as showing limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect. In
    addition, a risk assessment was performed on VAM by the European
    Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission. Risk reduction
    strategies for human health and the environment were finalized
    without the imposition of any restrictions or burdens atypical
    to an industrial chemical. The EU-Working Group conclusion has
    been reviewed and substantively approved by EU Scientific
    Committee on Health and Environmental Risks.

We can provide no assurance that the EU classifications on VAM
    will not be revised in the future, or that other chemicals we
    produce will not be classified in a manner that would adversely
    affect demand for such products. Such negative classifications
    could have an adverse affect on our business and results of
    operations.

We are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from
    formaldehyde. Several studies have investigated possible links
    between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including
    leukemia. The International Agency for Research on Cancer
    (“IARC”), a private research agency, has reclassified
    formaldehyde from Group 2A (probable human carcinogen) to Group
    1 (known human carcinogen) based on studies linking formaldehyde
    exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer in humans. We
    expect the results of IARC’s review will be examined and
    considered by government agencies with responsibility for
    setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling
    requirements. If such agencies give strong consideration to
    IARC’s findings in setting such standards and requirements,
    it could have an adverse effect on our business.

Other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological
    testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals,
    including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives
    include the Voluntary Children’s Chemical Evaluation
    Program, High Production Volume Chemical Initiative and Chemical
    Assessment and Management Program (“ChAMP”) in the
    United States, as well as various European Commission programs,
    such as REACh.

The above-mentioned assessments in the United States, Canada and
    Europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals
    involved and additional requirements being placed on the
    production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals.
    Such concerns and additional requirements could increase the
    cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and
    otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a
    decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand
    would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results
    of operations.



Our
    production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and
    hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that
    could have a negative effect on our operating
    results.

Our operations are subject to operating risks associated with
    chemical manufacturing, including the related storage and
    transportation of raw materials, products and waste. These risks
    include, among other things, pipeline and storage tank leaks and
    ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or releases of
    toxic or hazardous substances.

These operating risks can cause personal injury, property damage
    and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown
    of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal
    penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt
    production and have a negative effect on the productivity and
    profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our
    operating results and cash flows.

Production
    at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety
    of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our
    products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’
    demands.

A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could
    have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions
    could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters,
    weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems,
    disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government
    regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient
    capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost
    substantially more or may take a significant time to start
    production, each of which could negatively affect our business
    and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing
    facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended
    period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused
    by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our
    customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek other
    suppliers. For example, during 2007, production was disrupted
    for an extended period of time at our Clear Lake, Texas facility
    that produces primarily acetic acid and VAM. The disruption was
    caused by an unplanned outage of our acetic acid unit. Because
    of this disruption, the volumes of our Acetyl Intermediates
    segment were lower than we had expected for 2007 as we were
    unable to fully offset the lost production. Similar outages
    could occur in the future from unexpected disruptions at any of
    our other manufacturing facilities of key products. Such outages
    could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in
    future reporting periods.

We may
    experience unexpected difficulties in the relocation of our
    Ticona plant from Kelsterbach to the Rhine Main area, which may
    increase our costs, delay the transition or disrupt our ability
    to supply our customers.

We have agreed with Frankfurt, Germany Airport
    (“Fraport”) to relocate our Kelsterbach, Germany
    business, resolving several years of legal disputes related to
    the planned Frankfurt airport expansion. As a result of the
    settlement, we will transition Ticona’s operations from
    Kelsterbach to another location in Germany by mid-2011. In July
    2007, we announced that we would relocate the Kelsterbach,
    Germany business to the Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine
    Main area. Over a five-year period, Fraport agreed to pay Ticona
    a total of €670 million to offset the costs associated
    with the transition of the business from its current location
    and the closure of the Kelsterbach plant. While the settlement
    and related payment amount are meant to be cost-neutral and
    represent the actual amount we will require to select a site,
    build new production facilities, demolish old production
    facilities and transition business activities according to
    schedule and without any disruptions to customer supply, we may
    encounter unexpected costs or other difficulties during the
    relocation process that bring the total costs of the relocation
    to an amount greater than the compensation provided by Fraport.
    The relocation of these facilities represents a major logistical
    undertaking, and we may have underestimated the amount that will
    be required to carry out every aspect of the relocation. We may
    lose the services of valuable experienced employees during the
    transition if they decide not to work at the new location. The
    construction of the new facilities may not be complete on time
    or may face cost overruns. If our costs relating to the
    relocation exceed the amount of payments from Fraport or if the
    relocation causes other unexpected difficulties, our expenses
    may increase or supplies to our customers may be disrupted.

If supply to our customers is disrupted for an extended period,
    this could negatively impact the reputation of this business and
    result in the loss of customers. Such effects could have an
    adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods.



Our
    significant non-US operations expose us to global exchange rate
    fluctuations that could adversely impact our
    profitability.

As we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside
    the United States, fluctuations in currencies of other
    countries, especially the Euro, may materially affect our
    operating results. For example, changes in currency exchange
    rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of
    our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets
    and increase the cost of items required in our operations.

A substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in
    currencies other than the US dollar. In our consolidated
    financial statements, we translate our local currency financial
    results into US dollars based on average exchange rates
    prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the
    end of that period. During times of a strengthening US dollar
    our reported international sales, earnings, assets and
    liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will
    translate into fewer US dollars.

In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency
    transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries
    enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a
    currency different from the operating subsidiary’s
    functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we
    may not be able to manage our currency transaction and
    translation risks effectively, and volatility in currency
    exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of
    operations to a significant additional risk. Since a portion of
    our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other
    than US dollars, a weakening of the US dollar could make it more
    difficult for us to repay our indebtedness.

We use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign
    currency fluctuations, but we cannot guarantee that our hedging
    strategies will be effective. Failure to effectively manage
    these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

Significant
    changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions
    relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the
    valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension
    plans and our pension cost.

The cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of
    time and involve many uncertainties during those periods of
    time. Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan
    assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present
    value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is
    materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension
    obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those
    obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment
    performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets
    can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the
    valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in
    a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. During
    the previous fiscal year, the value of our plan assets declined
    significantly due to the decline in the overall equity markets.
    A change in the discount rate would result in a significant
    increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations,
    affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as
    well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal
    years. In recent years, an extended duration strategy in the
    asset portfolio has been implemented to minimize the influence
    of liability volatility due to interest rate movements.
    Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can
    result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost
    for subsequent fiscal years. If the value of our pension
    fund’s portfolio declines or does not perform as expected
    or if our experience with the fund leads us to change our
    assumptions regarding the fund, we may be required to contribute
    additional capital to the fund.

Our
    future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Our inability to enforce these
    rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position
    and our profit margins.

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    product and process developments in our major markets. Patents
    may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product
    uses. Protection for individual products extends for varying
    periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing
    and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The
    protection afforded, which may also vary from country to
    country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of



coverage. As patents expire, the products and processes
    described and claimed in those patents become generally
    available for use by the public. We also seek to register
    trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names
    of our products, which brand names become more important once
    the corresponding patents have expired. Our continued growth
    strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual
    property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. If
    we are not successful in protecting our trademark or patent
    rights, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows may
    be adversely affected.

Provisions
    in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation
    and second amended and restated bylaws, as well as any
    shareholders’ rights plan, may discourage a takeover
    attempt.

Provisions contained in our second amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more
    difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
    might be beneficial to our shareholders. Provisions of our
    second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which
    could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain
    corporate actions. For example, our second amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors
    to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and
    restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any
    vote or action by our shareholders. Thus, our Board of Directors
    can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or
    conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or
    other rights of holders of our Series A common stock. These
    rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of
    control of our company. In addition, a change of control of our
    company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having
    three classes of directors (each class elected for a three year
    term) or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that
    our Board of Directors may adopt. These provisions could limit
    the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the
    future for shares of our Series A common stock.

Risks
    Related to the Acquisition of Celanese GmbH, formerly Celanese
    AG

The
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss
    transfer agreement (“Domination Agreement”) may be
    increased, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser can
    otherwise make available to us.

Several minority shareholders of Celanese GmbH have initiated
    special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement. On
    March 14, 2005, the Frankfurt District Court dismissed on
    grounds of inadmissibility the motions of all minority
    shareholders regarding the initiation of these special award
    proceedings. In January 2006, the Frankfurt Higher District
    Court ruled that the appeals were admissible, and the
    proceedings will therefore continue. On December 12, 2006,
    the Frankfurt District Court appointed an expert to help
    determine the value of Celanese GmbH. As a result of these
    proceedings, the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of
    the guaranteed annual payment could be increased by the court,
    and the Purchaser would be required to make such payments within
    two months after the publication of the court’s ruling. Any
    such increase may be substantial. All minority shareholders
    would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts. This
    may reduce the funds the Purchaser can make available to us and,
    accordingly, diminish our ability to make payments on our
    indebtedness. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial
    statements for further information.

The
    Purchaser may be required to compensate Celanese GmbH for annual
    losses, which may reduce the funds the Purchaser can otherwise
    make available to us.

Under the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser is required, among
    other things, to compensate Celanese GmbH for any annual loss
    incurred, determined in accordance with German accounting
    requirements, by Celanese GmbH at the end of the fiscal year in
    which the loss was incurred. This obligation to compensate
    Celanese GmbH for annual losses will apply during the entire
    term of the Domination Agreement. If Celanese GmbH incurs losses
    during any period of the operative term of the Domination
    Agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of Celanese
    GmbH at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the
    Domination Agreement, the Purchaser will be obligated to make a
    corresponding cash payment to Celanese GmbH to the extent that
    the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the
    dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of Celanese
    GmbH during the term of the Domination Agreement. The Purchaser
    may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to Celanese GmbH by
    off-setting against such loss compensation claims by Celanese
    GmbH any valuable counterclaims against



Celanese GmbH that the Purchaser may have. If the Purchaser is
    obligated to make cash payments to Celanese GmbH to cover an
    annual loss, we may not have sufficient funds to make payments
    on our indebtedness when due and, unless the Purchaser is able
    to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of
    Celanese GmbH, the Purchaser may not be able to satisfy its
    obligation to fund such shortfall. See Note 23 to the
    consolidated financial statements.

We and
    two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with
    respect to the Purchaser’s obligation under the Domination
    Agreement and intercompany indebtedness to Celanese GmbH, which
    may diminish our ability to make payments on our
    indebtedness.

Our subsidiaries, Celanese International Holdings Luxembourg
    S.à r.l. (“CIH”), formerly Celanese Caylux
    Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A., and Celanese US, have each agreed to
    provide the Purchaser with financing so that the Purchaser is at
    all times in a position to completely meet its obligations
    under, or in connection with, the Domination Agreement. In
    addition, Celanese has guaranteed (i) that the Purchaser
    will meet its obligation under the Domination Agreement to
    compensate Celanese GmbH for any annual loss incurred by
    Celanese GmbH during the term of the Domination Agreement; and
    (ii) the repayment of all existing intercompany
    indebtedness of Celanese’s subsidiaries to Celanese GmbH.
    Further, under the terms of Celanese’s guarantee, in
    certain limited circumstances Celanese GmbH may be entitled to
    require the immediate repayment of some or all of the
    intercompany indebtedness owed by Celanese’s subsidiaries
    to Celanese GmbH. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under their
    obligations to the Purchaser or Celanese GmbH, as the case may
    be, or if the intercompany indebtedness owed to Celanese GmbH is
    accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds for payments on
    our indebtedness when due.

Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness

See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    Liquidity — Contractual Obligations.”

Our
    level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise
    additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to
    react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and
    prevent us from meeting obligations under our
    indebtedness.

Our total indebtedness is approximately $3.5 billion as of
    December 31, 2008.

Our debt could have important consequences, including:

•

increasing vulnerability to general economic and industry
    conditions including exacerbating any adverse business effects
    that are determined to be material adverse effects under our
    senior credit facility;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service
    requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other
    purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who have less debt.

A breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument
    governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a
    default under that instrument and, due to cross-default
    provisions, could result in a default under our senior credit
    facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the
    senior credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all
    amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and
    terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were
    unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against
    the collateral, if any, granted to them to secure the
    indebtedness. If the lenders under the senior credit facility
    were to accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, there is no
    guarantee that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to
    repay in full our outstanding indebtedness.



Moreover, the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit
    us or our subsidiaries from incurring substantial additional
    indebtedness in the future. If new debt, including amounts
    available under our senior credit agreement, is added to our
    current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could
    intensify. See also “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Liquidity — Contractual
    Obligations.”

Our
    variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk,
    which could cause our debt service obligations to increase
    significantly and affect our operating results.

Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and
    expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to
    increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate
    indebtedness would increase, net of the impacts of hedges in
    place. In April 2007, we, through certain of our
    subsidiaries, entered into a senior credit agreement. The new
    senior credit agreement consists of $2,280 million of US
    dollar denominated and €400 million of Euro
    denominated term loans due 2014, a $650 million revolving
    credit facility terminating in 2013 and a $228 million
    credit-linked revolving facility terminating in 2014. Borrowings
    under the new senior credit agreement bear interest at a
    variable interest rate based on LIBOR (for US dollars) or
    EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable, or, for US dollar
    denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in
    each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for
    the term loans and any loans under the credit-linked revolving
    facility is 1.75%, subject to potential reductions as defined in
    the new senior credit agreement. The term loans under the new
    senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the
    initial principal amount per annum, payable quarterly,
    commencing in July 2007. The remaining principal amount of the
    term loans will be due on April 2, 2014.

An increase in interest rates could have an adverse impact on
    our future results of operations and cash flows. See also
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk — Interest Rate Risk Management.”

We may
    not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our
    indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy
    obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be
    successful.

Our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand,
    receipt of additional capital, including possible additional
    borrowings, and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of
    distributions, advances or cash payments.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on the financial condition and
    operating performance of our subsidiaries, which is subject to
    prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain
    financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may
    not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
    activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
    premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or
    delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital
    or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such
    operating results and resources, we could face substantial
    liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material
    assets or operations to meet our debt service and other
    obligations. The senior credit agreement governing our
    indebtedness restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use
    the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to
    consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we
    could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate
    to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Restrictive
    covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to
    engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to
    make payments on our indebtedness.

The senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains
    various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified
    types of transactions. The covenants contained in the senior
    credit agreement limit our ability to, among other things, incur
    additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other
    distributions on or repurchase capital stock or make other
    restricted payments, make investments and sell certain assets.
    Such restrictions in our debt instruments could result in us
    having to obtain the consent of our lenders in order to take
    certain actions. Recent disruptions in credit markets may
    prevent us from or make it more difficult or more costly for us
    to obtain such



consents from our lenders. Our ability to expand our business or
    to address declines in our business may be limited if we are
    unable to obtain such consents.

In addition, the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain
    a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio no greater
    than 3.90 to 1.00 if there are outstanding borrowings under the
    revolving credit facility. Our ability to meet this financial
    ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may
    not be able to meet this test at all.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default
    under the senior credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an
    event of default under the senior credit agreement, the lenders
    could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior
    credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate
    all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to
    repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior credit
    agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them
    to secure that indebtedness. Our subsidiaries have pledged a
    significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior
    credit agreement. If the lenders under the senior credit
    agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not
    have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the
    senior credit agreement as well as their other indebtedness,
    which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our
    stock.

The
    terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of BCP
    Crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise
    transfer their assets to us.

Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our
    ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the
    distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, the terms
    of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of BCP Crystal
    and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer
    their assets to us. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on
    our stock is similarly limited.

    with certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims, we believe, based on the advice of legal
    counsel, that adequate provisions have been made and that the
    ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, but may have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting
    period. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial

Holders

No shares of Celanese’s Series B common stock are
    issued and outstanding. As of February 6, 2009, there were
    72 holders of record of our Series A common stock, and one
    holder of record of our perpetual preferred stock. By including
    persons holding shares in broker accounts under street names,
    however, we estimate our shareholder base to be approximately
    56,000 as of February 6, 2009.

Dividend
    Policy

Our Board of Directors adopted a policy of declaring, subject to
    legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share
    of our Series A common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per
    share unless our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion,
    determines otherwise. Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly
    dividends of $0.04 per share on February 1, 2008,
    May 1, 2008, August 1, 2008 and November 1, 2008
    and similar quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2007. The
    annual cash dividend declared and paid during the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $24 million and
    $25 million, respectively. Dividends payable to holders of
    our Series A common stock cannot be declared or paid nor
    can any funds be set aside for the payment thereof, unless we
    have paid or set aside funds for the payment of all accumulated
    and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of our preferred
    stock, as described below. Our Board of Directors may, at any
    time, modify or revoke our dividend policy on our Series A
    common stock.

We are required under the terms of the preferred stock to pay
    scheduled quarterly dividends, subject to legally available
    funds. For so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding,
    (1) we will not declare, pay or set apart funds for the
    payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to
    any junior stock or parity stock and (2) neither we, nor
    any of our subsidiaries, will, subject to certain exceptions,
    redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration junior
    stock or parity stock through a sinking fund or otherwise, in
    each case unless we have paid or set apart funds for the payment
    of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the
    shares of preferred stock and any parity stock for all preceding
    dividend periods. Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly
    dividends of $0.265625 per share on our 4.25% convertible
    perpetual preferred stock on February 1, 2008, May 1,
    2008, August 1, 2008 and November 1, 2008 and similar
    quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2007.



On January 5, 2009, we declared a cash dividend of
    $0.265625 per share on our 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred
    stock amounting to $3 million and a cash dividend of $0.04
    per share on its Series A common stock amounting to
    $6 million. Both cash dividends are for the period
    November 1, 2008 to January 31, 2009 and were paid on
    February 1, 2009 to holders of record as of
    January 15, 2009.

Based on the number of outstanding shares as of
    December 31, 2008, the cash dividends to be paid in 2009
    are expected to result in annual dividend payments similar to
    that paid in 2008.

The amount available to us to pay cash dividends is restricted
    by our senior credit agreement. Any decision to declare and pay
    dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our
    Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our
    results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition,
    contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of
    Directors may deem relevant.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities

In December 2007, we adopted a deferred compensation plan
    whereby we offered certain of our senior employees and directors
    the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation in
    exchange for a future payment amount equal to their deferments
    plus or minus certain amounts based upon the market-performance
    of specified measurement funds selected by the participant.
    These deferred compensation obligations may be considered
    securities of Celanese. Participants were required to make
    deferral elections under the plan prior to January 1 of the
    year such deferrals will be withheld from their compensation. We
    relied on the exemption from registration provided by
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act in making this offer to
    a select group of employees, fewer than 35 of which were
    non-accredited investors under the rules promulgated by the
    Commission.

Item 6.

Selected
    Financial Data

The balance sheet data shown below as of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the statements of operations and cash flow data
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, all
    of which are set forth below, are derived from the consolidated

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

In this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the term “Celanese” refers to Celanese Corporation, a
    Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the
    “Company,” “we,” “our” and
    “us” refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a
    consolidated basis. The term “Celanese US” refers to
    our subsidiary Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
    liability company, formally known as BCP Crystal US Holdings
    Corp., a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The
    term “Purchaser” refers to our subsidiary, Celanese
    Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known as BCP
    Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG, a German limited
    partnership, and not its subsidiaries, except where otherwise
    indicated.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of the
    financial condition and the results of operations together with
    the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes
    to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“US GAAP”).

Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements
    contained in this section involve both risk and uncertainty.
    Several important factors could cause actual results to differ
    materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of
    these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore,
    beyond the control of management. See “Forward-Looking
    Statements May Prove Inaccurate” below.

Reconciliation of Non-US GAAP Measures:  We
    believe that using non-US GAAP financial measures to supplement
    US GAAP results is useful to investors because such use provides
    a more complete understanding of the factors and trends
    affecting the business other than disclosing US GAAP results
    alone. In this regard, we disclose net debt, which is a non-US
    GAAP financial measure. Net debt is defined as total debt less
    cash and cash equivalents. We use net debt to evaluate the
    capital structure. Net debt is not a substitute for any US GAAP
    financial measure. In addition, calculations of net debt
    contained in this report may not be consistent with that of
    other companies. The most directly comparable financial measure
    presented in accordance with US GAAP in our financial statements
    for net debt is total debt. For a reconciliation of net debt to
    total debt, see “Financial Highlights” below.

Forward-Looking
    Statements May Prove Inaccurate

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and other
    parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking
    statements and information relating to us that are based on the
    beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and
    information currently available to, us. When used in this
    document, words such as “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “plan” and “project” and
    similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to
    identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect
    our current views with respect to future events, are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
    uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Further, certain
    forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to
    future events that may not prove to be accurate. We assume no
    obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements
    for any reason, except as required by law.

See the Risk Factors section under Part 1, Item 1A for
    a description of risk factors that could significantly affect
    our financial results. In addition, the following factors could
    cause our actual results to differ materially from those
    results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors
    include, among other things:

•

changes in general economic, business, political and regulatory
    conditions in the countries or regions in which we operate;

•

the length and depth of product and industry business cycles
    particularly in the automotive, electrical, electronics and
    construction industries;

•

changes in the price and availability of raw materials,
    particularly changes in the demand for, supply of, and market
    prices of ethylene, methanol, natural gas, wood pulp, fuel oil
    and electricity;

•

the ability to pass increases in raw material prices on to
    customers or otherwise improve margins through price increases;



•

the ability to maintain plant utilization rates and to implement
    planned capacity additions and expansions;

•

the ability to reduce production costs and improve productivity
    by implementing technological improvements to existing plants;

•

increased price competition and the introduction of competing
    products by other companies;

•

changes in the degree of intellectual property and other legal
    protection afforded to our products;

•

compliance costs and potential disruption or interruption of
    production due to accidents or other unforeseen events or delays
    in construction of facilities;

•

potential liability for remedial actions under existing or
    future environmental regulations;

•

potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation,
    or from changes in the laws, regulations or policies of
    governments or other governmental activities in the countries in
    which we operate;

•

changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates; and

•

various other factors, both referenced and not referenced in
    this document.

Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are,
    therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks
    or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions
    prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements
    may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report
    as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned
    or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to
    update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
    their dates.

Overview

During 2008, we made significant strides in strengthening our
    competitive position. As detailed below, we advanced our
    expansion efforts in Asia, successfully generated cash and used
    it to deliver value for our shareholders, settled legacy
    litigation matters, carried out our sustainability commitments
    and fulfilled our role as a responsible corporate citizen.

2008 Highlights:

•

Opened a customer application development center in Shanghai,
    China, to support growth in the region for Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ engineering polymers business.

•

Our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to
    $500 million of our Series A common stock. During the
    year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased
    9,763,200 shares of our Series A common stock for
    $378 million pursuant to this authorization.

•

Signed an agreement to establish a 20,000 square-meter
    integrated technology and marketing facility in Shanghai, China.
    The facility will combine the headquarters for our Asia
    businesses, customer application development and research and
    development center.

•

Successfully started up our newly constructed 20,000 ton
    ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene
    (“GUR

®

”)

    facility, 100,000 ton acetic anhydride facility and 300,000 ton
    vinyl acetate monomer (“VAM”) facility, all located at
    our integrated chemical complex in Nanjing, China.

•

Our Nutrinova business and BRAIN AG, a leading European
    “white” biotech company, identified all-natural
    compounds for high intensity sweeteners and sweetness enhancers.

•

Introduced
    EcoVAE

tm

,

    a new vinyl acetate/ethylene emulsion technology designed to
    facilitate the manufacture of high quality, eco-friendly paints
    for North America and Asia.

•

Resolved certain legacy litigation matters by entering into a
    settlement agreement for $107 million related to sales by
    the polyester staple fibers business, which Hoechst AG sold to
    KoSa, Inc. in 1998. In addition, we paid €17 million
    to settle Sorbates antitrust actions with the European
    Commission.



•

Announced plans to build a new
    Vectra

®

liquid crystal polymer (“LCP”) production facility
    co-located at our integrated chemical complex in Nanjing, China.
    Construction for the LCP production facility and start-up dates
    will depend on market conditions.

•

Began construction of the world’s largest polyacetal plant
    in Hoechst Industrial Park. The state-of-the-art facility is
    expected to be operational in 2011 and will replace
    Ticona’s existing production operations in Kelsterbach,
    Germany.

•

Received Green Partner certification from Sony Corporation at
    our Ticona plant in Shelby, North Carolina. The certification
    recognizes suppliers’ cooperation of eco-friendly products
    and their ability to meet established regulations for
    environment-related substances found in components of products
    that bear the Sony name.

•

Announced the shutdown of the VAM production unit in Cangrejera,
    Mexico and the assessment of the potential closure of acetic
    acid and vinyl acetate monomer (“VAM”) production in
    Pardies, France and certain other actions.

•

Released our 2008 Sustainability Report, which details our
    industry-leading commitment to safety, health and the
    environment across our worldwide operations. The report also
    highlights best practices driven by our employees around the
    world.

•

Reached an agreement with the Frankfurt, Germany Airport to
    receive an advance payment of €322 million associated
    with the relocation of our Ticona business in Kelsterbach,
    Germany. This advance payment will be in lieu of payments of
    €200 million and €140 million originally
    scheduled to be paid in June 2009 and June 2010, respectively.

During the first half of 2008, the US and Europe began to
    experience challenging economic conditions that resulted in
    significant inflation in raw material and energy pricing.
    Despite the challenges, we were able to implement higher pricing
    on continued strong demand and higher volumes associated with
    our growth strategy in Asia, all of which contributed to growth
    in net sales during the period.

During the second half of 2008, recessionary trends stemming
    from the US credit crisis quickly spread to other regions
    of the world. This triggered an unexpected reduction in consumer
    and industrial demand that caused our customers to sharply lower
    their inventories during the last few months of the year. As a
    result, demand for our products declined dramatically and we
    aggressively managed our global production capacity to align
    with the current environment. During this period of economic
    uncertainty, we remained focused on executing our long-term
    strategy to increase the value of Celanese.

    Outlook

We expect inventory destocking to diminish in 2009, but do not
    foresee a short-term recovery in the global economic
    environment. We expect earnings to improve from fourth quarter
    levels throughout the year as the impact of destocking and the
    negative effects of lower-of-cost or market and first-in,
    first-out inventory accounting decrease.

We are taking aggressive actions in response to the expected
    prolonged weak demand environment. These actions include an
    assessment of our current manufacturing footprint and reductions
    of our overall fixed cost structure. Initial fixed cost
    reductions have been initiated and are estimated to result in
    between $100 million and $120 million of cost savings
    annually.

Expansion
    in China

The Nanjing complex brings world-class scale to one site for the
    production of acetic acid, VAM, acetic anhydride, emulsions,
    Celstran

®

long fiber reinforced thermoplastic (“LFRT”),
    GUR

®

,

    Vectra

®

LCP and compounding. We believe the Nanjing complex will further
    enhance our capabilities to better meet the growing needs of our
    customers in a number of industries across Asia.

The acetic acid facility located in our Nanjing, China complex
    achieved normal operations in June 2007 and we commenced
    production of vinyl acetate emulsions at the complex during the
    fourth quarter of 2007. During the



first quarter of 2008, we commissioned the startup of our LFRT
    unit in Nanjing. Our newly constructed 20,000 ton
    GUR

®

facility, 100,000 ton acetic anhydride facility and 300,000 ton
    VAM facility started up during the third quarter of 2008.
    Operations for the compounding plant at the complex are expected
    to begin during 2009.

In 2008, we announced our plans to build an LCP production
    facility at our Nanjing complex. Construction for the LCP
    production facility and start-up dates will depend on market
    conditions.

Summary
    of Consolidated Results — Year Ended December 31,
    2008 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007

The challenging economic environment in the United States and
    Europe during the first half of 2008 resulted in higher raw
    material and energy costs which enabled price increase
    initiatives across all segments. During the second half of 2008,
    the US credit crisis accelerated the economic slowdown and its
    spread to other regions of the world. Despite the halt in
    demand, we were able to maintain the majority of our enacted
    price increases through the



remainder of 2008. As a result, increased prices improved net
    sales by 8%. Favorable foreign currency impacts also had a
    positive impact on net sales of 3%.

Net sales declined 5% due to decreased volumes. Lower volumes
    were primarily a result of decreased demand stemming from the
    global economic downturn. As demand declined, particularly
    during the fourth quarter of 2008, our customers began
    destocking to reduce their inventory levels. In response, we
    aggressively managed our global production capacity to align
    with the current environment. We expect destocking trends to
    continue to a lesser extent into the first quarter of 2009.
    Decreased volumes in our acetate flake and tow businesses were
    not significantly impacted by the economic downturn. Rather,
    decreased flake volumes were the result of our strategic
    decision to shift our flake production to our China ventures,
    which we account for as cost investments. The full impact of
    this shift has been realized during 2008 and thus the resulting
    trend of diminishing volumes is not expected to continue.

Gross profit declined as higher raw material, energy and freight
    costs more than offset increases in net sales during the period.
    The uncertain economic environment resulted in higher natural
    gas, ethylene, methanol and other commodity prices during the
    first nine months of the year. Our freight costs also increased,
    primarily due to increased rates driven by higher energy prices.
    Late in 2008, raw material and energy prices declined and we
    expect that decline to positively impact gross profit during the
    first quarter of 2009.

Other charges increased in 2008 compared to 2007 and includes a
    long-lived asset impairment loss of $92 million in
    connection with the potential closure of our acetic acid and VAM
    production facility in Pardies, France, our VAM production unit
    in Cangrejera, Mexico and certain other facilities.
    Consideration of this potential capacity reduction was
    necessitated by the significant change in the global economic
    environment and anticipated lower customer demand. Following the
    initial assessment of this capacity reduction, we determined we
    would shut down the Cangrejera VAM production unit effective at
    the end of February 2009.

In addition, we recognized $23 million of long-lived asset
    impairment losses and $13 million of employee termination
    benefits in 2008 related to the shutdown of our Pampa, Texas
    facility.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
    $24 million during 2008 primarily due to business
    optimization and finance improvement initiatives.

Operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher
    other charges and selling, general and administrative costs. The
    absence of a $34 million gain on the sale of our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility during 2007 also contributed to lower
    operating profit in 2008 as compared to 2007.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased $28 million
    during 2008, primarily due to reduced earnings from our Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ affiliates resulting from higher raw
    material and energy costs and decreased demand.



Our effective income tax rate for 2008 was 15% compared to 25%
    in 2007. The effective income tax rate decreased in 2008 due to:
    1) a decrease in the valuation allowance 2) tax credits
    generated on foreign jurisdictions and 3) the US tax impact of
    foreign operations.

The loss from discontinued operations of $90 million during
    2008 primarily relates to a legal settlement agreement we
    entered into during 2008. Under the settlement agreement, we
    agreed to pay $107 million to resolve certain legacy items.
    Because the legal proceeding related to sales by the polyester
    staple fibers business which Hoechst AG sold to KoSa, Inc. in
    1998, the impact of the settlement is reflected within
    discontinued operations in the current period. See the
    “Polyester Staple Antitrust Litigation” section in
    Note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.

Summary
    of Consolidated Results — Year Ended December 31,
    2007 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net sales increased
    by 12% to $6,444 million compared to the same period in
    2006 as increases in pricing and favorable currency impacts more
    than offset lower overall volumes. Overall pricing contributed
    to a 6% increase in net sales primarily due to a tight global
    supply of acetyl, PVOH and emulsion products, and higher acetate
    tow and flake prices. Favorable currency impacts (particularly
    related to the Euro) also contributed to a 4% increase in net
    sales and the acquisition of Acetate Products Limited
    (“APL”) in 2007 increased net sales by
    $227 million. Strong volume increases due to increased
    market penetration from several of Advanced Engineered
    Material’s key products and the successful startup of our
    acetic acid unit in Nanjing, China helped to partially offset
    the decreases in volumes in our Acetyl Intermediates and
    Industrial Specialties segments resulting from the temporary
    unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake,
    Texas facility.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained relatively
    flat for the year ended December 31, 2007 (22.4%) compared
    to the same period in 2006 (22.7%). The slight decrease was
    primarily due to lower overall volumes and higher energy and raw
    material costs more than offsetting the higher overall prices
    and favorable currency impacts (particularly related to the
    Euro).

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by
    $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease was primarily
    due to the absence of executive severance and legal costs
    associated with the Squeeze-Out of $23 million and
    long-term incentive plan expenses of $20 million, both
    recorded in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses
    also decreased $5 million due to lower

stock-based

compensation expenses during the year ended December 31,
    2007. The decreases were partially offset by $15 million of
    additional expenses related to finance improvement initiatives
    and $6 million related to the revised deferred compensation
    plan expenses.

Other (charges) gains, net increased $48 million during
    2007 as compared to 2006:

Other charges for employee termination benefits and plant/office
    closures include charges related to: 1) our plan to
    simplify and optimize our Emulsions and PVOH businesses to
    become a leader in technology and innovation and grow in both
    new and existing markets and 2) charges related to the sale
    of our Pampa, Texas facility. Additionally, we recorded a
    $74 million deferred compensation charge in May 2007 as a
    result of the triggering of an Exit Event, as defined in
    Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Also
    included in other charges are $40 million in insurance
    recoveries we received during the fourth quarter of 2007 in
    partial satisfaction of claims that we made based on losses
    resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid
    unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. In addition, during the
    fourth quarter of 2007, we received $31 million as a
    one-time payment in resolution of commercial disputes with a
    vendor.

The net $128 million improvement in operating profit during
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006 is a
    result of higher net sales, lower selling, general and
    administrative expenses and a $34 million gain recorded on
    the sale of our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada facility during 2007,
    offset by higher other charges, as discussed above.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 8% in the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006
    due primarily to improved performance from our InfraServ
    affiliates.

Interest expense decreased $31 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The
    decrease was primarily related to lower interest rates on the
    new senior credit agreement compared to the interest rates on
    the senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes, which
    were repaid in April 2007 in conjunction with the debt
    refinancing (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements for more information). These decreases were partially
    offset by an increase in interest expense due to additional
    China financing activities in 2007.

Refinancing expenses incurred during 2007 related to our debt
    refinancing. As a result of the refinancing, we expensed
    $207 million of premiums paid on early redemption of debt.
    In addition, we expensed $33 million of unamortized
    deferred financing costs and premiums related to the former
    $2,454 million senior credit facility, senior discount
    notes and senior subordinated notes and $16 million of debt
    issuance and other refinancing expenses.

Income tax expense decreased by $93 million to
    $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was 25%, which is less than the combined
    US federal and state statutory rate of 39%. The effective tax
    rate for 2007 was favorably impacted by (1) an increase in
    unrepatriated low-taxed earnings including tax holidays and
    (2) the tax benefit related to German Tax Reform of
    $39 million recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. These benefits are partially offset by
    the accounting treatment of recent tax law changes in Mexico.
    See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

Earnings from discontinued operations primarily relate to Acetyl
    Intermediates’ sale of its oxo products and derivatives
    businesses in February 2007, the shut down of its Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada methanol operations during the second quarter of
    2007 and its pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations, which
    were discontinued during the third quarter of 2006. As a result,
    revenues and expenses related to these businesses and operations
    are reflected as a component of discontinued operations.

Our Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical
    polymers for application in automotive and electronics products,
    as well as other consumer and industrial applications. Together
    with our strategic affiliates, we are a leading participant in
    the global technical polymers industry. The primary products of
    Advanced Engineered Materials are POM, PPS, LFRT, PBT, PET,



GUR

®

and LCP. POM, PPS, LFRT, PBT and PET are used in a broad range
    of products including automotive components, electronics,
    appliances and industrial applications.
    GUR

®

is used in battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration
    equipment, coatings and medical devices. Primary end markets for
    LCP are electrical and electronics.

Net sales increased 3% during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily
    as a result of implemented pricing increases combined with
    favorable foreign currency impacts. Increases in net sales were
    partially offset by lower volumes due to significant weakness in
    the US and European automotive and housing industries. Extended
    plant shutdowns enacted by major car manufacturers during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 contributed significantly to the volume
    decline.

Operating profit declined $101 million primarily due to
    higher raw material, freight and energy costs. Raw material
    costs increased on higher prices while freight costs increased
    as a result of increased freight rates and larger shipments to
    Asia. Raw material costs declined late in 2008 and we expect to
    realize a benefit from the lower prices early in 2009 as our
    higher-cost inventory levels diminish. Higher depreciation and
    amortization expense and increased other charges also
    contributed to lower operating profit. Depreciation and
    amortization expense are higher in 2008 due to the

start-up

of
    the
    GUR

®

and LFRT units in Asia. Other charges consist primarily of a
    $16 million long-lived asset impairment loss related to the
    potential closure of certain Advanced Engineered Materials’
    facilities and $12 million related to the relocation of our
    Ticona plant in Kelsterbach. See “Ticona Kelsterbach Plant
    Relocation” below.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests decreased due to decreased operating profit and
    decreased equity in net earnings of affiliates. Equity in net
    earnings of affiliates decreased $18 million during 2008,
    primarily due to reduced earnings from our Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ affiliates resulting from higher raw material
    and energy costs and decreased demand.

Ticona
    Kelsterbach Plant Relocation

In 2007, we finalized a settlement agreement with the Frankfurt,
    Germany Airport (“Fraport”) to relocate our
    Kelsterbach, Germany, business, resolving several years of legal
    disputes related to the planned Frankfurt airport expansion. As
    a result of the settlement, we will transition Ticona’s
    operations from Kelsterbach to the Hoechst Industrial Park in
    the Rhine Main area by mid-2011. Over a five-year period,
    Fraport will pay Ticona a total of €670 million to
    offset the costs associated with the transition of the business
    from its current location and the closure of the Kelsterbach
    plant. In June 2008, we received €200 million
    ($311 million) from Fraport under this agreement. Amounts
    received from Fraport are accounted for as deferred proceeds and
    are included in noncurrent other liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

In February 2009, we announced the Fraport supervisory board
    approved the acceleration of the 2009 and 2010 payments of
    €200 million and €140 million, respectively,
    required by the settlement agreement signed in June 2007. On
    February 5, 2009, we received a discounted amount of
    approximately €322 million, excluding value-added tax
    of €59 million.

Our Consumer Specialties segment consists of our Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. Our Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow, which is used in
    the production of filter products. We also produce acetate flake
    which is processed into acetate fiber in the form of a tow band.
    Our Nutrinova business produces and sells
    Sunett

®

,

    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceuticals
    industries.

Net sales increased 4% to $1,155 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2008 driven primarily by pricing actions
    in our Acetate Products business and an additional month of
    sales from our Acetate Products Limited (“APL”)
    acquisition, which was acquired on January 31, 2007, offset
    by lower volumes. Lower volumes are a direct result of our
    strategic decision to shift acetate flake production to our
    China ventures, which are accounted for as cost method
    investments. The full impact of this shift has been realized
    during 2008 and thus the resulting trend of diminishing volumes
    is not expected to continue. Lower flake volumes were partially
    offset by a 5% increase in tow volumes as we were able to
    capture a portion of the growth in global tow demand.

The increase in net sales due to higher sales prices during 2008
    was offset most significantly by higher energy costs, and to a
    lesser extent, higher raw material and freight costs. Operating
    profit, as compared to 2007, declined primarily due to the
    absence of a $22 million gain on the sale of our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility in 2007. Other charges during 2007
    includes $3 million of deferred compensation plan expenses
    and $5 million of other restructuring charges, offset by
    insurance recoveries of $5 million for partial satisfaction
    of the business interruption losses resulting from the temporary
    unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake,
    Texas facility.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests of $237 million increased from 2007 as increased
    dividends from our China ventures more than offset the decline
    in operating profit. Increased dividends are the result of
    increased volumes and higher prices, as well as efficiency
    improvements.

Our Industrial Specialties segment includes our Emulsions, PVOH
    and AT Plastics businesses. Our Emulsions business is a global
    leader which produces a broad product portfolio, specializing in
    vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions, and is a recognized authority
    on low VOC (volatile organic compounds), an
    environmentally-friendly technology. As a global leader, our
    PVOH business produces a broad portfolio of performance PVOH
    chemicals engineered to meet specific customer requirements. Our
    emulsions and PVOH products are used in a wide array of
    applications including paints and coatings, adhesives, building
    and construction, glass fiber, textiles and paper. AT Plastics
    offers a complete line of low-density polyethylene and specialty
    ethylene vinyl acetate resins and compounds. AT Plastics’
    products are used in many applications including flexible
    packaging films, lamination film products, hot melt adhesives,
    medical tubing, automotive carpeting and solar cell
    encapsulation films.

Net sales increased by 4% during 2008 as increased prices and
    favorable foreign currency impacts more than offset volume
    reductions. Pricing actions implemented by all business lines
    late in 2007 and during 2008 contributed to the increase in net
    sales. Volumes declined primarily on decreased demand across all
    regions due to the global economic downturn combined with the
    temporary shutdown of our AT Plastics plant late in 2008. The
    overall volume decline was partially offset by increased
    emulsions volumes at our Nanjing, China facility, which began
    operating late in 2008.

Increased net sales were more than offset by higher raw material
    and energy costs during 2008. The $19 million increase in
    operating profit was primarily due to lower other charges and
    the absence of the $7 million loss on the divestiture of
    our AT Plastics’ Films business in 2007. During 2007, we
    initiated a plan to simplify and optimize our Emulsions and PVOH
    businesses to focus on technology and innovation. Other charges
    during 2008 includes a charge of $3 million for employee
    termination benefits and accelerated depreciation related to
    this plan. Other charges during 2007 includes a charge of
    $14 million for employee termination benefits,
    $3 million for an impairment of long-lived assets and
    $5 million of accelerated depreciation expense for our
    shuttered United Kingdom plant related to this plan. Other
    charges in 2007 also include $6 million of goodwill
    impairment and receipt of $7 million in insurance
    recoveries in partial satisfaction of the business interruption
    losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the
    acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility.

Our Acetyl Intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl
    products, including acetic acid, VAM, acetic anhydride and
    acetate esters. These products are generally used as starting
    materials for colorants, paints, adhesives, coatings, medicines
    and more. Other chemicals produced in this segment are organic
    solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical, agricultural and
    chemical products.

Net sales increased by 7% during 2008 primarily due to increased
    prices and favorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset
    by lower volumes. Our formula-based pricing arrangements
    benefited from higher ethylene and methanol costs during the
    first nine months of 2008. Market tightness in the Americas and
    favorable foreign currency impacts in Europe also contributed to
    the increase in net sales. Reduced volumes offset the increase
    in net sales as the slowdown of the global economy caused
    customers to slow production and diminish current inventory
    levels, particularly in Asia during the fourth quarter. We
    expect the impact of our customers’ destocking initiatives
    to continue to a lesser extent during 2009. Ethylene and
    methanol prices decreased during the fourth quarter of 2008 on
    slowed global demand.

Operating profit declined $307 million primarily as a
    result of higher ethylene, methanol and energy prices, increased
    other charges, increased depreciation and amortization and the
    absence of a $12 million gain on the sale of our Edmonton
    facility in 2007. Other charges increased during 2008 partially
    due to $76 million of long-lived asset impairment losses
    recognized in 2008 related to the potential closure of our
    acetic acid and VAM production facility in Pardies, France, our
    VAM production unit in Cangrejera, Mexico (which we subsequently
    decided to shut down effective at the end of February 2009) and
    certain other facilities. Other charges in 2008 also includes
    $23 million of long-lived asset impairment and
    $13 million of severance and retention charges related to
    the shutdown of our Pampa, Texas facility. Also contributing to
    the increase was the absence of a one-time payment of
    $31 million received in 2007 in resolution of commercial
    disputes with a vendor and a $25 million decrease in
    insurance recoveries received in partial satisfaction of the
    losses resulting from the temporary outage of the acetic acid
    unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. Increased depreciation
    and amortization expense during 2008 is the result of
    accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of our
    Pampa, Texas facility and a full year of depreciation for our
    acetic acid plant in Nanjing, China, which started up in
    mid-2007.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interest differs from operating profit primarily as a result of
    dividend income from our cost investment, National Methanol Co.
    (“Ibn Sina”). Increased dividend income of
    $41 million during 2008 had a positive impact on earnings
    from continuing operations before tax and minority interest. Ibn
    Sina increased their dividends as a result of higher earnings
    from expanding margins for methanol and methyl tertiary-butyl
    ether.



Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including finance and administrative activities, and our captive
    insurance companies.

Net sales remained flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. We do not
    expect third-party revenues from our captive insurance companies
    to increase significantly in the near future.

The operating loss for Other Activities improved
    $90 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due to lower
    other charges, partially offset by higher selling, general and
    administrative expenses. Other charges decreased principally due
    to the release of reserves related to the Sorbates antitrust
    actions settlement of $8 million and the absence of
    $59 million of deferred compensation plan costs which were
    incurred during 2007. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased due to additional spending on business
    optimization and finance improvement initiatives during 2008.

The loss from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests decreased $346 million during 2008. The
    significant decrease was primarily due to the absence of
    $256 million of refinancing costs incurred in 2007 and the
    decrease in the operating loss discussed above.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ net sales increased 13% for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006 primarily due to volume growth in all major
    business lines and favorable currency impacts partially offset
    by a slight decline in pricing. Overall volume for the year
    increased, principally driven by increased market penetration,
    successful implementation of new projects and a continued strong
    business environment, particularly in Europe. Advanced
    Engineered Materials experienced a slight decline in average
    pricing primarily driven by a larger mix of sales from lower
    priced products.

Operating profit decreased to $133 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to $145 million for
    the same period in 2006 as higher volumes and favorable currency
    impacts were more than offset by higher energy costs, increased
    other charges and slightly lower average pricing. Other charges
    increased primarily due to $2 million of deferred
    compensation plan expenses and $5 million of Kelsterbach
    plant relocation costs, both incurred in 2007.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests decreased 6% to $189 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006
    primarily due to lower operating profits in 2007 driven by
    increased other charges as discussed above.

Consumer Specialties’ net sales increased 27% for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006
    primarily driven by additional net sales from the APL
    acquisition completed on January 31, 2007. Net sales for
    APL were $227 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Higher pricing for acetate tow and flake
    products, higher
    Sunett

®

sweetener volumes and favorable currency impacts for the
    Nutrinova business also contributed to the overall increase in
    net sales. Higher
    Sunett

®

sweetener volumes reflected the continued growth in the global
    beverage and confectionary markets. These increases were
    partially offset by lower acetate flake volumes and
    Nutrinova’s exit of non-core lower margin trade business
    during the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in acetate flake
    volumes was due primarily to the shift in production of acetate
    flake to our China ventures.

Operating profit increased $34 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006.
    Higher overall pricing more than offset increases in raw
    material costs. Higher overall costs were primarily due to price
    increases in wood pulp, acetyls (used as raw materials in
    acetate flake production) and acetate flake as well as expenses
    associated with the continued integration of APL. Other charges
    during the year ended December 31, 2007 includes
    $3 million of deferred compensation plan expenses,
    $5 million of other restructuring charges and insurance
    recoveries of $5 million for partial satisfaction of the
    losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the
    acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. Also
    included in operating profit for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 is a $22 million gain related to the
    sale of our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada facility.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased $50 million to $235 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. The increase was driven principally by the
    changes in operating profit discussed above and an increase of
    $16 million in dividends received from our China ventures
    during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the
    same period in 2006.

Depreciation and amortization increased $12 million to
    $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006 primarily driven by the

Industrial Specialties’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 increased 5% to $1,346 million
    compared to the same period in 2006 primarily driven by pricing
    increases and favorable currency impacts partially offset by a
    slight decrease in volumes. Higher overall pricing, particularly
    in our emulsions and PVOH products, was primarily due to market
    tightness and increasing raw material costs which allowed for
    upward movement in pricing across all regions. Lower volumes
    were primarily driven by the tight supply of VAM, a major raw
    material used in the production of emulsions products. This was
    a result of the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid
    unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility and other global planned
    and unplanned production outages in the chemical industry during
    the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales
    was partially offset by the absence of net sales from the AT
    Plastics’ Films business, which was divested during the
    third quarter of 2007.

Operating profit decreased $16 million to $28 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. Higher prices and favorable currency impacts
    were more than offset by the increase in other charges. Other
    charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 included
    $14 million of employee termination benefits,
    $3 million for an impairment of long-lived assets and
    $5 million of accelerated depreciation expense for our
    shuttered United Kingdom plant. These increases were a result of
    our plan to simplify and optimize our Emulsions and PVOH
    businesses to become a leader in technology and innovation and
    grow in both new and existing markets. Other charges for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 also included $6 million
    of goodwill impairment. The increase in other charges was
    partially offset by insurance recoveries of $7 million for
    partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the temporary
    unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake,
    Texas facility. Additionally, operating profit decreased by
    $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 as
    a result of the loss on the divestiture of our AT Plastics’
    Films business.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests decreased $15 million to $28 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in
    2006 principally driven by lower operating profits.

Acetyl Intermediates’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 increased 8% to $3,615 million
    compared to the same period in 2006 driven by pricing increases
    and favorable currency impacts partially offset by lower
    volumes. Tight supply of acetyl products caused by global
    planned and unplanned production outages in the industry and
    higher methanol and ethylene prices were the drivers of the
    price increases. Lower volumes in 2007 were the result of lower
    product availability due to the temporary unplanned outage of
    the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. However,
    the decrease in volumes from the Clear Lake, Texas facility was
    partially offset by the successful startup of our acetic acid
    plant in Nanjing, China and externally procured product.

Operating profit increased to $616 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to $456 million in
    the same period in 2006. Higher pricing, favorable currency
    impacts and an improvement in other charges were partially
    offset by higher raw material costs. Other charges for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 included $4 million of
    employee termination benefits and $5 million of expenses
    related to accelerated depreciation expense, both associated
    with the shutdown of our Pampa, Texas plant, and
    $10 million for deferred compensation plan expenses. These
    charges were more than offset by $31 million related to a
    one-time payment received in resolution of commercial disputes
    with a vendor and insurance recoveries of $28 million for
    partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the temporary
    unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake,
    Texas facility. Acetyl Intermediates also received
    $35 million of insurance recoveries from our captive
    insurance companies relating to the unplanned outage of the
    acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. This amount
    is included in Acetyl Intermediates’ other charges but is
    properly eliminated in our consolidated statements of
    operations. Operating profit also includes a gain on the sale of
    our Edmonton facility of $12 million.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased $175 million to $694 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006 primarily driven by higher operating profit and
    an increase in dividend income from our cost investments.
    Dividend income from Ibn Sina cost investment increased
    $24 million due to increased earnings for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006.

Other
    Activities

Net sales for Other Activities decreased to $2 million from
    $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was
    principally driven by the decrease in third-party revenues from
    our captive insurance companies.

Operating loss increased to $228 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to $190 million in the same
    period in 2006. This increase was principally driven by an
    increase in other charges more than offsetting a decrease in
    selling, general and administrative expenses. Other charges
    increased primarily due to $59 million of deferred
    compensation plan costs expensed in 2007. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses decreased for the



year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the absence
    of executive severance and legal costs associated with the
    Squeeze-Out of $23 million and long-term incentive plan
    expenses of $20 million recorded in 2006.

Loss from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased $277 million to $699 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. The increase was primarily driven by the
    increase in operating loss discussed above and higher
    refinancing expenses incurred in 2007, partially offset by lower
    interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    we incurred $256 million of refinancing expenses associated
    with the April 2, 2007 debt refinancing. Interest expense
    decreased $31 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006
    primarily related to lower interest rates on the new senior
    credit agreement compared to the interest rates on the senior
    discount notes and senior subordinated notes, which were repaid
    in April 2007 in conjunction with the debt refinancing. In
    addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we
    incurred $26 million of mark-to-market loss on the cross
    currency swap and the Euro denominated term loan that had been
    used as a hedge of our net investment in our European
    subsidiaries.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from
    operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends
    from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, we
    have a $650 million revolving credit facility and a
    $228 million credit-linked revolving facility to assist, if
    required, in meeting our working capital needs and other
    contractual obligations. In excess of 20 lenders participate in
    our revolving credit facility, each with a commitment of not
    more than 10% of the $650 million commitment. Further,
    Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., which filed for protection under
    Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in
    September 2008, is not a lender under our revolving credit
    facility and we do not have any other material direct exposure
    to Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.

While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service
    requirements over the next several years are significant, we
    continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our
    liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the
    remainder of 2009. If our cash flow from operations is
    insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we
    may be required to use other means available to us such as
    increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital
    expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to
    restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no
    assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows
    at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain
    our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities.

On a stand-alone basis, Celanese Corporation has no material
    assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries and no
    independent external operations of our own. As such, we
    generally will depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries to
    meet our obligations under our preferred stock, our
    Series A common stock and our senior credit agreement.

Cash
    Flows

Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2008 were
    $676 million, which was a decrease of $149 million
    from December 31, 2007. Cash and cash equivalents as of
    December 31, 2007 were $825 million, which was an
    increase of $34 million from December 31, 2006. See
    below for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents
    from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 and the
    change in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2006
    to December 31, 2007.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased
    $20 million to a cash inflow of $586 million in 2008
    from a cash inflow of $566 million for the same period in
    2007. Operating cash flows were favorably impacted by positive
    trade working capital changes ($202 million), lower cash
    taxes paid ($83 million) and the absence of adjustments to
    cash for discontinued operations. Adjustments to cash for
    discontinued operations of $84 million during 2007 related
    primarily to working capital changes of the oxo products and
    derivatives businesses and the shut down of our Edmonton,
    Alberta,  Canada methanol facility. Offsetting the increase in
    cash flows were an increase in net cash interest paid
    ($78 million), cash spent on legal settlements
    ($134 million) and decreased operating profit during the
    period.

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased to a cash
    inflow of $566 million in 2007 compared to a cash inflow of
    $751 million for the same period in 2006. The decrease in
    operating cash flows was primarily due to



adjustments to cash for discontinued operations and an increase
    in working capital, partially offset by an increase in earnings
    from continuing operations. Earnings from continuing operations
    increased to $336 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared with $319 million for the
    same period in 2006.

Net Cash
    Provided by/Used in Investing Activities

Net cash from investing activities decreased from a cash inflow
    of $143 million in 2007 to a cash outflow of
    $201 million in 2008. Net cash from investing activities
    decreased primarily due to cash spent in settlement of our cross
    currency swaps of $93 million (see Note 22 to the
    consolidated financial statements) and the absence of proceeds
    from the sale of our oxo products and derivatives businesses
    during 2007. These amounts were offset by net cash received on
    the sale of marketable securities ($111 million) and the
    excess of cash received from Fraport over amounts spent in
    connection with the Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation.

Net cash from investing activities improved to a cash inflow of
    $143 million in 2007 compared to a cash outflow of
    $268 million in 2006. The increase in cash inflow was
    primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our oxo products
    and derivatives businesses partially offset by the cash outflow
    for the APL acquisition. Additionally, our cash outflow for
    capital expenditures during the year ended December 31,
    2007 was $44 million higher compared to the same period in
    2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we increased
    restricted cash by $42 million related to the anticipated
    payment to minority shareholders for their remaining Celanese
    GmbH, formerly Celanese AG, shares. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, as a result of the completion of the
    Squeeze-Out (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial
    statements) and the payment to minority shareholders for their
    remaining Celanese GmbH shares, restricted cash decreased
    $46 million.

Our cash outflow for capital expenditures were
    $274 million, $288 million and $244 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, excluding amounts related to the relocation of our
    Ticona plant in Kelsterbach. Capital expenditures were primarily
    related to major replacements of equipment, capacity expansions,
    major investments to reduce future operating costs and
    environmental, health and safety initiatives. Capital
    expenditures in 2008, 2007 and 2006 included costs for the
    expansion of our Nanjing, China site into an integrated chemical
    complex. Cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to
    be approximately $175 million in 2009, excluding amounts
    related to the relocation of our Ticona plant in Kelsterbach.

On February 5, 2009, we received approximately
    €322 million of cash from Fraport in connection with
    the Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation, excluding value-added
    tax of €59 million. We anticipate related cash
    outflows for capital expenditures in 2009 will range from $350
    to $370 million.

Net Cash
    Used in Financing Activities

Net cash from financing activities increased to a cash outflow
    of $499 million in 2008 compared to a cash outflow of
    $714 million during 2007. The increase primarily relates to
    the absence of cash outflows attributable to the debt
    refinancing in 2007. Also contributing to the increase, cash
    spent to repurchase shares was $25 million less during 2008
    than during 2007. Decreased cash received for stock option
    exercises of $51 million partially offset the increase.

Net cash from financing activities decreased to a cash outflow
    of $714 million in 2007 compared to a cash outflow of
    $108 million in the same period in 2006. The decrease
    primarily relates to the repurchase of shares of our
    Series A common stock and the debt refinancing as discussed
    in Note 17 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by
    $69 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock
    options. Primarily as a result of the debt refinancing, we
    incurred a net cash outflow of $119 million related to
    repayments of our debt and $240 million for various
    refinancing expenses during the year ended December 31,
    2007. Furthermore, we paid a total of $403 million to
    repurchase shares of our Series A common stock during the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

In addition, exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents
    decreased to an unfavorable currency effect of $35 million
    in 2008 compared to a favorable impact of $39 million in
    2007 and a favorable impact of $26 million in 2006.



Debt and
    Other Obligations

As of December 31, 2008, we had total debt of
    $3,533 million and cash and cash equivalents of
    $676 million, resulting in net debt of $2,857 million,
    a $126 million increase over December 31, 2007.
    Decreased cash of $149 million and noncash increases in
    debt of $102 million primarily resulting from new capital
    lease obligations were partially offset by net cash paydowns on
    debt of $98 million and favorable foreign currency impacts
    of $27 million.

Senior
    Credit Facilities

Our senior credit agreement consists of $2,280 million of
    US dollar-denominated and €400 million of
    Euro-denominated term loans due 2014, a $650 million
    revolving credit facility terminating in 2013 and a
    $228 million credit-linked revolving facility terminating
    in 2014. As of December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding
    borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
    credit facility; accordingly, $650 million remained
    available for borrowing. As of December 31, 2008, there
    were $91 million of letters of credit issued under the
    credit-linked revolving facility and $137 million remained
    available for borrowing. Our senior credit agreement requires us
    to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio
    not greater than 3.90 to 1.00 if there are outstanding
    borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The first lien
    senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of
    consolidated first lien senior secured debt to earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to
    adjustments identified in the credit agreement. See Note 14
    to the consolidated financial statements for additional
    information regarding our senior credit facilities.

Commitments
    Relating to Share Capital

Our Board of Directors adopted a policy of declaring, subject to
    legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share
    of our Series A common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per
    share unless our Board of Directors in its sole discretion
    determines otherwise. For the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid $24 million, $25 million
    and $26 million, respectively, in cash dividends on our
    Series A common stock. On January 5, 2009, we declared
    a $6 million cash dividend which was paid on
    February 1, 2009.

Holders of our perpetual preferred stock are entitled to
    receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out
    of funds legally available, quarterly cash dividends at the rate
    of 4.25% per annum, or $0.265625 per share of liquidation
    preference. Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from
    the date of initial issuance. The preferred stock is
    convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time into
    approximately 1.26 shares of our Series A common
    stock, subject to adjustments, per $25.00 liquidation preference
    of the preferred stock. For the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid $10 million annually of cash
    dividends on our preferred stock. On January 5, 2009, we
    declared a $3 million cash dividend on our convertible
    perpetual preferred stock, which was paid on February 1,
    2009.

Based upon the number of outstanding shares as of
    December 31, 2008, the cash dividends to be paid in 2009
    are expected to result in annual dividend payments similar to
    that paid in 2008.

We are secondarily liable under a lease agreement which we
    assigned to a third party. The lease expires on April 30,
    2012. The lease liability for the period from January 1,
    2009 to April 30, 2012 is estimated to be approximately
    $26 million.



Standby letters of credit of $91 million outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008 are irrevocable obligations of an issuing
    bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that
    certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with
    specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that
    material payments will be required under these agreements.

Other
    Obligations

Deferred Compensation.

In April 2007, certain
    participants in our 2004 deferred compensation plan elected to
    participate in a revised program, which includes both cash
    awards and restricted stock units. Under the revised program,
    participants relinquished their cash awards of up to
    $30 million that would have contingently accrued from

2007-2009

under the original plan. See additional discussion of the
    revised program in Note 20 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Based on current participation in the revised
    program, the awards aggregate to approximately $27 million
    plus notional earnings and will be recognized as expense through
    December 31, 2010. We expensed $8 million and
    $6 million during the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, related to the revised program.

In December 2008, we entered into time-vesting cash awards of
    $22 million with Celanese’s executive officers and
    certain other key employees. Each award of cash vests 30% on
    October 14, 2009, 30% on October 14, 2010 and 40% on
    October 14, 2011. In its sole discretion, the compensation
    committee of the Board of Directors may at any time convert all
    or a portion of the cash award to an award of time-vesting
    restricted stock units.

Pension and Other Postretirement
    Obligations.

Our contributions for pension and
    postretirement benefits are preliminarily estimated to be
    $40 million and $35 million, respectively, in 2009.

Domination Agreement.

The domination and
    profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination
    Agreement”) was approved at the Celanese GmbH, formerly
    known as Celanese AG, extraordinary shareholders’ meeting
    on July 31, 2004. The Domination Agreement between Celanese
    GmbH and the Purchaser became effective on October 1, 2004
    and cannot be terminated by the Purchaser in the ordinary course
    of business until September 30, 2009. Our subsidiaries,
    Celanese International Holdings Luxembourg S.à r.l.
    (“CIH”), formerly Celanese Caylux Holdings Luxembourg
    S.C.A., and Celanese US, have each agreed to provide the
    Purchaser with financing to strengthen the Purchaser’s
    ability to fulfill its obligations under, or in connection with,
    the Domination Agreement and to ensure that the Purchaser will
    perform all of its obligations under, or in connection with, the
    Domination Agreement when such obligations become due,
    including, without limitation, the obligation to compensate
    Celanese GmbH for any statutory annual loss incurred by Celanese
    GmbH during the term of the Domination Agreement. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under such guarantees
    or other security to the Purchaser, we may not have sufficient
    funds for payments on our indebtedness when due. We have not had
    to compensate Celanese GmbH for an annual loss for any period
    during which the Domination Agreement has been in effect.

Purchases
    of Treasury Stock

In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $400 million of our Series A
    common stock. This authorization was increased to
    $500 million in October 2008. The authorization gives
    management discretion in determining the conditions under which
    shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have
    an expiration date. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, we repurchased 9,763,200 shares of our Series A
    common stock at an average purchase price of $38.68 per share
    for a total of approximately $378 million in connection
    with this authorization.

These purchases reduced the number of shares outstanding and the
    repurchased shares may be used by us for compensation programs
    utilizing our stock and other corporate purposes. We account for
    treasury stock using the cost method and include treasury stock
    as a component of Shareholders’ equity.

Plumbing
    Actions

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims
    incidental to the normal conduct of our business. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were reserves of
    $64 million and $65 million, respectively, related to
    plumbing action litigation. Although it is impossible at this
    time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these
    matters, we believe, based on the advice of legal counsel, that
    adequate provisions have been made and that the



ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, but could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting
    period.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection
    and application of significant accounting policies. The
    preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
    the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated charges
    during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any
    reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in
    materially different results.

We believe the following accounting polices and estimates are
    critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present
    in the current economic environment. These matters, and the
    judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential
    to understanding our reported and future operating results. See
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more
    comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies.

Recoverability
    of Long-Lived Assets

We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, whenever events
    or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
    long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Examples of a change in
    events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a
    decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a history of
    cash flow losses related to the use of the long-lived asset or a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a
    long-lived asset is being used. To assess the recoverability of
    long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets, we compare the carrying amount of the
    long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets to the future net
    undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
    long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets. If such
    long-lived assets are considered impaired, the impairment
    recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the long-lived assets exceeds the fair value of the
    long-lived assets.

We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually
    during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June 30
    balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully
    recoverable. Recoverability of goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured using a
    discounted cash flow model. We periodically engage a third-party
    valuation consultant to assist us with this process.

The development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections
    and the discounted cash flow projections require management
    projections related to sales and profitability trends, other
    future results of operations and discount rates. These
    projections, which require significant judgment, are consistent
    with projections we use to manage our operations internally. To
    the extent that changes in the current business environment
    result in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may
    occur in future periods.

Income
    Taxes

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable
    income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. Such evaluations require
    significant management



judgments. Valuation allowances have been established primarily
    on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax
    assets in the US, the United Kingdom and Canada.

We record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that
    may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax
    authorities. We recognize tax benefits when it is more likely
    than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical
    merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.
    Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are
    measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest
    amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
    realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of
    judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that
    position evaluated in light of all available evidence. The
    actual outcome of the future tax consequence could differ from
    our estimate due to changes in future circumstances and may have
    a material impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Benefit
    Obligations

We have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering
    substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements.
    With respect to its US qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    minimum funding requirements are determined by the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act based on years of service

and/or

compensation. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of
    the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These
    assumptions include the weighted average discount rate,
    compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan
    assets and trends in health care costs. In addition to the above
    mentioned assumptions, actuarial consultants use subjective
    factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the
    projected benefit obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may
    differ materially from actual results due to changing market and
    economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer
    or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may
    result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense
    recorded in future periods.

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements
    related to pension and other postretirement benefits are
    determined on an actuarial basis. A significant assumption used
    in determining our pension expense is the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. As of December 31, 2008, we
    assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of
    8.5% for the US qualified defined benefit pension plan, which
    represents approximately 83% and 78% of our pension plan assets
    and liabilities, respectively. On average, the actual return on
    these plan assets over the long-term (15 to 20 years) has
    exceeded 9.0%.

We estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected
    long-term rate of return for the US qualified defined benefit
    pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated
    $5 million in 2008. Another estimate that affects our
    pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount
    rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and
    other postretirement benefit plan obligations. At the end of
    each year, we determine the appropriate discount rate, used to
    determine the present value of future cash flows currently
    expected to be required to settle the pension and other
    postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is
    generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate
    fixed-income securities. As of December 31, 2008, we
    increased the discount rate to 6.50% from 6.30% as of
    December 31, 2007 for the US plans. We estimate that a
    50 basis point decline in our discount rate will decrease
    our annual pension expenses by an estimated $1 million, and
    increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $144 million for our US pension plan. In addition, the same
    basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase our
    annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than
    $1 million and $8 million respectively, for our US
    postretirement medical plans. We estimate that a 50 basis
    point decline in the discount rate for the non-US pension and
    postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other
    postretirement benefit annual expenses by approximately
    $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and
    will increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $30 million and $2 million, respectively.

Other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life
    insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service
    requirements. The key determinants of the accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) are the
    discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate. The healthcare
    cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts
    of APBO and related expense. For example, increasing or
    decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage
    point in each year would result in the APBO as of
    December 31, 2008, and the 2008 postretirement benefit cost
    to change by approximately $3 million and
    $(3) million, respectively. See Note 15 to the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information.



Accounting
    for Commitments and Contingencies

We are subject to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits,
    claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of
    our business, relating to and including product liability,
    patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices, release of chemicals
    into the environment and employment matters, which are handled
    and defended in the ordinary course of business. We routinely
    assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
    these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably
    estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by
    us after considering a broad range of information including:
    notifications, demands, settlements which have been received
    from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates
    performed by independent consultants and outside counsel,
    available facts, identification of other potentially responsible
    parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior
    experience. With respect to environmental liabilities, it is our
    policy to accrue through fifteen years, unless we have
    government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen
    years. A determination of the amount of loss contingency
    required, if any, is assessed in accordance with FASB Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,

Contingencies and Commitments,

and recorded if probable
    and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter.
    The required reserves may change in the future due to new
    developments in each matter and as additional information
    becomes available.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
    Risks

Our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
    Exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety
    of techniques, including use of derivatives. We have in place
    policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates,
    interest rates and commodity prices as described below.
    Contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under
    Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”) amended by
    SFAS No. 138,

Accounting for Certain Derivative
    Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities

and
    SFAS No. 148,

Amendment of Statement 133 on
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate
    risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of
    borrowing. To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our
    variable rate debt, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to
    convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate
    obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are designated
    as cash flow hedges.

In March 2007, in anticipation of the April 2007 debt
    refinancing, we entered into various US dollar and Euro interest
    rate swap agreements, which became effective on April 2,
    2007, with notional amounts of $1.6 billion and
    €150 million, respectively. The notional amount of the
    $1.6 billion US dollar interest rate swaps decreased by
    $400 million effective January 2, 2008 and decreased
    by another $200 million effective January 2, 2009. To
    offset the declines, we entered into US dollar interest rate
    swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million which
    became effective on January 2, 2008 and an additional US
    dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of
    $200 million which will become effective April 2, 2009.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $2.3 billion,
    €454 million and CNY 1.5 billion of variable rate
    debt, of which $1.6 billion and €150 million is
    hedged with interest rate swaps, which leaves $674 million,
    €304 million and CNY 1.5 billion of variable rate
    debt subject to interest rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1%
    increase in interest rates would increase annual interest
    expense by approximately $13 million.

See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our interest rate risk management  and the
    related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.



Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

The primary business objective of this hedging program is to
    maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign
    currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from
    exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are
    minimized. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and
    to conduct operations either within functional currencies or
    using the protection of hedge strategies. Accordingly, we enter
    into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our
    exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. From time to time we
    may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted
    transactions. Forward contracts are not designated as hedges
    under SFAS No. 133.

The following table indicates the total US dollar equivalents of
    net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign
    exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency. All of the
    contracts included in the table below will have approximately
    offsetting effects from actual underlying payables, receivables,
    intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to
    foreign exchange remeasurement.

Additionally, a portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar,
    principally the Euro. Fluctuations in the value of these
    currencies against the US dollar, particularly the value of the
    Euro, can have a direct and material impact on the business and
    financial results. For example, a decline in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar results in a decline in the US dollar
    value of our sales and earnings denominated in Euros due to
    translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar would result in an opposite effect.

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
    a foreign operation, we entered into cross currency swaps with
    certain financial institutions in 2004. The cross currency swaps
    and the Euro-denominated portion of the senior term loan were
    designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign
    operation. We dedesignated the net investment hedge due to the
    debt refinancing in April 2007 and redesignated the cross
    currency swaps and new senior EURO term loan in July 2007. As a
    result, we recorded $26 million of

mark-to-market

losses related to the cross currency swaps and the new senior
    Euro term loan during this period.

Under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, we paid
    approximately €13 million in interest and received
    approximately $16 million in interest on June 15 and
    December 15 of each year. The fair value of the net obligation
    under the cross currency swaps was included in current Other
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of
    December 31, 2007. Upon maturity of the cross currency swap
    arrangements in June 2008, we owed €276 million
    ($426 million) and were owed $333 million. In
    settlement of the obligation, we paid $93 million (net of
    interest of $3 million) in June 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we dedesignated
    €385 million of the €400 million
    euro-denominated portion of the term loan, previously designated
    as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation. Prior to
    this dedesignation, we had been using external derivative
    contracts to offset foreign currency exposures on



intercompany loans. The foreign currency exposure resulting from
    dedesignation of €385 million of the hedge of a net
    investment of a foreign operation is expected to offset the
    foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans,
    decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and
    reducing our exposure to external counterparties. The remaining
    €15 million euro-denominated portion of the term loan
    continues to be designated as a hedge of a net investment of a
    foreign operation.

See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and
    the related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Commodity
    Risk Management

We have exposure to the prices of commodities in its procurement
    of certain raw materials. We manage its exposure primarily
    through the use of long-term supply agreements and derivative
    instruments. We regularly assess our practice of purchasing a
    portion of its commodity requirements forward and utilization of
    other raw material hedging instruments, in addition to forward
    purchase contracts, in accordance with changes in market
    conditions. Forward purchases and swap contracts for raw
    materials are principally settled through actual delivery of the
    physical commodity. For qualifying contracts, we have elected to
    apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception of
    SFAS No. 133, as amended, as it was probable at the
    inception and throughout the term of the contract that they
    would not settle net and would result in physical delivery. As
    such, realized gains and losses on these contracts are included
    in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

In addition, we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to
    hedge a component of a raw material or energy source. Typically,
    these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
    These instruments are marked to market at each reporting period
    and gains (losses) are included in Cost of sales in the
    consolidated statements of operations. We recognized no gain or
    loss from these types of contracts during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and less than $1 million during each
    of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any
    open financial derivative contracts for commodities.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the
    Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
    our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable
    assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are
    made in accordance with management authorization; and providing
    reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
    disposition of company assets that could have a material effect
    on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting is not intended to
    provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our
    consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2008. KPMG LLP has audited
    this assessment of our internal control over financial
    reporting; their report is included below.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying report of management on internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Celanese Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 12,
    2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008.
    These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
    with US generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 12, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

, during the year ended December 31, 2008.

As discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes

, during the year ended December 31,
    2007.

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

,
    during the year ended December 31, 2006.

As discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

, during the year ended December 31, 2006.

    conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
    the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated charges
    during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to
    impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived
    assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and
    other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other
    postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations,
    environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

•
    Cash and cash equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered cash equivalents.

•
    Inventories

Inventories, including stores and supplies, are stated at the
    lower of cost or market. Cost for inventories is determined
    using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost includes raw
    materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost for
    stores and supplies is primarily determined by the average cost
    method.

•
    Investments in marketable securities

The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity
    securities as “available-for-sale” and reports those
    investments at their fair market values in the consolidated
    balance sheets as Marketable Securities, at fair value.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Unrealized gains or losses, net of the related tax effect on
    available-for-sale securities, are excluded from earnings and
    are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net until realized. The cost of securities sold
    is determined by using the specific identification method.

A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security
    below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in
    a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment
    is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is
    established. To determine whether impairment is
    other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the
    ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price
    recovery and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is
    recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence
    considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the
    impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes
    in value subsequent to year end and forecasted performance of
    the investee.

•
    Investments in affiliates

Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments
    in Common Stock

, stipulates that the equity method should be
    used to account for investments whereby an investor has
    “the ability to exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of an investee”, but does
    not exercise control. APB Opinion No. 18 generally
    considers an investor to have the ability to exercise
    significant influence when it owns 20% or more of the voting
    stock of an investee. Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 35,

Criteria for
    Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
    Common Stock

, which was issued to clarify the criteria for
    applying the equity method of accounting to 50% or less owned
    companies, lists circumstances under which, despite 20%
    ownership, an investor may not be able to exercise significant
    influence. Certain investments where the Company owns greater
    than a 20% ownership and cannot exercise significant influence
    or control are accounted for under the cost method (Note 8).

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    its investments whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline.
    A loss in value of an equity-method or cost-method investment
    which is other than a temporary decline will be recognized as
    the difference between the carrying amount of the investment and
    its fair value.

The Company’s estimates of fair value are determined based
    on a discounted cash flow model. The Company periodically
    engages third-party valuation consultants to assist with this
    process.

•
    Property, plant and equipment, net

Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings, machinery and
    equipment, including capitalized interest, and property under
    capital lease agreements, are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
    basis over the following estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets:

Land Improvements

20 years

Buildings and Building Improvements

30 years

Machinery and Equipment

20 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over ten years or the
    remaining life of the respective lease, whichever is shorter.

Accelerated depreciation is recorded when the estimated useful
    life is shortened. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs,
    including costs for planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not
    extend the useful life of the asset are charged to earnings as
    incurred. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and
    depreciation accounts until sold or otherwise disposed. In the
    case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed
    from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from
    disposal, are included in earnings.

The Company also leases property, plant and equipment under
    operating and capital leases. Rent expense for operating leases,
    which may have escalating rentals or rent holidays over the term
    of the lease, is recorded on a

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization of capital
    lease assets is included as a component of depreciation expense.

Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their
    fair values and depreciated over the assets’ remaining
    useful lives or the Company’s policy lives, whichever is
    shorter.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount
    of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would
    be assessed when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from
    the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than
    the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have
    identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other
    asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the
    excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair
    value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or
    independent appraisals, as appropriate. Impairment losses are
    recorded in depreciation expense or Other (charges) gains, net
    depending on the facts and circumstances.

•
    Goodwill and other intangible assets

Trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangible assets
    and other intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The
    weighted average amortization period is 8 years. The excess
    of the purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets
    and liabilities of an acquired business (“goodwill”)
    and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized,
    but rather tested for impairment, at least annually. The Company
    tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset
    impairment during the third quarter of its fiscal year using
    June 30 balances.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill
    of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability
    is measured at the reporting unit level based on the provisions
    of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

. The Company’s estimates of fair
    value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. The
    Company periodically engages third-party valuation consultants
    to assist with this process. Impairment losses are recorded in
    other operating expense or Other (charges) gains, net depending
    on the facts and circumstances.

The Company assesses recoverability of other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the indefinite-lived intangible asset may not be fully
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset over its
    fair value. Any excess of the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value is
    recognized as an impairment loss. The Company’s estimates
    of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow
    model. The Company periodically engages third-party valuation
    consultants to assist with this process. Impairment losses are
    recorded in other operating expense or Other (charges) gains,
    net depending on the facts and circumstances.

The Company assesses the recoverability of finite-lived
    intangible assets in the same manner as for property, plant and
    equipment as described above. Impairment losses are recorded in
    amortization expense or Other (charges) gains, net depending on
    the facts and circumstances.

•
    Financial instruments

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”) for financial assets
    and liabilities.  On January 1, 2009, the Company applied
    the provisions of SFAS No. 157 for non-recurring fair
    value measurements of non-financial assets and liabilities, such
    as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, property, plant
    and equipment and asset retirement obligations. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 for non-recurring fair value measurements
    of non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows. SFAS No. 157 defines fair
    value, and increases disclosures surrounding fair value
    calculations.

The Company manages its exposures to currency exchange rates,
    interest rates and commodity prices through a risk management
    program that includes the use of derivative financial
    instruments (Note 22). The Company does not use derivative
    financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The fair
    value of all derivative instruments is recorded as assets or
    liabilities at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value
    of these instruments are reported in income or Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net, depending on the use of the
    derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment under the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

, as amended (“SFAS No. 133”).

Gains and losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash
    flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net, to the extent the hedges are effective,
    until the underlying transactions are recognized in income. To
    the extent effective, gains and losses on derivative and
    non-derivative instruments used as hedges of the Company’s
    net investment in foreign operations are recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), net as part of the cumulative
    translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow
    hedges and hedges of net investment in foreign operations, if
    any, are recognized in income immediately. Derivative
    instruments not designated as hedges are marked to market at the
    end of each accounting period with the change in fair value
    recorded in income.

•
    Concentrations of credit risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment
    by customers and counterparties. The creditworthiness of
    customers and counterparties is subject to continuing review,
    including the use of master netting agreements, where the
    Company deems appropriate. The Company minimizes concentrations
    of credit risk through its global orientation in diverse
    businesses with a large number of diverse customers and
    suppliers. In addition, credit risks arising from derivative
    instruments is not significant because the counterparties to
    these contracts are primarily major international financial
    institutions and, to a lesser extent, major chemical companies.
    Where appropriate, the Company has diversified its selection of
    counterparties. Generally, collateral is not required from
    customers and counterparties and allowances are provided for
    specific risks inherent in receivables.

•
    Deferred financing costs

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred to obtain debt
    financings and amortizes these costs using a method that
    approximates the effective interest rate method over the terms
    of the related debt. Upon the extinguishment of the related
    debt, any unamortized capitalized debt financing costs are
    immediately expensed.

•
    Environmental liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical
    products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the
    production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling,
    processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials.
    The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating
    to environmental matters if available information indicates that
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of
    the site, the Company accrues through fifteen years, unless the
    Company has government orders or other agreements that extend
    beyond fifteen years. If the event of loss is neither probable
    nor reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible, the
    Company provides appropriate disclosure in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements if the contingency is
    considered material. The Company estimates environmental
    liabilities on a

case-by-case

basis using the most current status of available facts, existing
    technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior
    experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of
    environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets
    when their receipt is deemed probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated
    site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of
    the following types of costs: site investigation and testing
    costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water
    contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation
    monitoring costs. These reserves do not take into account any
    claims or recoveries from insurance. There are no pending
    insurance claims for any

F-10


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

environmental liability that are expected to be material. The
    measurement of environmental liabilities is based on the
    Company’s periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform
    each of the elements of the remediation effort. The Company
    utilizes third parties to assist in the management and
    development of cost estimates for its sites. Changes to
    environmental regulations or other factors affecting
    environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated
    financial statements in the period in which they occur
    (Note 16).

•
    Legal fees

The Company accrues for legal fees related to loss contingency
    matters when the costs associated with defending these matters
    can be reasonably estimated and are probable of occurring. All
    other legal fees are expensed as incurred.

•
    Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have
    been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment of products, and provided that four basic criteria are
    met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and
    (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Should changes in
    conditions cause the Company to determine revenue recognition
    criteria are not met for certain transactions, revenue
    recognition would be delayed until such time that the
    transactions become realizable and fully earned. Payments
    received in advance of meeting the above revenue recognition
    criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.

•
    Research and development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense
    in the period in which they are incurred.

•
    Insurance loss reserves

The Company has two wholly owned insurance companies (the
    “Captives”) that are used as a form of self insurance
    for property, liability and workers compensation risks. One of
    the Captives also insures certain third-party risks. The
    liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated
    risk of loss which is based on management estimates and
    actuarial valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the
    portion of the third-party premiums written applicable to the
    unexpired terms of the policies in-force. Liabilities are
    recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been
    developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and the
    Company can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition,
    liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure
    on both known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the
    liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly. It is possible
    that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded
    liabilities. Premiums written are recognized as revenue based on
    the terms of the policies. Capitalization of the Captives is
    determined by regulatory guidelines.

•
    Reinsurance receivables

The Captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their
    risk of loss. The reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the
    Captives from their obligations to policyholders. Failure of the
    reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to
    the Captives. The Captives evaluate the financial condition of
    their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to
    minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
    insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed
    non-collectible.

•
    Income taxes

The provision for income taxes has been determined using the
    asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
    Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
    effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
    amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and
    tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these
    temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are
    expected to apply to the period when the asset is

F-11


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on
    tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as
    of the balance sheet date.

The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

(“FIN 48”) on January 1,
    2007. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and
    estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require
    periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate
    actual outcomes. Tax positions are recognized only when it is
    more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on
    technical merits, that the positions will be sustained upon
    examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
    threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as
    the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax
    position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts
    and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all
    available evidence.

•
    Minority interests

Minority interests in the equity and results of operations of
    the entities consolidated by the Company are shown as a separate
    line item in the consolidated financial statements. The entities
    included in the consolidated financial statements that have
    minority interests are as follows:

    GmbH, which results in the Company controlling this entity and,
    accordingly, the Company is consolidating this entity in its
    consolidated financial statements.

•
    Accounting for purchasing agent agreements

A subsidiary of the Company acts as a purchasing agent on behalf
    of the Company, as well as third parties. The entity arranges
    sale and purchase agreements for raw materials on a commission
    basis. Accordingly, the commissions earned on these third-party
    sales are classified as a reduction to Selling, general and
    administrative expenses.

•
    Functional and reporting currencies

For the Company’s international operations where the
    functional currency is other than the US dollar, assets and
    liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates,
    while the statement of operations amounts are translated using
    the average exchange rates for the respective period.
    Differences arising from the translation of assets and
    liabilities in comparison with the translation of the previous
    periods or from initial recognition during the period are
    included as a separate component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net.

•
    Reclassifications

The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to
    conform to the current year presentation.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS No. 160”) to establish accounting
    and reporting standards for

the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single
    method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership
    interest in a subsidiary that does not result in
    deconsolidation. The Company adopted SFAS No. 160  on
    January 1, 2009. This standard had no material impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”).
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its
    financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, the goodwill acquired and any
    non-controlling interest in the acquiree. This statement also
    establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of
    the nature of the financial effect of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for all business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
    beginning of the first fiscal year after December 15, 2008,
    with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on
    deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies.
    SFAS No. 141(R) amends SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, such that adjustments made
    to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax
    contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to
    the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R) would also apply
    the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R). The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 141(R) on January 1, 2009. Beginning in
    2009, the Company will record adjustments to preacquisition tax
    contingencies as a component of income tax expense in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

(“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161
    requires enhanced disclosures about a company’s derivative
    and hedging activities. These enhanced disclosures will discuss:
    (a) how and why a company uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133 and its related
    interpretations and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect a company’s financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows. The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009. This standard
    had no impact on the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

FAS No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP

FAS No. 142-3”).

FSP

FAS No. 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

. The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency
    between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the
    period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of
    the asset under SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

, and other US GAAP. The Company
    adopted FSP

FAS No. 142-3

on January 1, 2009. This standard had no material impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

,
    (“SFAS No. 162”), which became effective
    November 15, 2008. SFAS No. 162 identifies the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles to be used in the preparation of financial
    statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in
    conformity with US GAAP. This standard had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In September 2008, the EITF issued EITF

No. 08-6,

Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations

(“EITF 08-6”).

EITF 08-6

addresses the effect of SFAS No. 141(R) and
    SFAS No. 160 on the equity method of accounting. The
    Company adopted

EITF 08-6

on January 1, 2009. This standard had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS

Acquisitions,
    Ventures, Divestitures and Asset Sales

Acquisitions

On January 31, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition
    of the cellulose acetate flake, tow and film business of Acetate
    Products Limited (“APL”), a subsidiary of Corsadi B.V.
    The purchase price for the transaction was approximately
    £57 million ($112 million), in addition to direct
    acquisition costs of approximately £4 million
    ($7 million). As contemplated prior to the closing of the
    acquisition, the Company closed the acquired tow production
    plant at Little Heath, United Kingdom in September 2007. In
    accordance with the Company’s sponsor services agreement
    dated January 26, 2005, as amended, the Company paid the
    Advisor $1 million in connection with the acquisition. The
    acquired business is included in the Company’s Consumer
    Specialties segment.

On April 6, 2004, the Company acquired 84% of Celanese
    GmbH. During 2005, the Company acquired an additional 14% of
    Celanese GmbH. On May 30, 2006, Celanese GmbH’s
    shareholders approved a transfer to the Purchaser of all shares
    owned by minority shareholders against payment of cash
    compensation in the amount of €66.99 per share (the
    “Squeeze-Out”). As a result of the effective
    registration of the Squeeze-Out in the commercial register in
    Germany in December 2006, the Company acquired the remaining 2%
    of Celanese GmbH in January 2007. The Company’s current
    ownership percentage in Celanese GmbH is 100%.

Ventures

In March 2007, the Company entered into a strategic partnership
    with Accsys Technologies PLC (“Accsys”), and its
    subsidiary, Titan Wood, to become the exclusive supplier of
    acetyl products to Titan Wood’s technology licensees for
    use in wood acetylation. In connection with this partnership, in
    May 2007, the Company acquired 8,115,883 shares of
    Accsys’ common stock representing approximately 5.45% of
    the total voting shares of Accsys for €22 million
    ($30 million). The investment was treated as an
    available-for-sale security and was included in Marketable
    securities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. On
    November 20, 2007, the Company and Accsys announced that
    they agreed to amend their business arrangements so that each
    company would have a nonexclusive “at-will” trading
    and supply relationship to give both companies greater
    flexibility. As part of this amendment, the Company subsequently
    sold all of its shares of Accsys stock for approximately
    €20 million ($30 million), which resulted in a
    cumulative loss of $3 million.

Divestitures

In July 2008, the Company sold its 55.46% interest in Derivados
    Macroquimicos S.A. de C.V. (“DEMACSA”) for proceeds of
    $3 million. DEMACSA produces cellulose ethers at an
    industrial complex in Zacapu, Michoacan, Mexico and is included
    in the Company’s Acetyl Intermediates segment. In June
    2008, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1 million
    to Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
    As a result, the proceeds from the sale approximated the
    carrying value of DEMACSA on the date of the sale. The Company
    concluded the sale of DEMACSA is not a discontinued operation
    due to certain forms of continuing involvement between the
    Company and DEMACSA subsequent to the sale.

In August 2007, the Company sold its Films business of AT
    Plastics, located in Edmonton and Westlock, Alberta, Canada, to
    British Polythene Industries PLC (“BPI”) for
    $12 million. The Films business manufactures products for
    the agricultural, horticultural and construction industries. The
    Company recorded a loss on the sale of $7 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company maintained
    ownership of the Polymers business of AT Plastics, which
    concentrates on the development and supply of specialty resins
    and compounds. AT Plastics is included in the Company’s
    Industrial Specialties segment. The Company concluded that the
    sale of the Films business of AT Plastics is not a discontinued
    operation due to the level of continuing cash flows between the
    Films business and AT Plastics’ Polymers business
    subsequent to the sale. Under the terms of the purchase

agreement, the Company entered into a two year sales agreement
    to continue selling product to BPI through August 2009.

In December 2006, the Company sold its preferred interest in
    Pemeas GmbH, a venture formed in April 2004 to advance the
    commercialization of the Company’s fuel cell technology to
    BASF AG. The Company received net proceeds from the sale of
    €9 million and recognized a gain of
    €8 million ($11 million). This amount is included
    in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

In connection with the Company’s strategy to optimize its
    portfolio and divest non-core operations, the Company announced
    on December 13, 2006 its agreement to sell its Acetyl
    Intermediates segment’s oxo products and derivatives
    businesses, including European Oxo GmbH (“EOXO”), a
    50/50 venture between Celanese GmbH and Degussa AG
    (“Degussa”), to Advent International, for a purchase
    price of €480 million ($636 million) subject to
    final agreement adjustments and the successful exercise of the
    Company’s option to purchase Degussa’s 50% interest in
    EOXO. On February 23, 2007, the option was exercised and
    the Company acquired Degussa’s interest in the venture for
    a purchase price of €30 million ($39 million), in
    addition to €22 million ($29 million) paid to
    extinguish EOXO’s debt upon closing of the transaction. The
    Company completed the sale of its oxo products and derivatives
    businesses, including the acquired 50% interest in EOXO, on
    February 28, 2007. The sale included the oxo and
    derivatives businesses at the Oberhausen, Germany, and Bay City,
    Texas facilities as well as portions of its Bishop, Texas
    facility. Also included were EOXO’s facilities within the
    Oberhausen and Marl, Germany plants. The former oxo products and
    derivatives businesses acquired by Advent International was
    renamed Oxea. Taking into account agreed deductions by the buyer
    for pension and other employee benefits and various costs for
    separation activities, the Company received proceeds of
    approximately €443 million ($585 million) at
    closing. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a
    $47 million pre-tax gain, recorded to Gain (loss) on
    disposal of discontinued operations, which includes certain
    working capital and other adjustments, in 2007. Due to certain
    lease-back arrangements between the Company and the buyer and
    related environmental obligations of the Company, approximately
    $51 million of the transaction proceeds attributable to the
    fair value of the underlying land at Bay City ($1 million)
    and Oberhausen (€36 million) is included in deferred
    proceeds in noncurrent Other liabilities, and divested land with
    a book value of $14 million (€10 million at
    Oberhausen and $1 million at Bay City) remains in Property,
    plant and equipment, net in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets.

Subsequent to closing, the Company and Oxea have certain site
    service and product supply arrangements. The site services
    include, but are not limited to, administrative, utilities,
    health and safety, waste water treatment and maintenance
    activities for terms which range up to fifteen years. Product
    supply agreements contain initial terms of up to fifteen years.
    The Company has no contractual ability through these agreements
    or any other arrangements to significantly influence the
    operating or financial policies of Oxea. The Company concluded,
    based on the nature and limited projected magnitude of the
    continuing business relationship between the Company and Oxea,
    the divestiture of the oxo products and derivatives businesses
    should be accounted for as a discontinued operation.

Third-party net sales include $5 million and
    $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, that would have been eliminated upon
    consolidation were the divestiture not accounted for as a
    discontinued operation. These amounts relate to sales from the
    continuing operations of the Company to the divested businesses.

In accordance with the Company’s sponsor services agreement
    dated January 26, 2005, as amended, the Company paid the
    Advisor $6 million in connection with the sale of the oxo
    products and derivatives businesses.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company discontinued its
    pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations, which were included
    in the Acetyl Intermediates segment. During the second quarter
    of 2007, the Company discontinued its Edmonton, Alberta, Canada
    methanol operations, which were included in the Acetyl
    Intermediates segment. As a result, the earnings (loss) from
    operations related to the Edmonton methanol and PE operations
    are accounted for as discontinued operations.

Asset
    Sales

In May 2008, shareholders of the Company’s Koper, Slovenia
    legal entity voted to approve the April 2008 decision by the
    Company to permanently shut down this emulsions production site.
    The decision to shut down the site resulted in employee
    severance of less than $1 million, which is included in
    Other (charges) gains, net, in the consolidated statements of
    operations during the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Currently, the facility is idle and the existing fixed assets,
    including machinery and equipment, buildings and land are being
    marketed for sale. The Koper, Slovenia legal entity is included
    in the Company’s Industrial Specialties segment.

In December 2007, the Company sold the assets at its Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility to a real estate developer for
    approximately $35 million. As part of the agreement, the
    Company will retain certain environmental liabilities associated
    with the site. The Company derecognized $16 million of
    asset retirement obligations which were transferred to the
    buyer. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a gain of
    $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, of
    which a gain of $34 million was recorded to Gain (loss) on
    disposition of businesses and assets, net in the consolidated
    statements of operation.

In July 2007, the Company reached an agreement with
    Babcock & Brown, a worldwide investment firm which
    specializes in real estate and utilities development, to sell
    the Company’s Pampa, Texas, facility. The Company ceased
    operations at the site in December 2008. Proceeds received upon
    certain milestone events will be treated as deferred proceeds
    and included in noncurrent Other liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets until the transaction
    is complete (expected to be in 2010), as defined in the sales
    agreement. These operations are included in the Company’s
    Acetyl Intermediates segment. During the second half of 2008,
    the Company determined that two of the milestone events, which
    are outside of the Company’s control, were unlikely to be
    achieved. The Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis
    which resulted in a $23 million long-lived asset impairment
    loss recorded to Other (charges) gains, net, in the consolidated
    statements of operations during the year ended December 31,
    2008 (Note 18).

Certain cost investments where the Company owns greater than a
    20% ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method
    of accounting because the Company cannot exercise significant
    influence over these entities. The Company determined that it
    cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to
    local government investment in and influence over these
    entities, limitations on the Company’s involvement in the
    day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities
    to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance
    with US GAAP.

During 2007, the Company wrote-off its remaining
    €1 million ($1 million) cost investment in
    European Pipeline Development Company B.V. (“EPDC”)
    and expensed €7 million ($9 million), included in
    Other income (expense), net, associated with contingent
    liabilities that became payable due to the Company’s
    decision to exit the pipeline development project. In June 2008,
    the outstanding contingent liabilities were resolved and the
    Company recognized a gain of €2 million
    ($2 million), included in Other income (expense), net, in
    the consolidated statements of operations to remove the
    remaining accrual. The investment in EPDC related to the
    construction of a pipeline system, solely dedicated to the
    transportation of propylene, which was to connect Rotterdam via
    Antwerp, Netherlands, with the Company’s Oberhausen and
    Marl production facilities in Germany. However, on
    February 15, 2007, EPDC shareholders voted to cease the
    pipeline project as originally envisaged and go into
    liquidation. The Company was a 12.5% shareholder of EPDC.

During 2007, the Company fully impaired its $5 million cost
    investment in Elemica Corporation (“Elemica”). Elemica
    is a network for the global chemical industry developed by 22 of
    the leading chemical companies in the world for the benefit of
    the entire industry. The Company is a 1.83% shareholder of
    Elemica through its preferred share holdings. As part of
    Elemica’s planned capital reorganization in 2007, its board
    of directors has proposed to convert all outstanding preferred
    stock into shares of Elemica’s common stock. Based on the

Included in the asset retirement obligations for each of the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is
    $10 million related to a business acquired in 2005. The
    Company has a corresponding receivable for this amount included
    in noncurrent Other assets as of December 31, 2008.

The Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement
    obligations related to certain of its existing operating
    facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include
    demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration
    activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the
    retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or
    abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company
    currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities
    indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value
    cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company
    considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites,
    an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time.
    If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset
    retirement obligations could significantly affect the
    Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

Senior
    Credit Facilities

The Company’s senior credit agreement consists of
    $2,280 million of US dollar-denominated and
    €400 million of Euro-denominated term loans due 2014,
    a $650 million revolving credit facility terminating in
    2013 and a $228 million credit-linked revolving facility
    terminating in 2014. Borrowings under the senior credit
    agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on
    LIBOR (for US dollars) or EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable,
    or, for US dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances,
    a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The
    applicable margin for the term loans and any loans under the
    credit-linked revolving facility is 1.75%, subject to potential
    reductions as defined in the senior credit agreement. As of
    December 31, 2008, the applicable margin was 1.5% and
    continues to be subject to potential adjustments as defined in
    the senior credit agreement. The term loans

under the senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at
    1% of the initial principal amount per annum, payable quarterly.
    The remaining principal amount of the term loans is due on
    April 2, 2014.

As of December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding
    borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
    credit facility; accordingly, $650 million remained
    available for borrowing. As of December 31, 2008, there
    were $91 million of letters of credit issued under the
    credit-linked revolving facility and $137 million remained
    available for borrowing.

The senior credit agreement is guaranteed by Celanese Holdings
    LLC, a subsidiary of Celanese Corporation, and certain domestic
    subsidiaries of Celanese US, and is secured by a lien on
    substantially all assets of Celanese US and such guarantors,
    subject to certain agreed exceptions, pursuant to the Guarantee
    and Collateral Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2007, by and
    among Celanese Holdings LLC, Celanese US, certain subsidiaries
    of Celanese US and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as
    Administrative Agent and as Collateral Agent.

Our senior credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum
    first lien senior secured leverage ratio not greater than 3.90
    to 1.00 if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving
    credit facility. The first lien senior secured leverage ratio is
    calculated as the ratio of consolidated first lien senior
    secured debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization, subject to adjustments identified in the
    credit agreement. The Company is in compliance with all of the
    covenants related to its debt agreements as of
    December 31, 2008.

Debt
    Refinancing

In April 2007, the Company, through certain of its subsidiaries,
    entered into a new senior credit agreement. Proceeds from the
    new senior credit agreement, together with available cash, were
    used to retire the Company’s $2,454 million amended
    and restated (January 2005) senior credit facilities, which
    consisted of $1,626 million in term loans due 2011, a
    $600 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2009
    and a $228 million credit-linked revolving facility
    terminating in 2009, and to retire all of the Company’s
    9.625% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and
    10.375% senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the
    “Senior Subordinated Notes”) and 10% senior
    discount notes due 2014 and 10.5% senior discount notes due
    2014 (the “Senior Discount Notes”) as discussed below.

Substantially all of the Senior Discount Notes and Senior
    Subordinated Notes were tendered in the first quarter of 2007.
    The remaining outstanding Senior Discount Notes and Senior
    Subordinated Notes not tendered in conjunction with the Tender
    Offers were redeemed by the Company in May 2007 through optional
    redemption allowed in the indentures.

As a result of the refinancing, the Company incurred premiums
    paid on early redemption of debt, accelerated amortization and
    other refinancing expenses. The components of refinancing
    expenses are as follows:

    assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are being
    amortized over the term of the new senior credit agreement. The
    deferred financing costs consist of $23 million of costs

Benefit
    Obligations

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No.
    87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS No. 158”), on
    December 31, 2006 which caused the Company to recognize the
    unfunded status of its benefit plans of $113 million in the
    December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, with a
    corresponding adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net. The Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 158
    had no impact to the consolidated statements of operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2006.

Pension obligations.

Pension obligations are
    established for benefits payable in the form of retirement,
    disability and surviving dependent pensions. The benefits
    offered vary according to the legal, fiscal and economic
    conditions of each country. The commitments result from
    participation in defined contribution and defined benefit plans,
    primarily in the US. Benefits are dependent on years of service
    and the employee’s compensation. Supplemental retirement
    benefits provided to certain employees are nonqualified for US
    tax purposes. Separate trusts have been established for some
    nonqualified plans. Pension costs under the Company’s
    retirement plans are actuarially determined.

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s US qualified pension plan represents
    approximately 83% and 78% of the Company’s pension plan
    assets and liabilities, respectively. Independent trusts or
    insurance companies administer the majority of these plans. The
    US qualified defined benefit plan’s actual return on assets
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 was a loss of 18%
    versus an expected long-term rate of asset return assumption of
    8.5%. The overall performance of the portfolio suffered due to
    the significant declines in the global equity markets. The
    returns on equity investments for this plan were negative while
    the returns on fixed income investments were positive.

The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia covering certain employees. Employees
    may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these
    contributions in varying amounts. The Company’s matching
    contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on
    specified percentages of employee contributions and aggregated
    $13 million, $12 million and $11 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company participates in multiemployer defined benefit
    pension plans in Europe covering certain employees. The
    Company’s contributions to the multiemployer defined
    benefit pension plans are based on specified percentages of
    employee contributions and aggregated $7 million, for each
    of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Other postretirement obligations.

Certain
    retired employees receive postretirement healthcare and life
    insurance benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which
    has the right to modify or terminate these plans at any time.
    The cost for coverage is shared between the Company and the
    retiree. The cost of providing retiree

health care and life insurance benefits is actuarially

    employee group. The Company’s policy is to fund benefits as
    claims and premiums are paid. The US plan was closed to new
    participants effective January 1, 2006.

Valuation

The Company uses the corridor approach in the valuation of the
    defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits. The
    corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses
    resulting from variances between actual results and economic
    estimates or actuarial assumptions. For defined benefit pension
    plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when
    the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the
    market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. For other
    postretirement benefits, amortization occurs when the net gains
    and losses exceed 10% of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. The amount in excess of
    the corridor is amortized over the average remaining service
    period to retirement date for active plan participants or, for
    retired participants, the average remaining life expectancy.

The expected rate of return assumptions for plan assets are
    based mainly on historical performance achieved over a long
    period of time (15 to 20 years) encompassing many business
    and economic cycles. Adjustments, upward and

F-29


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

downward, may be made to those historical returns to reflect
    future capital market expectations; these expectations are
    typically derived from expert advice from the investment
    community and surveys of peer company assumptions.

The Company determines its assumption for the discount rates to
    be used for the purposes of computing annual service and
    interest costs for its US plans based on the yields of high
    quality corporate/government bonds with a duration appropriate
    to the duration of the plan obligations.

The Company determines its discount rates in the Euro zone using
    the iBoxx Euro Corporate AA Bond indices with appropriate
    adjustments for the duration of the plan obligations. In other
    international locations, the Company determines its discount
    rates based on the yields of high quality government bonds with
    a duration appropriate to the duration of the plan obligations.

On January 1, 2008, the Company’s health care cost
    trend assumption for US postretirement medical plan’s net
    periodic benefit cost was 9% for the first two years declining
    0.5% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. On January 1,
    2007, the health care cost trend rate was 8.5% per year
    declining 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
    one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed health
    care cost trend rate would impact postretirement obligations by
    $3 million and $(3) million, respectively. The effect
    of a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care
    cost trend rate would have a less than $1 million impact on
    service and interest cost.

The financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are
    established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each
    plan’s liability structure. The Company’s asset
    allocation policy is based on a detailed asset/liability
    analysis. In developing investment policy and financial goals,
    consideration is given to the plan’s demographics, the
    returns and risks associated with alternative investment
    strategies, and the current and projected cash, expense and
    funding ratios of the plan. The investment policy must also
    comply with local statutory requirements as determined by each
    country. A formal asset/liability mix study of the plan is
    undertaken every 3 to 5 years or whenever there has been a
    material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or
    funding status and investment market. The Company has adopted a
    long-term investment horizon such that the risk and duration of
    investment losses are weighed against the long-term

F-30


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

potential for appreciation of assets. Although there cannot be
    complete assurance that these objectives will be realized, it is
    believed that the likelihood for their realization is reasonably
    high, based upon the asset allocation chosen and the historical
    and expected performance of the asset classes utilized by the
    plans. The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified
    across asset classes, investment styles, investment managers,
    developed and emerging markets, business sectors and securities
    in order to moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments
    may be in separate accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and
    other pooled asset portfolios provided they all conform to
    fiduciary standards.

External investment managers are hired to manage the pension
    assets. An investment consultant assists with the screening
    process for each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the
    investment portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a
    composite of market indices that are weighted to match each
    plan’s target asset allocation. Long-term is considered 3
    to 5 years; however, incidences of underperformance are
    analyzed. The portfolio return should also (over the long term)
    meet or exceed the return used for actuarial calculations in
    order to minimize future pension contributions and escalation in
    pension expense.

Employer contributions for pension benefits and postretirement
    benefits are preliminarily estimated to be $40 million and
    $35 million, respectively, in 2009. The table below
    reflects pension benefits expected to be paid from the plan or

contractual agreements arising from the divestiture of certain
    businesses by the Company or one of its predecessor companies.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company’s expenditures, including expenditures for legal
    compliance, internal environmental initiatives and remediation
    of active, orphan, divested and US Superfund sites (as defined
    below) were $78 million, $83 million and
    $71 million, respectively. The Company’s capital
    project-related environmental expenditures for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $13 million,
    $14 million and $5 million, respectively.
    Environmental reserves for remediation matters were
    $98 million and $115 million as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, which represents the Company’s
    best estimate of its liability.

Remediation

Due to its industrial history and through retained contractual
    and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to
    remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on
    divested, orphan or US Superfund sites. In addition, as part of
    the demerger agreement between the Company and Hoechst, a
    specified portion of the responsibility for environmental
    liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was
    transferred to the Company. The Company provides for such
    obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably
    estimable.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    total remediation efforts charged to Cost of sales in the
    consolidated statements of operations were $3 million,
    $4 million and $6 million, respectively. The Company
    believes that environmental remediation costs will not have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position of the
    Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results
    of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period.

The Company did not record any insurance recoveries related to
    these matters for the reported periods. There are no receivables
    for insurance recoveries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    however, as of December 31, 2008, there is an
    $8 million receivable from a former owner of an acquired
    business.

German
    InfraServs

On January 1, 1997, coinciding with a reorganization of the
    Hoechst businesses in Germany, real estate service companies
    (“InfraServs”) were created to own directly the land
    and property and to provide various technical and administrative
    services at each of the manufacturing locations. The Company has
    manufacturing operations at the InfraServ location in Frankfurt
    am Main-Hoechst, Germany and holds interests in the companies
    which own and operate the former Hoechst sites in Gendorf,
    Knapsack and Wiesbaden.

InfraServs are liable for any residual contamination and other
    pollution because they own the real estate on which the
    individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, as the responsible party under German public
    law, is liable to third parties for all environmental damage
    that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and
    real estate. The contribution agreements entered into in 1997
    between Hoechst and the respective operating companies, as part
    of the divestiture of these companies, provide that the
    operating companies will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, against environmental liabilities resulting from the
    transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServs have agreed
    to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against any
    environmental liability arising out of or in connection with
    environmental pollution of any site. Likewise, in certain
    circumstances the Company could be responsible for the
    elimination of residual contamination on a few sites that were
    not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst,
    and its legal successors, must reimburse the Company for
    two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between
    the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination
    caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which
    cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no
    third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the
    InfraServ partnership. In view of this potential obligation to
    eliminate residual contamination, the InfraServs, primarily
    relating to equity and cost affiliates which are not
    consolidated by the Company, have reserves of $84 million
    and $88 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective
    indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination,
    the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ
    companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a
    number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are
    not satisfied by either the InfraServs or their owners, these
    liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with
    the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any
    such costs. Likewise, in certain circumstances the Company could
    be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on
    several sites that were not transferred to InfraServ companies,
    in which case Hoechst, and its legal successors, must also
    reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.
    The German InfraServs are owned partially by the Company, as
    noted below, and the remaining ownership is held by various
    other companies. The Company’s ownership interest and
    environmental liability participation percentages for such
    liabilities which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner
    were as follows as of December 31, 2008:

US
    Superfund Sites

In the US, the Company may be subject to substantial claims
    brought by US federal or state regulatory agencies or private
    individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In
    particular, the Company has a potential liability under the US
    Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws
    (collectively referred to as “Superfund”) for
    investigation and cleanup costs at approximately 50 sites. At
    most of these sites, numerous companies, including certain
    companies comprising the Company, or one of its predecessor
    companies, have been notified that the Environmental Protection
    Agency, state governing bodies or private individuals consider
    such companies to be potentially responsible parties
    (“PRP”) under Superfund or related laws. The
    proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The
    cleanup process has not been completed at most sites and the
    status of the insurance coverage for most of these proceedings
    is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot accurately
    determine its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup
    costs at these sites. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had provisions totaling $11 million and
    $13 million, respectively, for US Superfund sites and
    utilized $2 million, $1 million and $1 million of
    these reserves during the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Additional provisions and
    adjustments recorded during the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006 approximately offset these expenditures.

As events progress at each site for which it has been named a
    PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site
    cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these
    liabilities, the Company considers its shipment of waste to a
    site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the
    types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the
    magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the
    number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company will join
    with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that will
    settle, among PRPs, each party’s percentage allocation of
    costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ
    from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities
    and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most
    current information available.

Hoechst
    Liabilities

In connection with the Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to
    indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, for the first
    €250 million of future remediation liabilities for
    environmental damages arising from 19 specified divested Hoechst
    entities. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, reserves of
    $27 million and $27 million, respectively, for these
    matters are included as a component of the total environmental
    reserves. As of December 31, 2008 and

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2007, the Company, has made total cumulative payments of
    $48 million and $46 million, respectively. If such
    future liabilities exceed €250 million, Hoechst, and
    its legal successors, will bear such excess up to an additional
    €500 million. Thereafter, the Company will bear
    one-third and Hoechst, and its legal successors, will bear
    two-thirds of any further environmental remediation liabilities.
    Where the Company is unable to reasonably determine the
    probability of loss or estimate such loss under this
    indemnification, the Company has not recognized any liabilities
    relative to this indemnification.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has $240 million aggregate liquidation
    preference of outstanding 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred
    stock. Holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive,
    when, as and if, declared by the Company’s Board of
    Directors, out of funds legally available, cash dividends at the
    rate of 4.25% per annum of liquidation preference, payable
    quarterly in arrears, commencing on May 1, 2005. Dividends
    on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of initial
    issuance. Accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at an
    annual rate of 4.25%. The preferred stock is convertible, at the
    option of the holder, at any time into approximately
    1.26 shares of Series A common stock, subject to
    adjustments, per $25.00 liquidation preference of preferred
    stock and upon conversion will be recorded in the consolidated
    statements of shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income
    (loss).

During 2008 and 2007, the Company declared and paid
    $10 million of cash dividends in each period on its 4.25%
    convertible perpetual preferred stock.

Dividends

During 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a
    policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a
    quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company’s
    Series A common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per
    share unless the Company’s Board of Directors, in its sole
    discretion, determines otherwise. Further, such dividends
    payable to holders of the Company’s Series A common
    stock cannot be declared or paid nor can any funds be set aside
    for the payment thereof, unless the Company has paid or set
    aside funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid
    dividends with respect to the shares of the Company’s
    preferred stock, as described above. Additionally, the amount
    available to pay cash dividends is restricted by our senior
    credit agreement.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company declared and paid
    $24 million, $25 million and $26 million,
    respectively, of cash dividends to holders of its Series A
    common stock.

Treasury
    Stock

In conjunction with the April 2007 debt refinancing
    (Note 14), the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
    CIH, repurchased 2,021,775 shares of its outstanding
    Series A common stock in a modified “Dutch
    Auction” tender offer from public shareholders, which
    expired on April 3, 2007, at a purchase price of $30.50 per
    share. The total price paid for these shares was
    $62 million. The Company also separately purchased, through
    its wholly-owned subsidiary CIH, 329,011 shares of the
    Company’s Series A common stock at $30.50 per share
    from the investment funds associated with The Blackstone Group
    L.P. The total price paid for these shares was $10 million.

In June 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $330 million of its Series A
    common stock. During 2007, the Company repurchased
    8,487,700 shares of its Series A common stock at an
    average purchase price of $38.88 per share for a total of
    $330 million pursuant to this authorization. The Company
    completed repurchasing shares related to this authorization
    during July 2007.

In February 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of the
    Company’s Series A common stock. This authorization
    was increased to $500 million in October 2008. The
    authorization gives management discretion in determining the
    conditions under which shares may be repurchased.

    activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign the business
    operations, as well as costs incurred in connection with
    decisions to exit non-strategic businesses. These measures are
    based on formal management decisions, establishment of

Income tax provision




(1)

Includes impact of earnings from China and Singapore subject to
    tax holidays which expire between 2008 and 2013.

Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on
    accumulated but undistributed earnings of $2.5 billion as
    of December 31, 2008, as such earnings have been
    permanently reinvested in the business. The determination of the
    amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the
    undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 was 15% compared to 25% for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. The effective tax rate for
    2008 was favorably impacted by: (1) an increase in
    unrepatriated low-taxed earnings, including tax holidays,
    (2) tax credits generated in foreign jurisdictions and
    (3) the US tax impact of foreign operations.

The Company operates under tax holidays in various countries
    which are effective through December 2013. In China, one of the
    Company’s entities has a tax holiday that provides for a
    zero percent tax rate in 2007 and 2008. For 2009 through 2011,
    the Company’s tax rate will be 50% of the statutory rate,
    or 12.5% based on the 2008 statutory rate of 25%. In Singapore,
    one of the Company’s entities has a tax holiday that
    provides for a zero percent tax rate through 2010. For 2011
    through 2013, the Company’s tax rate will be 50% of the
    statutory rate, or 9% based on the current statutory rate of
    18%. The impact of these tax holidays decreased foreign taxes
    $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The Corporate Tax Reform Act of 2008 was signed by the German
    Federal President in August 2007. The Act reduced the
    Company’s combined corporate statutory tax rate from 40% to
    30% while imposing limitations on the deductibility of certain
    expenses, including interest expense. The Company recognized a
    tax benefit of approximately $39 million in 2007 related to
    the statutory rate reduction on its German net deferred tax
    liabilities.

Mexico enacted the 2008 Fiscal Reform Bill on October 1,
    2007. Effective January 1, 2008, the bill repealed the
    existing asset-based tax and established a dual income tax
    system consisting of a new minimum flat tax (the
    “IETU”) and the existing regular income tax system.
    The IETU system taxes companies on cash basis net income,
    consisting only of certain specified items of revenue and
    expense, at a rate of 16.5%, 17% and 17.5% for 2008, 2009

and 2010 forward, respectively. In general, companies must pay
    the higher of the income tax or the IETU, although unlike the
    previous asset tax, the IETU is not creditable against future
    income tax liabilities. The Company has determined that it will
    primarily be subject to the IETU in future periods, and as such
    it has recorded tax expense of approximately $20 million in
    2007 for the deferred tax effects of the new IETU system.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had US federal net
    operating loss carryforwards of approximately $298 million
    which will begin to expire in 2021. Of this amount,
    $53 million relates to the preacquisition period and is
    subject to limitation. Of the remaining $245 million,
    $153 million is subject to limitation as a result of the
    change in stock ownership in May 2006. This limitation is not
    expected to have a material impact on utilization of the net
    operating loss carryforwards.

The Company also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards as
    of December 31, 2008 of approximately $435 million for
    China, Germany, Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions with
    various expiration dates. Net operating losses in China have
    various carryforward periods and begin expiring in 2011. Net
    operating losses in Germany have no expiration date. Net
    operating losses in Mexico have a ten year carryforward period
    and begin to expire in 2009. However, these losses are not
    available for use under the new IETU tax regulations in Mexico.
    As the IETU is the primary system upon which the Company will be
    subject to tax in future periods, no deferred tax asset has been
    reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of
    December 31, 2008 for these income tax loss carryforwards.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective
    January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a
    tax benefit is required to meet before being recognized in the
    financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
    the Company increased Retained earnings by $14 million and
    decreased Goodwill by $2 million. In addition, certain tax
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, as well as related
    potential penalties and interest, were reclassified from current
    liabilities to noncurrent liabilities. Liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 relate to
    various US and foreign jurisdictions.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the unrecognized tax benefits as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 are $71 million and
    $56 million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company has recorded a
    liability of approximately $38 million and
    $36 million, respectively, for interest and penalties. This
    amount includes an increase of approximately $2 million and
    $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

The Company operates in the US (including multiple state
    jurisdictions), Germany and approximately 40 other foreign
    jurisdictions including Canada, China, France, Mexico and
    Singapore. Examinations are ongoing in a number of those
    jurisdictions including, most significantly, in Germany for the
    years 2001 to 2004. During the

quarter ended March 31, 2007, the Company received final
    assessments in Germany for the prior examination period, 1997 to
    2000. The effective settlement of those examinations resulted in
    a reduction to Goodwill of approximately $42 million with a
    net expected cash outlay of $29 million. The Company’s
    US federal income tax returns for 2003 and beyond are open tax
    years not currently under examination. Unrecognized tax benefits
    are not expected to change significantly over the next
    12 months.

The tax provision (benefit) amounts allocated to other
    comprehensive income (loss), net, were $5 million,
    $10 million and $11 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. Of these
    amounts, $5 million, $10 million and $11 million
    were attributable to the pension and postretirement benefits
    component of other comprehensive income (loss), net. The income
    tax provision (benefit) associated with Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net is dependent upon the tax
    jurisdiction in which the items arise and accordingly could
    result in an effective tax rate that is different from the
    overall consolidated effective income tax rate on the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Stock-Based
    and Other Management Compensation Plans

In December 2004, the Company approved a stock incentive plan
    for executive officers, key employees and directors, a deferred
    compensation plan for executive officers and key employees as
    well as other management incentive programs.

The stock incentive plan allows for the issuance or delivery of
    up to 16,250,000 shares of the Company’s Series A
    common stock through the award of stock options, restricted
    stock units (“RSUs”) and other stock-based awards as
    may be approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee of
    the Board of Directors.

Deferred
    Compensation

The 2004 deferred compensation plan provides an aggregate
    maximum amount payable of $196 million. The initial
    component of the deferred compensation plan vested in 2004 and
    was paid in the first quarter of 2005. In May 2007, the Original
    Shareholders sold their remaining equity interest in the Company
    triggering an Exit Event, as defined by the plan. Cash
    compensation of $74 million, representing the
    participants’ 2005 and 2006 contingent benefits, was paid
    to the participants during the year ended December 31,
    2007. Participants continuing in the 2004 deferred compensation
    plan (see below for discussion regarding certain
    participant’s decision to participate in a revised program)
    continue to vest in their 2008 and 2009 time-based and
    performance-based entitlements as defined in the deferred
    compensation plan. During the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded compensation expense
    of $3 million, $84 million and $19 million,
    respectively, associated with this plan. The remaining amount
    payable under the plan is $1 million.

On April 2, 2007, certain participants in the
    Company’s deferred compensation plan elected to participate
    in a revised program, which includes both cash awards and
    restricted stock units (see Restricted Stock Units below). Under
    the revised program, participants relinquished their cash awards
    of up to $30 million that would have contingently accrued
    from

2007-2009

under the original plan. In lieu of these awards, the revised
    deferred compensation program provides for a future cash award
    in an amount equal to 90% of the maximum potential payout under
    the original plan, plus growth pursuant to one of three
    participant-selected notional investment vehicles, as defined in
    the associated agreements. Participants must remain employed
    through 2010 to vest in the new award. The Company will make
    award payments under the revised program in the first quarter of
    2011, unless participants elect to further defer the payment of
    their individual awards. Based on current participation in the
    revised program, the awards aggregate to approximately
    $27 million plus notional earnings and will be recognized
    as expense through December 31, 2010. The Company expensed
    $8 million and $6 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the
    revised program.

In December 2007, the Company adopted a deferred compensation
    plan whereby certain of the Company’s senior employees and
    directors were offered the opportunity to defer a portion of
    their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal
    to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts based upon the
    market-

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

performance of specified measurement funds selected by the
    participant. Participants are required to make deferral
    elections under the plan prior to January 1 of the year
    such deferrals will be withheld from their compensation. The
    Company expensed $1 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 related to this plan.

In December 2008, the Company granted time-vesting cash awards
    of $22 million with the Company’s executive officers
    and certain other key employees. Each award of cash vests 30% on
    October 14, 2009, 30% on October 14, 2010 and 40% on
    October 14, 2011. In its sole discretion, the compensation
    committee of the Board of Directors may at any time convert all
    or a portion of the cash award to an award of time-vesting
    restricted stock units.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan

Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted a long-term
    incentive plan (the “LTIP Plan”) which covers certain
    members of management and other key employees of the Company.
    The LTIP Plan is a three-year cash based plan in which awards
    are based on annual and three-year cumulative targets (as
    defined in the LTIP Plan). In February 2007, $26 million
    was paid to the LTIP plan participants. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded expense of
    $19 million related to the LTIP Plan. There are no
    additional amounts due under the LTIP Plan.

Stock
    Options

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payments

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”), on
    January 1, 2006. The Company elected the modified
    prospective transition method under which compensation costs are
    recognized for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but
    not yet vested as of January 1, 2006 and all stock-based
    payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006.
    Compensation costs are based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R).

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan that makes
    awards of stock options to certain employees. It is the
    Company’s current policy to grant options with an exercise
    price equal to the average of the high and low price of the
    Company’s Series A common stock on the grant date. The
    options issued have a ten-year term and vest on a graded basis
    over periods ranging from one to five years. The estimated value
    of the Company’s stock-based awards less expected
    forfeitures is amortized over the awards’ respective
    vesting period on a straight-line basis.

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the grant
    date using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The weighted
    average assumptions used in the model are outlined in the
    following table:

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on the
    Company’s historical volatilities and volatilities of peer
    companies. When establishing the expected life assumptions, the
    Company reviews annual historical employee exercise behavior of
    option grants with similar vesting periods and the expected life
    assumptions of peer companies. The Company utilizes the review
    of peer companies based on its own lack of extensive history.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options

    was $16.78 and $14.42, respectively, per option. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately
    $12 million of total unrecognized compensation expense
    related to stock options, excluding estimated forfeitures, to be
    recognized over the remaining vesting periods of the options.
    Cash received from stock option exercises was $18 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no tax
    benefit realized from stock option exercises during the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

Restricted
    Stock Units

Performance-based RSUs.

Participants in the
    revised deferred compensation program also received an award of
    RSUs. The RSUs, which were granted in April 2007, cliff vest on
    December 31, 2010 and have a fair value of $23.63 per unit.
    The number of RSUs that ultimately vest depends on market
    performance targets measured by comparison of the Company’s
    stock performance versus a defined peer group. The ultimate
    award will range from zero to 263,030 RSUs, based on the market
    performance measurement at the cliff vesting date. The market
    performance feature is factored into the estimated fair value
    per unit, and compensation expense for the award is based on the
    maximum RSUs of 263,030. Dividends on RSUs are earned in
    accordance with the Company’s common stock dividend policy
    and are reinvested in additional RSUs.

In addition, under the 2007 Long-term Performance Program, the
    Company granted RSUs with a fair value of $21.30 per unit to
    certain employees. The RSUs vest annually in equal tranches
    beginning September 30, 2008 through September 30,
    2011. The RSUs contain the same market performance criteria as
    those described above, with an ultimate award that will range
    from zero to 947,361 RSUs. The awards include a

catch-up

provision that provides for vesting on September 30, 2012
    of previously unvested amounts, subject to certain maximums.
    Dividends on RSUs are earned in accordance with the
    Company’s common stock dividend policy and are reinvested
    in additional RSUs.

In December 2008, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees
    with a fair value of $12.65 per unit. The RSUs vest on
    October 14, 2011. The number of RSUs that ultimately vest
    is dependent upon the achievement of 1) internal
    profitability targets and 2) market performance targets
    measured by the comparison of the Company’s stock
    performance versus a defined peer group. The ultimate award will
    range from zero to 669,150 RSUs. The market performance feature
    is factored into the estimated fair value per unit.

The Company also made a grant in December 2008 of 200,000
    performance units to be settled in cash to the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer. The terms of the performance units are
    substantially similar to the performance-based RSUs granted in
    December 2008. The value of the performance units is equivalent
    to the value of one share of the Company’s Series A
    common stock and any amounts that may vest under the performance
    unit award agreement are to be settled in cash, rather than
    shares of the Company’s Series A common stock. The
    compensation committee of the Board of Directors may elect to
    convert all or any portion of the performance units award to an
    award of an equivalent value of performance-based RSUs.

Fair value for the Company’s performance-based RSUs was
    estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation
    approach. Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to randomly
    generate future stock returns for the Company and each company
    in the designated peer group for each grant based on
    company-specific dividend yields, volatilities and stock return
    correlations. These returns were used to calculate future RSU
    vesting percentages and the simulated values of the vested RSUs
    were then discounted to present value using a risk-free rate,
    yielding the expected value of these RSUs.

The range of assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation
    approach is outlined in the following table:

Time-based RSUs.

During 2007 and 2008, the
    Company granted non-employee Directors time-based RSUs that
    generally vest one year after grant. During 2008, the Company
    granted time-based RSUs to certain employees that vest ratably
    over time intervals ranging from one to four years. The fair
    value of the time-based RSUs was equal to the average of the
    high and low price of the Company’s Series A common
    stock on the grant date.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the Company’s
    variable rate debt, the Company utilizes interest rate swap
    agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate debt to a
    fixed rate obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are
    designated as cash flow hedges. If an interest rate swap
    agreement is terminated prior to its maturity, the amount
    previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net is recognized into earnings over the period that the
    hedged transaction impacts earnings. If the hedging relationship
    is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted
    transaction will not occur according to the original strategy,
    any related amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net are recognized into earnings
    immediately.

CELANESE

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had an interest rate
    swap agreement in place with a notional value of
    $300 million. On March 29, 2007, in connection with
    the April 2007 debt refinancing, the Company terminated this
    interest rate swap agreement and recognized a gain of
    $2 million related to amounts previously recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.

In March 2007, in anticipation of the April 2007 debt
    refinancing, the Company entered into various US dollar and Euro
    interest rate swap agreements, which became effective on
    April 2, 2007, with notional amounts of $1.6 billion
    and €150 million, respectively. The notional amount of
    the $1.6 billion US dollar interest rate swaps decreased by
    $400 million effective January 2, 2008 and decreased
    by another $200 million effective January 2, 2009. To
    offset the declines, the Company entered into US dollar interest
    rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million
    which became effective on January 2, 2008 and an additional
    US dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of
    $200 million which will become effective April 2, 2009.

The Company recognized interest (expense) income from hedging
    activities relating to interest rate swaps of
    ($18) million, $6 million and $1 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    The Company recorded a net loss of less than $1 million to
    Other income (expense), net for the ineffective portion of the
    interest rate swap agreements for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Company recorded an
    unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of $79 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

Certain entities have receivables and payables denominated in
    currencies other than their respective functional currencies,
    which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into
    foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize its exposure to
    foreign currency fluctuations. The currently outstanding foreign
    currency contracts are hedging booked exposure, however the
    Company may from time to time hedge its currency exposure
    related to forecasted transactions. Forward contracts are not
    designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133.

The following table indicates the total US dollar equivalents of
    net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign
    exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency. All of the
    contracts included in the table below will have approximately
    offsetting effects from actual underlying payables, receivables,
    intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to
    foreign exchange remeasurement.

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in

    term loan were designated as a hedge of a net investment of a
    foreign operation. The Company dedesignated the net investment
    hedge due to the debt refinancing in April 2007 and redesignated

    As a result, the Company recorded $26 million of
    mark-to-market losses related to the cross currency swaps and
    the new senior Euro term loan during this period.

Under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, the
    Company paid approximately €13 million in interest and
    received approximately $16 million in interest on June 15
    and December 15 of each year. The fair value of the net
    obligation under the cross currency swaps was included in
    current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as
    of December 31, 2007. Upon maturity of the cross currency
    swap agreements in June 2008, the Company owed
    €276 million ($426 million) and was owed
    $333 million. In settlement of the obligation, the Company
    paid $93 million (net of interest of $3 million) in
    June 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    dedesignated €385 million of the €400
    Euro-denominated portion of the term loan, previously designated
    as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation. Prior to
    this dedesignation, the Company had been using external
    derivative contracts to offset foreign currency exposures on
    intercompany loans. The foreign currency exposure resulting from
    dedesignation of €385 million of the hedge of a net
    investment of a foreign operation is expected to offset the
    foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans,
    decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and
    reducing the Company’s exposure to external counterparties.
    The remaining €15 million Euro-denominated portion of
    the term loan continues to be designated as a hedge of a net
    investment of a foreign operation.

The effective portion of the gain (loss) on the derivative
    (cross currency swaps) is recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the amount charged to
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net was
    $(19) million, $(19) million and $(23) million,
    respectively. The gain (loss) related to items excluded from the
    assessment of hedge effectiveness of the cross currency swaps
    are recorded to Other income (expense), net in the consolidated
    statements of operations. For the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, the amount charged to Other income
    (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations was
    $1 million, $(6) million and $5 million,
    respectively.

Commodity
    Risk Management

The Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its
    procurement of certain raw materials. The Company manages its
    exposure primarily through the use of long-term supply
    agreements and derivative instruments. The Company regularly
    assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity
    requirements forward and utilization of other raw material
    hedging instruments, in addition to forward purchase contracts,
    in accordance with changes in market conditions. Forward
    purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally
    settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity. For
    qualifying contracts, the Company has elected to apply the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception of
    SFAS No. 133, as amended, as it was probable at the
    inception and throughout the term of the contract that they
    would not settle net and would result in physical delivery. As
    such, realized gains and losses on these contracts are included
    in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

In addition, the Company occasionally enters into financial
    derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy
    source. Typically, these types of transactions do not qualify
    for hedge accounting. These instruments are marked to market at
    each reporting period and gains (losses) are included in Cost of
    sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company
    recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during
    the year ended December 31, 2008 and less than
    $1 million during each of the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company did not have any open financial derivative contracts for
    commodities.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted certain provisions
    of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008.
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tiered fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used
    in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are
    defined as follows:

Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company

F-47


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Level 2 — inputs that are observable in the
    marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1

Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable in the
    marketplace and significant to the valuation

SFAS No. 157 requires the Company to maximize the use
    of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
    inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in
    different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be
    categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is
    significant to the fair value calculation.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured
    at fair value on a recurring basis and include securities
    available for sale and derivative financial instruments.
    Securities available for sale include US government and
    corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and equity
    securities. Derivative financial instruments include interest
    rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps.

Marketable Securities.

Where possible, the
    Company utilizes quoted prices in active markets to measure debt
    and equity securities; such items are classified as Level 1
    in the hierarchy and include equity securities and US government
    bonds. When quoted market prices for identical assets are
    unavailable, varying valuation techniques are used. Common
    inputs in valuing these assets include, among others, benchmark
    yields, issuer spreads, forward mortgage-backed securities trade
    prices and recently reported trades. Such assets are classified
    as Level 2 in the hierarchy and typically include
    mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and other US
    government securities.

Derivatives.

Derivative financial instruments
    are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques.
    These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2
    inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange
    rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash
    flow calculation considering the instrument’s term,
    notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant
    inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps and
    foreign currency forwards and swaps are observable in the active
    markets and are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy.

The following fair value hierarchy table presents information
    about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair

In general, the cost investments included in the table above are

    determinable; however, the Company believes the carrying values
    approximate or are less than the fair values.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair values of cash
    and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payables, short-term
    debt and the current installments of long-term debt approximate
    carrying values due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. These items have been excluded from the table.
    Additionally, certain noncurrent receivables, principally
    insurance recoverables, are carried at net realizable value.

The fair value of long-term debt and debt-related financial
    instruments is based upon valuations from third-party banks and
    market quotations.

23.  Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of
    business, relating to such matters as product liability,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices and release of
    chemicals into the environment. While it is impossible at this
    time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these
    proceedings, lawsuits and claims, the Company is actively
    defending those matters where the Company is named as a
    defendant. Additionally, the Company believes it has determined
    its best estimate, based on the advice of legal counsel, that
    adequate reserves have been made and that the ultimate outcomes
    will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
    position of the Company; however, the ultimate outcome of any
    given matter may have a material impact on the results of
    operations or cash flows of the Company in any given reporting
    period.

Plumbing
    Actions

CNA Holdings, Inc. (“CNA Holdings”), a US subsidiary
    of the Company, which included the US business now conducted by
    the Ticona business which is included in the Advanced Engineered
    Materials segment, along with Shell Oil Company
    (“Shell”), E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company
    (“DuPont”) and others, has been a defendant in a
    series of lawsuits, including a number of class actions,
    alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were
    utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential
    property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail.
    Based on, among other things, the findings of outside experts
    and the successful use of Ticona’s acetal copolymer in
    similar applications, CNA Holdings does not believe
    Ticona’s acetal copolymer was defective or caused the
    plumbing systems to fail. In many cases CNA Holdings’
    potential future exposure may be limited by invocation of the
    statute of limitations since CNA Holdings ceased selling the
    resin for use in the plumbing systems in site-built homes during
    1986 and in manufactured homes during 1990.

In November 1995, CNA Holdings, DuPont and Shell entered into
    national class action settlements which called for the
    replacement of plumbing systems of claimants who have had
    qualifying leaks, as well as reimbursements for certain leak
    damage. In connection with such settlement, the three companies
    had agreed to fund these replacements and reimbursements up to
    an aggregate amount of $950 million. As of
    December 31,

2008, the aggregate funding is $1,103 million, due to
    additional contributions and funding commitments made primarily
    by other parties.

During the period between 1995 and 2001, CNA Holdings was also
    named as a defendant in the following putative class actions:

•

In addition, between 1994 and 2008 CNA Holdings was named as a
    defendant in numerous non-class actions filed in Arizona,
    Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee
    and Texas, the US Virgin Islands and Canada of which ten are
    currently pending. In all of these actions, the plaintiffs have
    sought recovery for alleged damages caused by leaking
    polybutylene plumbing. Damage amounts have generally not been
    specified but these cases generally do not involve (either
    individually or in the aggregate) a large number of homes.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had remaining accruals
    of $64 million, of which $2 million is included in
    current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As
    of December 31, 2007, the Company had remaining accruals of
    $65 million, of which $3 million was included in
    current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company reached settlements with CNA Holdings’ insurers
    specifying their responsibility for these claims. During the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the Company received $23
    million of insurance proceeds from various CNA Holdings’
    insurers as full satisfaction for their responsibility for these
    claims.

Plumbing
    Insurance Indemnifications

Celanese GmbH entered into agreements with insurance companies
    related to product liability settlements associated with
    Celcon

plumbing claims. These agreements, except those with insolvent
    insurance companies, require the Company to indemnify

and/or

defend these insurance companies in the event that third parties
    seek additional monies for matters released in these agreements.
    The indemnifications in these agreements do not provide for time
    limitations.

In certain of the agreements, Celanese GmbH received a fixed
    settlement amount. The indemnities under these agreements
    generally are limited to, but in some cases are greater than,
    the amount received in settlement from the insurance company.
    The maximum exposure under these indemnifications is
    $95 million. Other settlement agreements have no stated
    limits.

There are other agreements whereby the settling insurer agreed
    to pay a fixed percentage of claims that relate to that
    insurer’s policies. The Company has provided
    indemnifications to the insurers for amounts paid in excess of
    the settlement percentage. These indemnifications do not provide
    for monetary or time limitations.

Sorbates
    Antitrust Actions

In May 2002, the European Commission informed Hoechst AG
    (“Hoechst”) of its intent to officially investigate
    the sorbates industry. In early January 2003, the European
    Commission served Hoechst, Nutrinova, Inc., a US subsidiary of
    Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients
    GmbH and previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoechst
    (“Nutrinova”), and a number of competitors of
    Nutrinova with a statement of objections alleging unlawful,
    anticompetitive behavior affecting the European sorbates market.
    In October 2003, the European Commission ruled that Hoechst,
    Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd.
    (“Daicel”), The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co.
    Ltd. and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd. operated a cartel in
    the European sorbates market between 1979 and 1996. The European
    Commission imposed a total fine of €138 million on
    such companies, of which €99 million was assessed
    against Hoechst and its legal successors. The case against
    Nutrinova was closed. Pursuant to the Demerger Agreement with
    Hoechst, Celanese GmbH was assigned the obligation related to
    the sorbates antitrust matter; however, Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, agreed to indemnify Celanese GmbH for 80% of any
    costs Celanese GmbH incurred relative to this matter.
    Accordingly, Celanese GmbH recognized a receivable from Hoechst
    from this indemnification. In June 2008, the Court of First
    Instance of the European Communities (Fifth Chamber) reduced the
    fine against Hoechst to €74.25 million and in July
    2008, Hoechst paid the €74.25 million fine. In August
    2008, the Company paid Hoechst €17 million, including
    interest of €2 million, in satisfaction of its 20%
    obligation with respect to the fine.

Based on the advice of external counsel and a review of the
    existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates
    antitrust matters, including the settlement of the European
    Union’s investigation, as well as civil claims filed and
    settled, the Company released its accruals related to the
    settled sorbates antitrust matters and the indemnification
    receivables resulting in a gain of $8 million, net,
    included in Other (charges) gains, net, in the consolidated
    statements of operations. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company had indemnification receivables of $137 million
    included in current Other assets and accruals of
    $170 million included in current Other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, in 2004 a civil antitrust action styled

Freeman
    Industries LLC v. Eastman Chemical Co., et. al.

was
    filed against Hoechst and Nutrinova, Inc. in the Law Court for
    Sullivan County in Kingsport, Tennessee. The plaintiff sought
    monetary damages and other relief for alleged conduct involving
    the sorbates industry. The trial court dismissed the
    plaintiff’s claims and upon appeal the Supreme Court of
    Tennessee affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims.
    In December 2005, the plaintiff lost an attempt to amend its
    complaint and the entire action was dismissed with prejudice by
    the trial court. Plaintiff’s counsel has subsequently filed
    a new complaint with new class representatives in the District
    Court of the District of Tennessee. The Company’s motion to
    strike the class allegations was granted in April 2008 and the
    plaintiff’s appeal of such ruling is currently pending.

Acetic
    Acid Patent Infringement Matters

On May 9, 1999, Celanese International Corporation filed a
    private criminal action styled

Celanese International
    Corporation v. China Petrochemical Development Corporation

against China Petrochemical Development Corporation
    (“CPDC”) in the Taiwan Kaoshiung District Court
    alleging that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s patent covering the manufacture of acetic
    acid. Celanese International Corporation also filed a
    supplementary civil brief which, in view of changes in Taiwanese
    patent laws, was subsequently converted to a civil action
    alleging damages against CPDC based on a period of infringement
    of ten years,

1991-2000,

and based on CPDC’s own data which was reported to the
    Taiwanese securities and exchange commission. Celanese
    International Corporation’s patent was held valid by the
    Taiwanese patent office. On August 31, 2005, the District
    Court held that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s acetic acid patent and awarded Celanese
    International Corporation approximately $28 million (plus
    interest) for the period of 1995 through 1999. In October 2008,
    the High Court, on appeal, reversed the District Court’s
    $28 million award to the Company. The Company is appealing. On
    January 16, 2006, the District Court

F-51

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

awarded Celanese International Corporation $800,000 (plus
    interest) for the year 1990. In January 2009, the High
    Court, on appeal, affirmed the District Court’s award and
    CPDC appealed on February 5, 2009. On June 29, 2007,
    the District Court awarded Celanese International Corporation
    $60 million (plus interest) for the period of 2000 through
    2005. CPDC is appealing this award.

Domination
    Agreement

On October 1, 2004, a Domination Agreement between Celanese
    GmbH and the Purchaser became operative. When the Domination
    Agreement became operative, the Purchaser became obligated to
    offer to acquire all outstanding Celanese GmbH shares from the
    minority shareholders of Celanese GmbH in return for payment of
    fair cash compensation. The amount of this fair cash
    compensation was determined to be €41.92 per share, plus
    interest, in accordance with applicable German law. Until the
    Squeeze-Out was registered in the commercial register in Germany
    on December 22, 2006, any minority shareholder who elected
    not to sell its shares to the Purchaser was entitled to remain a
    shareholder of Celanese GmbH and to receive from the Purchaser a
    gross guaranteed annual payment on its shares of €3.27 per
    Celanese GmbH share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any
    dividend. For the year ended December 31, 2006, a charge of
    €3 million ($4 million) was recorded to Other
    income (expense), net for the anticipated guaranteed annual
    payment.

On June 1, 2006, the guaranteed annual payment for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, which amounted to
    €3 million, was paid. In addition, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement entered into with plaintiff shareholders in
    March 2006, the Purchaser paid €1 million on
    June 30, 2006, the guaranteed annual payment for the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2006, to those shareholders who
    signed a letter waiving any further rights with respect to such
    guaranteed annual payment that ordinarily would become due and
    payable after the 2007 annual general meeting. Between
    June 30, 2006, and January 17, 2007, the Purchaser
    paid a total amount of less than €1 million to
    minority shareholders who required early payment of the
    guaranteed annual payment for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2006, by submitting such waiver letter after
    June 30, 2006.

On January 17, 2007, the Purchaser made, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement entered into with plaintiff shareholders in
    December 2006, the following guaranteed annual payments:
    (i) a total amount of €1 million was paid to all
    minority shareholders who had not yet requested early payment of
    the guaranteed annual payment for the fiscal year ended on
    September 30, 2006, and (ii) a total amount of
    €1 million representing the pro rata share of the
    guaranteed annual payment for the first five months of the
    fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 was paid to all
    minority shareholders.

The Domination Agreement cannot be terminated by the Purchaser
    in the ordinary course of business until September 30,
    2009. The Company’s subsidiaries, Celanese International
    Holdings Luxembourg S.à r.l. (“CIH”), formerly
    Celanese Caylux Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A., and Celanese US,
    have each agreed to provide the Purchaser with financing to
    strengthen the Purchaser’s ability to fulfill its
    obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
    Agreement and to ensure that the Purchaser will perform all of
    its obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
    Agreement when such obligations become due, including, without
    limitation, the obligation to compensate Celanese GmbH for any
    statutory annual loss incurred by Celanese GmbH during the term
    of the Domination Agreement. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under such guarantees
    or other security to the Purchaser, the Company may not have
    sufficient funds for payments on its indebtedness when due. The
    Company has not had to compensate Celanese GmbH for an annual
    loss for any period during which the Domination Agreement has
    been in effect.

The amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement are under
    court review in special award proceedings. As a result of these
    proceedings, either amount could be increased by the court so
    that all former Celanese GmbH shareholders, including those who
    have already tendered their shares into the mandatory offer and
    have received the fair cash compensation could claim the
    respective higher amounts. Certain former Celanese GmbH
    shareholders may initiate such proceedings also with respect to
    the Squeeze-Out compensation. In this case, former Celanese GmbH
    shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of Celanese

F-52


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

GmbH due to the Squeeze-Out are entitled, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement between the Purchaser and certain former
    Celanese GmbH shareholders, to claim for their shares the higher
    of the compensation amounts determined by the court in these
    different proceedings. Payments these shareholders already
    received as compensation for their shares will be offset so that
    those shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of Celanese
    GmbH due to the Squeeze-Out are not entitled to more than the
    higher of the amount set in the two court proceedings.

Shareholder
    Litigation

The amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement may be
    increased in special award proceedings initiated by minority
    shareholders, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser
    can otherwise make available to the Company. As of
    March 30, 2005, several minority shareholders of Celanese
    GmbH had initiated special award proceedings seeking the
    court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation
    and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the
    Domination Agreement. As a result of these proceedings, the
    amount of the fair cash consideration and the guaranteed annual
    payment offered under the Domination Agreement could be
    increased by the court so that all minority shareholders,
    including those who have already tendered their shares into the
    mandatory offer and have received the fair cash compensation
    could claim the respective higher amounts. The court dismissed
    all of these proceedings in March 2005 on the grounds of
    inadmissibility. Thirty-three plaintiffs appealed the dismissal,
    and in January 2006, twenty-three of these appeals were
    granted by the court. They were remanded back to the court of
    first instance, where the valuation will be further reviewed. On
    December 12, 2006, the court of first instance appointed an
    expert to help determine the value of Celanese GmbH. In the
    first quarter of 2007, certain minority shareholders that
    received €66.99 per share as fair cash compensation also
    filed award proceedings challenging the amount they received as
    fair cash compensation.

As a result of the special proceedings discussed above, amounts
    paid as fair cash compensation to certain minority shareholders
    of Celanese GmbH could be increased by the court such that
    minority shareholders could be awarded amounts in excess of the
    fair cash compensation they have previously received.

The Company received applications for the commencement of award
    proceedings filed by 79 shareholders against the Purchaser
    with the Frankfurt District Court requesting the court to set a
    higher amount for the Squeeze-Out compensation. The motions are
    based on various alleged shortcomings and mistakes in the
    valuation of Celanese GmbH done for purposes of the Squeeze-Out.
    On May 11, 2007, the court of first instance appointed a
    common representative for those shareholders that have not filed
    an application on their own.

    Corporation (“HCC”), Celanese Americas Corporation and
    Celanese GmbH (collectively, the “Celanese Entities”)
    and Hoechst, the former parent of HCC, were named as defendants
    in two actions (involving 25 individual participants) filed in
    September 2006 by US purchasers of polyester staple fibers
    manufactured and sold by HCC. The actions allege that the
    defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids
    and allocate customers of polyester staple sold in the United
    States. These actions were consolidated in a proceeding by a
    Multi-District Litigation Panel in the United States District
    Court for the Western District of North Carolina styled

In re
    Polyester Staple Antitrust Litigation

, MDL 1516. On
    June 12, 2008 the court dismissed these actions against all
    Celanese Entities in consideration of a payment by the Company
    of $107 million. This proceeding related to sales by the
    polyester staple fibers business which Hoechst AG sold to KoSa,
    Inc. in 1998. Accordingly, the impact of this settlement is
    reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations. The Company also previously entered
    into tolling arrangements with four other alleged US purchasers
    of polyester staple fibers manufactured and sold by the Celanese
    Entities. These purchasers were not included in the settlement
    and one such company filed suit against the Company in December
    2008 in the Western District of North Carolina entitled

Milliken & Company v. CNA Holdings, Inc., Celanese
    Americas Corporation and Hoechst AG

(No. 8-CV-00578).

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 1998, HCC sold its polyester staple business as part of the
    sale of its Film & Fibers Division to KoSa B.V., f/k/a
    Arteva B.V. and a subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc.
    (“KoSa”). In March 2001 the US Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) commenced an investigation of possible price
    fixing regarding the sales of polyester staple fibers in the US
    subsequent to the period the Celanese Entities were engaged in
    the polyester staple fiber business. The Celanese Entities were
    never named in these DOJ actions. As a result of the DOJ action,
    during August of 2002, Arteva Specialties, S.a.r.l., a
    subsidiary of KoSa, (“Arteva Specialties”) pled guilty
    to criminal violation of the Sherman Act related to
    anti-competitive conduct occurring after the 1998 sale of the
    polyester staple fiber business and paid a fine of
    $29 million. In a complaint pending against the Celanese
    Entities and Hoechst in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of New York, Koch Industries, Inc., KoSa,
    Arteva Specialties and Arteva Services S.a.r.l. seek damages in
    excess of $371 million which includes indemnification for
    all damages related to the defendants’ alleged
    participation in, and failure to disclose, the alleged
    conspiracy.

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties
    for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of
    agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements,
    leases, settlement agreements and various agreements with
    affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, others do not provide such limitations.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the occurrence of
    unpredictable future events, the future costs associated with
    them cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably
    estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims
    that have been brought to its attention. These known obligations
    include the following:

•
    Demerger Obligations

The Company has obligations to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, for various liabilities under the Demerger
    Agreement, including for environmental liabilities associated
    with contamination arising under 19 divestiture agreements
    entered into by Hoechst prior to the demerger.

The Company’s obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, is subject to the following thresholds:

•

The Company will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors,
    against those liabilities up to €250 million;

•

Hoechst, and its legal successors, will bear those liabilities
    exceeding €250 million, however the Company will
    reimburse Hoechst, and its legal successors, for one-third of
    those liabilities for amounts that exceed €750 million
    in the aggregate.

The aggregate maximum amount of environmental indemnifications
    under the remaining divestiture agreements that provide for
    monetary limits is approximately €750 million. Three
    of the divestiture agreements do not provide for monetary limits.

Based on the estimate of the probability of loss under this
    indemnification, the Company had reserves of $27 million
    and $27 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, for this contingency. Where the Company is unable
    to reasonably determine the probability of loss or estimate such
    loss under an indemnification, the Company has not recognized
    any related liabilities.

The Company has also undertaken in the Demerger Agreement to
    indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for liabilities that
    Hoechst is required to discharge, including tax liabilities,
    which are associated with businesses that were included in the
    demerger but were not demerged due to legal restrictions on the
    transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for
    any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not provided
    for any reserves associated with this indemnification as it is
    not probable or estimable. The Company has not made any

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

payments to Hoechst or its legal successors during the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in
    connection with this indemnification.

•
    Divestiture Obligations

The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify
    third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for
    various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also
    include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust
    and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees
    represent standard contractual terms associated with typical
    divestiture agreements and, other than environmental
    liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the
    Company to any significant risk.

The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and
    facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or
    guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, ranging from one year to thirty years. The
    aggregate amount of guarantees provided for under these
    agreements is approximately $2.3 billion as of
    December 31, 2008. Other agreements do not provide for any
    monetary or time limitations.

Based on historical claims experience and its knowledge of the
    sites and businesses involved, the Company believes that it is
    adequately reserved for these matters. As of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the Company has reserves in the aggregate of
    $33 million and $27 million, respectively, for these
    matters.

•
    Other Obligations

The Company is secondarily liable under a lease agreement that
    the Company assigned to a third party. The lease expires on
    April 30, 2012. The lease liability for the period from
    January 1, 2009 to April 30, 2012 is estimated to be
    approximately $26 million.

The Company has agreed to indemnify various insurance carriers
    for amounts not in excess of the settlements received from
    claims made against these carriers subsequent to the settlement.
    The aggregate amount of guarantees under these settlements which
    is limited in term is approximately $10 million.

Asbestos
    Claims

As of December 31, 2008, Celanese Ltd. and/or CNA Holdings,
    Inc., both US subsidiaries of the Company, are defendants in
    approximately 559 asbestos cases. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, 66 new cases were filed against the
    Company, 137 cases were resolved, and 4 cases were added after
    further analysis by outside counsel. Because many of these cases
    involve numerous plaintiffs, the Company is subject to claims
    significantly in excess of the number of actual cases. The
    Company has reserves for defense costs related to claims arising
    from these matters. The Company believes that there is no
    significant exposure related to these matters.

Purchase
    Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    commitments to purchase goods and services over a fixed period
    of time. The Company maintains a number of
    “take-or-pay” contracts for purchases of raw materials
    and utilities. As of December 31, 2008, there were
    outstanding future commitments of $2,291 million under
    take-or-pay contracts. The Company does not expect to incur any
    losses under these contractual arrangements and historically has
    not incurred any material losses related to these contracts.
    Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, there were
    outstanding commitments relating to capital projects of
    $33 million.

Ticona
    Kelsterbach Plant Relocation

On November 29, 2006, the Company reached a settlement with
    the Frankfurt, Germany, Airport (“Fraport”) to
    relocate its Kelsterbach, Germany, business, resolving several
    years of legal disputes related to the planned Frankfurt airport
    expansion. The final settlement agreement was approved by the
    Fraport supervisory board on May 8, 2007 at an
    extraordinary board meeting. The final settlement agreement was
    signed on June 12, 2007. In July 2007, the Company
    announced that it would relocate the Kelsterbach, Germany,
    business to the Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine Main area
    by mid-2011. Over a five-year period, Fraport will pay Ticona a
    total of €670 million to

offset the costs associated with the transition of the business
    from its current location and the closure of the Kelsterbach
    plant. The payment amount was increased by €20 million
    to €670 million in consideration of the Company’s
    agreement to waive certain obligations of Fraport set forth in
    the settlement agreement. In June 2008, the Company received
    €200 million ($311 million) from Fraport under
    this agreement. Amounts received from Fraport are accounted for
    as deferred proceeds and are included in noncurrent Other
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 30

Insurance
    Recoveries

In May 2007, the Company announced that it had an unplanned
    outage at its Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid facility. At that
    time, the Company originally expected the outage to last until
    the end of May. Upon restart of the facility, additional
    operating issues were identified which necessitated an extension
    of the outage for further, more extensive repairs. In July 2007,
    the Company announced that the further repairs were unsuccessful
    on restart of the unit. All repairs were completed in early
    August 2007 and normal production capacity resumed. During the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    recorded $38 million and $40 million, respectively, of
    insurance recoveries from its reinsurers in partial satisfaction
    of claims that the Company made based on losses resulting from
    the outage. These insurances recoveries are included in Other
    (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of
    operations (Note 18).

In October 2008, the Company declared force majeure on its
    specialty polymers products produced at its AT Plastics facility
    in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada as a result of certain events and
    subsequent cessation of production. The Company intends to
    replace damaged long-lived assets. Any contingent liabilities
    associated with the outage may be mitigated by the
    Company’s insurance policies.

Subsequent
    Events

On January 5, 2009, the Company declared a cash dividend of
    $0.265625 per share on its 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred
    stock amounting to $3 million and a cash dividend of $0.04
    per share on its Series A common stock amounting to
    $6 million. Both cash dividends are for the period
    November 1, 2008 to January 31, 2009 and were paid on
    February 1, 2009 to holders of record as of
    January 15, 2009.

On February 2, 2009, the Company announced the Fraport
    supervisory board approved the acceleration of the 2009 and 2010
    payments of €200 million and €140 million,
    respectively, required by the settlement agreement signed in
    June 2007. On February 5, 2009, the Company received a
    discounted amount of approximately €322 million, excluding
    value-added tax of €59 million.

On February 12, 2009, the Company announced it will shut
    down its VAM production unit in Cangrejera, Mexico and cease VAM
    production at Cangrejera effective the end of February 2009. The
    Company believes this capacity reduction is necessitated by the
    significant change in the global economic environment, the cost
    structure of its VAM unit operations in Cangrejera and
    anticipated lower demand. The Company recorded an impairment
    loss as it relates to the Cangrejera VAM production unit of
    $4 million for the three months ended December 31,
    2008.
