TABLE OF
CONTENTS


Basis of Presentation

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term
"Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the
"Company," "we,"
"our" and "us"
refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The
term "BCP Crystal" refers to our subsidiary
BCP Crystal US Holdings Corp., and not its subsidiaries. The term
"Purchaser" refers to our subsidiary,
Celanese Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known as BCP
Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG, a German limited partnership
(

Kommanditgesellschaft, KG

), and not its subsidiaries, except
where otherwise indicated. The term "Original
Shareholders" refers, collectively, to Blackstone Capital
Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 1, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 2,
Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 3 and BA Capital Investors
Sidecar Fund, L.P. The terms "Sponsor" and
"Advisor" refer to certain affiliates of The
Blackstone Group.

Celanese is a recently-formed company which
does not have any independent external operations other than through
the indirect ownership of Celanese AG and Celanese Americas
Corporation, their consolidated subsidiaries, their non-consolidated
subsidiaries, ventures and other investments. For accounting purposes,
Celanese and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to as the
"Successor." See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements (as defined below) for additional information on
the basis of presentation and accounting policies of the Successor.

In October 2004, Celanese and certain of its subsidiaries completed
an organizational restructuring (the
"Restructuring") pursuant to which the
Purchaser effected, by giving a corresponding instruction under the
Domination Agreement (as defined in "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Basis of Presentation – Impact of the
Acquisition of Celanese AG"), the transfer of all of the
shares of Celanese Americas Corporation
("CAC") from Celanese Holding GmbH, a wholly
owned subsidiary of CAG, to BCP Caylux Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A.
("BCP Caylux") owning 100% of the
equity of CAC and indirectly, all of its assets, including subsidiary
stock. Thereafter, BCP Caylux transferred certain assets, including its
equity ownership interest in CAC to BCP Crystal.

Celanese AG is
incorporated as a stock corporation (

Aktiengesellschaft

, AG)
organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. As used in
this document, the term "CAG" refers to (i)
prior to the Restructuring, Celanese AG and Celanese Americas
Corporation, their consolidated subsidiaries, their non-consolidated
subsidiaries, ventures and other investments, and (ii) following the
Restructuring, Celanese AG, its consolidated subsidiaries, its
non-consolidated subsidiaries, ventures and other investments, except
that with respect to shareholder and similar matters where the context
indicates, "CAG" refers to Celanese AG. For
accounting purposes, "Predecessor" refers to
CAG and its subsidiaries.

As of the date of this Annual Report,
we have two classes of common stock, Series A common stock and Series B
common stock, and convertible perpetual preferred stock. In January
2005, Celanese completed an initial public offering of 50,000,000
shares of Series A common stock. The Series A common stock is currently
held by public shareholders, the Original Shareholders and certain
directors, officers and employees of the Company. All of the Series B
common stock is held by the Original Shareholders. Except for (i) a
special Series B common stock dividend which we paid to the holders of
outstanding shares of Series B common stock on March 9, 2005 and a
special cash dividend to be paid to the holders of outstanding shares
of Series B common stock on April 7, 2005, in each case as described
under "Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities – Dividend Policy", (ii) the
convertibility of Series B common stock into Series A common stock and
(iii) the right of the Series B common stock to consent to any changes
to our governing documents that would adversely affect the Series B
common stock, shares of Series A common stock and shares of Series B
common stock are identical, including with respect to voting rights.
The Series B common stock will automatically convert into Series A
common stock upon payment of the special Series B common stock cash
dividend and may also be converted into Series A common stock at any
time at the option of the holder. As used in this Annual Report, the
term "common stock" means, collectively, the
Series A common stock and the Series B common stock, and the term
"preferred stock" means the convertible
perpetual preferred stock, in each case unless otherwise specified.


Concurrently with the initial public
offering of its Series A common stock, Celanese offered 9,600,000
shares of its preferred stock. Holders of the preferred stock are
entitled to receive, when, as and if, declared by the Celanese board of
directors, out of funds legally available therefore, cash dividends at
the rate of 4.25% per annum of liquidation preference, payable
quarterly in arrears, commencing on May 1, 2005. Dividends on the
preferred stock are cumulative from the date of initial issuance. The
preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any
time, into shares of our Series A common stock at a conversion rate of
1.25 shares of Series A common stock for each share of preferred stock,
subject to adjustments.

Pursuant to a voluntary tender offer
commenced in February 2004 (the "Tender
Offer"), the Purchaser, an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Celanese, in April 2004 acquired approximately 84%
of the ordinary shares of CAG (the "CAG
Shares") outstanding. All references in this document to
the outstanding ordinary shares of CAG exclude treasury shares. As of

December 31,

2004, Celanese's indirect ownership of
approximately 84% of the outstanding CAG Shares would equate to
approximately 84% of the issued CAG Shares (excluding treasury
shares). Pursuant to a mandatory offer commenced in September 2004, the
Purchaser acquired additional CAG Shares. As a result of these
acquisitions, partially offset by the issuance of additional shares of
CAG as a result of the exercise of options issued under the CAG stock
option plan, as of March  23, 2005, we own approximately
85% of the outstanding CAG Shares.

Following the transfer
of CAC to BCP Crystal, (1) BCP Crystal Holdings Ltd. 2 contributed
substantially all of its assets and liabilities (including all
outstanding capital stock of BCP Caylux) to BCP Crystal and (2) BCP
Crystal assumed certain obligations of BCP Caylux, including all rights
and obligations of BCP Caylux under the senior credit facilities, the
floating rate term loan and the notes. BCP Crystal Holdings Ltd. 2
reorganized as a Delaware limited liability company and changed its
name to Celanese Holdings LLC. Blackstone Crystal Holdings Capital
Partners (Cayman) IV Ltd. reorganized as a Delaware corporation and
changed its name to Celanese Corporation. BCP Crystal, at its
discretion, may subsequently cause the liquidation of BCP Caylux.

As a result of these transactions, BCP Crystal holds 100% of
CAC's equity and, indirectly, all equity owned by CAC in its
subsidiaries. In addition, BCP Crystal holds, indirectly, all of the
outstanding common stock of CAG held by the Purchaser and all of the
wholly owned subsidiaries of Celanese that guarantee BCP Caylux's
obligations under the senior credit facilities and guarantee the senior
subordinated notes issued on June 8, 2004 and July 1, 2004 on an
unsecured senior subordinated basis. See Notes 1 and 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements (as defined below).

The term
"Concurrent Financings" refers, collectively,
to the offering our Series A common stock, the offering of our
preferred stock, the entering into of our amended and restated senior
credit facilities and the use of proceeds therefrom in each case. See
"Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related
Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Use
of Proceeds." The term
"Transactions" refers, collectively, to the
Tender Offer, the borrowing of the original $608 million term loan and
the $1,565 million senior subordinated bridge loan facilities on April
6, 2004, the June and July 2004 repayment of the senior subordinated
bridge loan facilities and the borrowing of the $350 million floating
rate term loan and the $1,225 million and €200 million of
senior subordinated notes (such June and July 2004 repayment and
borrowings, the "Refinancing") and the
issuance in September 2004 of $853 million aggregate principal amount
at maturity (with $513 million in gross proceeds) of senior discount
notes. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations –
Liquidity".

The consolidated financial statements
of the Successor for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, and the
consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor for the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and for each of the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002 contained in this document (collectively, the
"Consolidated Financial Statements") were
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for all

Aktiengesellschaft, also referred to as
"Hoechst" in this document, in a demerger
that became effective on October 22, 1999,


adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures.
The Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information
included in this document, unless otherwise specified, have been
presented to separately show the effects of discontinued
operations.

CAG is a foreign private issuer and previously filed
its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and 2002
in its Annual Report on Form 20-F. CAG changed its fiscal year to end
on September 30 and also filed its consolidated financial statements as
of September 30, 2004 and for the nine months then ended in its 2004
Annual Report on Form 20-F. In accordance with German law, the
reporting currency of the CAG consolidated financial statements is the
euro. As a result of the Purchaser's acquisition of voting
control of CAG, the financial statements of CAG contained in this
document are reported in U.S. dollars to be consistent with our
reporting requirements. For CAG's reporting requirements, the
euro continues to be the reporting currency.

In the preparation
of other information included in this document, euro amounts have been
translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable historical rate in
effect on the date of the relevant event/period. For purposes of
prospective information, euro amounts have been translated into U.S.
dollars using the rate in effect on December 31, 2004. Our inclusion of
this information is not meant to suggest that the euro amounts actually
represent such dollar amounts or that such amounts could have been
converted into U.S. dollars at any particular rate, if at all.

Item
1.

Business

Celanese Corporation

We are
an integrated global producer of value-added industrial chemicals and
have #1 or #2 market positions worldwide in products comprising the
majority of our sales. We are also the world's largest producer
of acetyl products, including acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer (VAM)
and polyacetal products (POM) and a leading global producer of
high-performance engineered polymers used in consumer and industrial
products and designed to meet highly technical customer requirements.
Our operations are located in North America, Europe and Asia. In
addition, we have substantial ventures primarily in Asia. We believe we
are one of the lowest-cost producers of key building block chemicals in
the acetyls chain, such as acetic acid and VAM, due to our economies of
scale, operating efficiencies and proprietary production
technologies.

We have a large and diverse global customer base
consisting principally of major companies in a broad array of
industries. For the three months ended March 31, 2004 approximately
46% of our net sales by the Predecessor was to customers located
in North America, approximately 42% to customers in Europe and
approximately 12% to customers in Asia, Australia and the rest
of the world. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
approximately 47% of our net sales by the Successor was to
customers located in North America, approximately 40% to
customers in Europe and approximately 13% to customers in Asia,
Australia and the rest of the world.

Segment Overview

We operate through four business segments: Chemical Products,
Technical Polymers Ticona, Acetate Products and Performance Products.
The table below illustrates each segment's net sales to external
customers for the three months ended March 31, 2004, by the Predecessor
and for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, by the Successor, as
well as each segment's major products and end use
markets.

(1)

Net
sales of $1,243 million for the Predecessor for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 and $3,826 million for the Successor for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004, also include $11 million and $45 million in
net sales from Other Activities, respectively, primarily attributable
to our captive insurance companies. 2004 net sales of Chemical Products
excludes inter-segment sales of $29 million with respect to the
Predecessor for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and $82 million
with respect to the Successor for the nine months ended December 31,
2004.

(2)

In October 2004, we announced
our plans to discontinue filament production by mid-2005 and to
consolidate our flake and tow production at three sites, instead of the
current five.


Chemical Products

Our
Chemical Products segment produces and supplies acetyl products,
including acetic acid, acetate esters, vinyl acetate monomer, polyvinyl
alcohol and emulsions. We are a leading global producer of acetic acid,
the world's largest producer of vinyl acetate monomer and the
largest North American producer of methanol, the major raw material
used for the production of acetic acid. We are also the largest
polyvinyl alcohol producer in North America. These products are
generally used as building blocks for value-added products or in
intermediate chemicals used in the paints, coatings, inks, adhesives,
films, textiles and building products industries. Other chemicals
produced in this segment are organic solvents and intermediates for
pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical products. For the three
months ended March 31, 2004, net sales by the Predecessor to external
customers of acetyls were $371 million, acetyl derivatives and polyols
were $205 million and all other business lines combined totaled $213
million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, net sales by the
Successor to external customers of acetyls were $1,187 million, acetyl
derivatives and polyols were $691 million and all other business lines
combined totaled $613 million.

Technical Polymers Ticona

Our Technical Polymers Ticona segment develops, produces and
supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical polymers for
application in automotive and electronics products and in other
consumer and industrial applications, often replacing metal or glass.
Together with our 45%-owned venture Polyplastics, our
50%-owned venture Korea Engineering Plastics Company Ltd., or
KEPCO, and Fortron Industries, our 50-50 venture with Kureha Chemicals
Industry of Japan, we are a leading participant in the global technical
polymers business. The primary products within the Ticona segment are
polyacetal products or POM, and GUR, an ultra-high molecular weight
polyethylene. POM is used in a broad range of products including
automotive components, electronics and appliances. GUR is used in
battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration equipment, coatings and
medical devices. For the three months ended March 31, 2004, sales by
the Predecessor to external customers in the Technical Polymers Ticona
segment totaled $227 million. For the nine months ended December 31,
2004, sales by the Successor to external customers in the Technical
Polymers Ticona segment totaled $636 million.

Acetate
Products

Our Acetate Products segment primarily produces and
supplies acetate tow, which is used in the production of filter
products and acetate filament, which is used in the apparel and home
furnishing industries. Our acetate products are sold into a diverse set
of end market applications, including filter products, fashion apparel,
linings and home furnishings. We are one of the world's leading
producers of acetate tow and acetate filament, including production by
our ventures in China. In October 2004, we announced plans to
consolidate our acetate flake and tow manufacturing by early 2007 and
to exit the acetate filament business by mid-2005. This restructuring
is being implemented to increase efficiency, reduce over-capacities in
certain manufacturing areas and to focus on products and markets that
provide long-term value. For the three months ended March 31, 2004,
sales by the Predecessor to external customers for the Acetate Products
segments were $172 million. For the nine months ended December 31,
2004, sales by the Successor to external customers for the Acetate
Products segments were $523 million.

Performance Products

The Performance Products segment operates under the trade name of
Nutrinova and produces and sells Sunett high intensity sweetener and
food protection ingredients, such as sorbates, for the food, beverage
and pharmaceuticals industries. For the three months ended March 31,
2004, sales by the Predecessor to external customers of Performance
Products were $44 million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
sales by the Successor to external customers of Performance Products
were $131 million.

Competitive Strengths

We have
benefited from a number of competitive strengths, including the
following:


Leading Market Positions

We have
#1 or #2 market positions globally in products that make up a majority
of our sales, according to the SRI Handbook and the Tecnon Orbichem
Survey. We are a leading global producer of acetic acid and the
world's largest producer of vinyl acetate monomer. Ticona and our
ventures, Polyplastics and KEPCO, are leading suppliers of polyacetal
products and other engineering resins in North America, Europe and the
Asia/Pacific region. Our leadership positions are based on our large
share of global production capacity, operating efficiencies,
proprietary technology and competitive cost structures in our major
products.

Proprietary Production Technology and Operating
Expertise

Our production of acetyl products employs industry
leading proprietary and licensed technologies, including our
proprietary AO Plus acid-optimization technology for the production of
acetic acid and VAntage vinyl acetate monomer technology. AO Plus
enables plant capacity to be increased with minimal investment, while
VAntage enables significant increases in production efficiencies, lower
operating costs and increases in capacity at ten to fifteen percent of
the cost of building a new plant.

Low Cost Producer

Our
competitive cost structures are based on economies of scale, vertical
integration, technical know-how and the use of advanced
technologies.

Global Reach

We operate 29 production
facilities (excluding our ventures) throughout the world, with major
operations in North America, Europe and Asia. Ventures owned by us and
our partners operate ten additional facilities. Our infrastructure of
manufacturing plants, terminals, and sales offices provides us with a
competitive advantage in anticipating and meeting the needs of our
global and local customers in well-established and growing markets,
while our geographic diversity reduces the potential impact of
volatility in any individual country or region. We have a strong and
growing presence in Asia (particularly in China) where ventures owned
by us and our partners operate three additional facilities.

International Strategic Investments

Our strategic
investments, including our ventures, have enabled us to gain access,
minimize costs and accelerate growth in new markets, while also
generating significant cash flow and earnings. Our equity investments
and cost investments represent an important component of our growth
strategy. During the nine months ended December 31, 2004, we received
$55 million in dividends from our strategic investments. During the
three months ended March 31, 2004, we received $22 million in dividends
and other distributions from our strategic investments.

Diversified Products and End-Use Markets

We offer our
customers a broad range of products in a wide variety of end-use
markets. For example, the Technical Polymers Ticona business offers
customers a broad range of high-quality engineering plastics to meet
the needs of customers in numerous end-use markets, such as automotive,
electrical/electronics, appliance and medical. The Chemical Products
segment has leading market positions in an integrated chain of basic
and performance-based acetyl products, sold into diverse industrial
applications. This product diversity and market exposure help us to
reduce the potential impact of volatility in any individual market
segment.

Business Strategies

We are focused on
increasing operating cash flows, profitability, return on investment
and shareholder value, which we believe can be achieved through the
following business strategies:

Maintain Cost Advantage and
Productivity Leadership

We continually seek to reduce our
production and raw material costs. We announced in July 2003 that we
intend to purchase most of our North American internal methanol
requirements from Southern


Chemical Corporation beginning in July 2005
under a multi-year agreement at a lower cost than our present cost for
methanol. Our advanced process control (APC) projects generate savings
in energy and raw materials while increasing yields in production
units. Most significantly, we intend to intensify the implementation of
Six Sigma, which has become a pervasive and important tool in both
operations and administration for achieving greater productivity and
growth. We are also engaged in several projects and process technology
improvements focused on energy reduction. For example, by implementing
modifications and improvements in the distillation systems at our
Calvert City, Kentucky polyvinyl alcohol plant, we were able to achieve
a 17% reduction in steam usage. Using less energy-intense
technology to more efficiently reduce acetic acid impurities at our
Clear Lake Plant has also enabled reductions in steam and electricity
usage. We intend to continue using best practices to reduce costs and
increase equipment reliability in maintenance and project
engineering.

Focused Business Investment

We intend to
continue investing strategically in growth areas, including new
production capacity, to extend our global market leadership position.
Historically, our strong market position has enabled us to initiate
capacity growth to take advantage of projected demand growth. For
example, we are building a 600,000 metric ton per year world-scale
acetic acid plant in China, the world's fastest growing market
for acetic acid and its derivatives. We also increased the capacity of
our GUR ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene plant in Germany by
 1/3 to 10,000 tons per year in the third calendar
quarter of 2004, and in 2004, we also increased our North American
polyacetal capacity at our Bishop facility by 20% to 102,000
tons. We expect to continue to benefit from our investments and
capacity expansion that enable us to meet increases in global
demand.

Maximize Cash Flow and Reduce Debt

Despite a
difficult operating environment over the past several years, we have
generated a significant amount of operating cash flow. Between January
1, 2002 and March 31, 2004, the Predecessor generated over $650 million
of net cash provided by operating activities. Between April 1, 2004 and
December 31, 2004, the Successor consumed over $63 million of net cash
used in operating activities. The cash flow used by operations was
affected by the one-time payment of a $95 million obligation to a third
party, $59 million associated with the exercising of stock appreciation
rights, pension contributions totaling $409 million and higher interest
expense due to increased debt levels. We expect improvement in our
operating cash flow through increased productivity in our operations,
increased cash dividends from our ventures, reduced pension
contributions and pursuing additional cost reduction efforts. We
believe in a focused capital expenditure plan that is dedicated to
attractive investment projects. We intend to use our free cash flow to
reduce indebtedness and selectively expand our businesses. The
operating cash flow used by the Predecessor for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 was $107 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had total
debt of $3,387 million and cash and cash equivalents of $838
million.

Deliver Value-Added Solutions

We continually
develop new products and industry leading production technologies that
solve our customers' problems. For example, Ticona has worked
closely with fuel system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with
the chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure to
hot diesel fuels. In our emulsions business, we pioneered a
technological solution that leads the industry in product offerings for
ecologically friendly emulsions for solvent-free interior paints. We
believe that our customers value our expertise, and we will continue to
work with them to enhance the quality of their products.

Enhance Value of Portfolio

We will continue to further
optimize our business portfolio through divestitures, acquisitions and
strategic investments that enable us to focus on businesses in which we
can achieve market, cost and technology leadership over the long term.
In addition, we intend to continue to expand our product mix into
higher value-added products. For example, we have begun construction of
a 600,000 metric ton acetic acid plant in China, the world's
fastest growing market for acetic acid. The plant is expected to come
on


stream in late 2006 or early 2007. We also
divested non-core businesses, such as acrylates, which we sold to Dow
in February 2004. We also acquired Vinamul Polymers, the North American
and European emulsions business of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC in
February 2005.

Business Segments

Chemical
Products

The Chemical Products segment consists of six business
lines: Acetyls, Acetyl Derivatives and Polyols, Polyvinyl Alcohol,
Emulsions, Specialties, and other chemical activities. All business
lines in this segment mainly conduct business using the
"Celanese" trade name, except Polyvinyl
Alcohol, which uses the trademark Celvol, and Emulsions, which uses the
trademarks Mowilith and Celvolit. In February 2005, Celanese acquired
the Vinamul Polymers, the North American and European emulsion polymer
business of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, which primarily uses the
trademarks Vinamul, Elite and Duroset. The following table lists key
products and their major end use markets.

Business Lines

Acetyls.

The acetyls business line
produces:

•

Acetic acid, used to
manufacture vinyl acetate monomer and other acetyl derivatives. We
manufacture acetic acid for our own use, as well as for sale to third
parties, including producers of purified terephthalic acid, or PTA, and
to other participants in the acetyl derivatives
business;

•

Vinyl acetate monomer, used in
a variety of adhesives, paints, films, coatings and textiles. We
manufacture vinyl acetate monomer for our own use, as well as for sale
to third parties;

•

Methanol, principally
used internally in the production of acetic acid and formaldehyde. The
balance is sold to the merchant
market;

•

Acetic anhydride, a raw material
used in the production of cellulose acetate, detergents and
pharmaceuticals; and

•

Acetaldehyde, a
major feedstock for the production of polyols. Acetaldehyde is also
used in other organic compounds such as pyridines, which are used in
agricultural products.


We are a leading global producer of acetic
acid and the world's leading producer of vinyl acetate monomer
according to the Tecnon Orbichem Survey. According to data from the
CMAI Methanol Analysis, we are the largest producer of methanol in
North America.

Acetic acid, methanol, and vinyl acetate monomer,
like other commodity products, are characterized by cyclicality in
pricing. The principal raw materials in these products are natural gas
and ethylene, which we purchase from numerous sources; carbon monoxide,
which we purchase under long-term contracts; methanol, which we both
manufacture and purchase under short-term contracts; and butane, which
we purchase from one supplier and can also obtain from other sources.
All these raw materials, except carbon monoxide, are commodities and
are available from a wide variety of sources.

Our production of
acetyl products employs leading proprietary and licensed technologies,
including our proprietary AO Plus acid-optimization technology for the
production of acetic acid and VAntage vinyl acetate monomer technology.
AO Plus enables plant capacity to be increased with minimal investment,
while VAntage enables significant increases in production efficiencies,
lower operating costs and increases in capacity at 10 to 15 percent of
the cost of building a new plant.

Acetyl Derivatives and
Polyols.

The acetyl derivatives and polyols business line
produces a variety of solvents, polyols, formaldehyde and other
chemicals, which in turn are used in the manufacture of paints,
coatings, adhesives, and other products.

Many acetyl derivatives
products are derived from our production of acetic acid and oxo
alcohols. Primary products are:

•

Ethyl
acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in coatings, inks and
adhesives and in the manufacture of photographic films and coated
papers;

•

Butyl acetate, an acetate ester
that is a solvent used in inks, pharmaceuticals and
perfume;

•

Propyl acetate, an acetate
ester that is a solvent used in inks, lacquers and
plastics;

•

Methyl ethyl ketone, a solvent
used in the production of printing inks and magnetic
tapes;

•

Butyric acid, an intermediate for
the production of esters used in artificial
flavors;

•

Propionic acid, an organic acid
used to protect and preserve grain;
and

•

Formic acid, an organic acid used in
textile dyeing and leather tanning.

Polyols and formaldehyde
products are derivatives of methanol and are made up of the following
products:

•

Formaldehyde, primarily used
to produce adhesive resins for plywood, particle board, polyacetal
products engineering resins and a compound used in making
polyurethane;

•

Polyol products such as
pentaerythritol, used in coatings and synthetic lubricants;
trimethylolpropane, used in synthetic lubricants; neopentyl glycol,
used in powder coatings; and 1,3-butylene glycol, used in flavorings
and plasticizers.

Oxo alcohols and intermediates are produced
from propylene and ethylene and
include:

•

Butanol, used as a solvent for
lacquers, dopes and thinners, and as an intermediate in the manufacture
of chemicals, such as butyl
acrylate;

•

Propanol, used as an
intermediate in the production of amines for agricultural chemicals,
and as a solvent for inks, resins, insecticides and waxes;
and

•

Synthesis gas, used as an
intermediate in the production of oxo alcohols and specialties.

Acetyl derivatives and polyols are commodity products characterized
by cyclicality in pricing. The principal raw materials used in the
acetyl derivatives business line are acetic acid, various alcohols,
methanol, acetaldehyde, propylene, ethylene and synthesis gas. We
manufacture many of these raw materials for our own use as well as for
sales to third parties, including our competitors in the acetyl
derivatives business. We purchase propylene and ethylene from a variety
of sources. We manufacture


acetaldehyde for our European production, but
we purchase all acetaldehyde requirements for our North American
operations from third parties. Acetaldehyde is also available from
other sources.

Polyvinyl Alcohol

.    Polyvinyl alcohol,
or PVOH, is a performance chemical engineered to satisfy particular
customer requirements. It is used in adhesives, building products,
paper coatings, films and textiles. The primary raw material to produce
polyvinyl alcohol is vinyl acetate monomer, while acetic acid is
produced as a by-product. Prices vary depending on industry segment and
end use application. Products are sold on a global basis, and
competition is from all regions of the world. Therefore, regional
economies and supply and demand balances affect the level of
competition in other regions. According to Stanford Research
International's December 2003 report on PVOH, we are the largest
North American producer of polyvinyl alcohol and the third largest
producer in the world.

Emulsions

.    We purchased the
emulsions business of Clariant AG on December 31, 2002, and the Vinamul
emulsions business of ICI in February 2005. The products from the
Clariant AG business are sold under the Mowilith and Celvolit brands,
and the products from the Vinamul emulsions business are sold under the
Vinamul, Elite and Duroset brands. These products include conventional
emulsions, high-pressure vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions, and powders.
Emulsions are made from vinyl acetate monomer, acrylate esters and
styrene. Emulsions are a key component of water-based quality surface
coatings, adhesives, non-woven textiles and other applications.

Specialties.

The specialties business line produces:

•

Carboxylic acids such as pelargonic acid,
used in detergents and synthetic lubricants, and heptanoic acid, used
in plasticizers and synthetic
lubricants;

•

Amines such as methyl
amines, used in agrochemicals, monoisopropynol amines, used in
herbicides, and butyl amines, used in the treatment of rubber and in
water treatment; and

•

Oxo derivatives and
special solvents, such as crotonaldehyde, which is used by the
Performance Products segment for the production of sorbates, as well as
raw materials for the fragrance and food ingredients industry.

The prices for these products are relatively stable due to long-term
contracts with customers whose industries are not generally subject to
the cyclical trends of commodity chemicals.

The primary raw
materials for these products are olefins and ammonia, which are
purchased from world market suppliers based on international
prices.

In March 2002, we formed Estech, a venture with Hatco
Corporation, a leading producer of synthetic lubricants, for the
production and marketing of neopolyol esters or NPEs. This venture, in
which we hold a 51 percent interest, built and operates a 7,000 metric
ton per year NPE plant at our Oberhausen, Germany site. The plant came
on stream in the fourth quarter of 2003. Neopolyol esters are used as
base stocks for synthetic lubricants in refrigeration, automotive,
aviation and industrial applications, as well as in hydraulic fluids.
We supply Estech with carboxylic acids and polyols, the main raw
materials for producing NPEs.

We contributed our commercial,
technical and operational oxo business activities in Oberhausen,
Germany to European Oxo GmbH, Celanese's European oxo chemicals
venture with Degussa AG. The venture began operations in October
2003.

Facilities

The Chemical Products segment
has production sites in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Singapore,
Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and
Germany. The emulsions business line also has tolling arrangements in
the United Kingdom, France and Greece. We also participate in a venture
in Saudi Arabia that produces methanol and MTBE. Over the last few
years, we have continued to shift our production capacity to lower cost
production facilities while expanding in growth markets, such as China.
As a result, we shut down our formaldehyde unit in Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada in mid-2004. We have commenced building a 600,000 metric ton
acetic acid plant in Nanjing, China, which is expected to come on
stream in late 2006 or early 2007.


Capital Expenditures

The
Chemical Products segment's capital expenditures by the Successor
for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 were $64 million. The
Chemical Products segment's capital expenditures by the
Predecessor were $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004,
and $109 million and $101 million for the years ended 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The capital expenditures incurred during the last three
years related primarily to efficiency and safety improvement-related
items associated with the normal operations of the business, as well as
spending for a new plant for synthesis gas, and important raw material
for the production of oxo alcohols and specialties, at our Oberhausen
site. The new plant, which supplies European Oxo GmbH and CAG, came on
stream in the third quarter of 2003 and has improved reliability and
reduced production costs. Capital expenditures in 2003 also included
the integration of a company-wide SAP system.

Markets

The following table illustrates net sales by
destination of the Chemical Products segment by geographic region of
the Successor for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, and of the
Predecessor for the three months ended March 31, 2004, and for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

The
Chemical Products segment markets its products both directly to
customers and through distributors. It also utilizes a number of
"e-channels", including its website at
www.chemvip.com, as well as system to system linking through its
industry portal, Elemica.

In the acetyls business line, the
methanol market is global and highly dependent on the demand for
products made from methanol. In addition to our own demands for
methanol, our production is sold to a few regional customers who are
manufacturers of chemical intermediates and to a lesser extent, by
manufacturers in the wood products industry. We typically enter into
short-term contracts for the sale of methanol. Acetic acid and vinyl
acetate monomer are global businesses which have several large
customers. Generally, we supply these global customers under multi-year
contracts. The customers of acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer
produce polymers used in water-based paints, adhesives, paper coatings,
film modifiers and textiles. We have long-standing relationships with
most of these customers.

Polyvinyl alcohol is sold to a diverse
group of regional and multinational customers mainly under single year
contracts. The customers of the polyvinyl alcohol business line are
primarily engaged in the production of adhesives, paper, films,
building products, and textiles.

Emulsions and emulsion powders
are sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers.
Customers for emulsions are manufacturers of water-based quality
surface coatings, adhesives, and non-woven textiles. Customers for
emulsion powders are primarily manufacturers of building products.

Acetyl derivatives and polyols are sold to a diverse group of
regional and multinational customers both under multi-year contracts
and on the basis of long-standing relationships. The customers of
acetyl derivatives are primarily engaged in the production of paints,
coatings and adhesives. In addition to our own demand for acetyl
derivatives to produce cellulose acetate, we sell acetyl derivatives to
other participants in the cellulose acetate industry. We manufacture
formaldehyde for our own use as well as for sale to a few regional
customers that include manufacturers in the wood products and chemical
derivatives industries. The sale of formaldehyde is based on both long
and short term agreements. Polyols are sold


globally to a wide variety of customers,
primarily in the coatings and resins and the specialty products
industries. Oxo products are sold to a wide variety of customers,
primarily in the construction and automotive industries and are used
internally to produce acetyl derivatives. The oxo market is
characterized by oversupply and numerous competitors.

The
specialties business line primarily serves global markets in the
synthetic lubricant, agrochemical, rubber processing and other
specialty chemical areas. Much of the specialties business line
involves "one customer, one product"
relationships, where the business develops customized products with the
customer, but the specialties business line also sells several
chemicals which are priced more like commodity chemicals.

Competition

Our principal competitors in the
Chemical Products segment include Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,
Atofina S.A., BASF, Borden Chemical, Inc., BP p.l.c.
("BP"), Chang Chun Petrochemical Co., Ltd.,
Daicel, Dow, Eastman Chemical Corporation

Technical Polymers Ticona

Ticona develops, produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high
performance technical polymers. The following table lists key Ticona
products, their trademarks, and their major end use
markets.

* Fortron is a
registered trademark of Fortron Industries.

Ticona's
technical polymers have chemical and physical properties enabling them,
among other things, to withstand high temperatures, resist chemical
reactions with solvents and resist fracturing or stretching. These
products are used in a wide range of performance-demanding applications
in the automotive and electronics sectors and in other consumer and
industrial goods, often replacing metal or glass.

Ticona is a
business oriented to enable innovations for its customers while closely
working together with them for a new development. Ticona focuses its
efforts on developing new markets and applications for its product
lines, often developing custom formulations to satisfy the technical
and processing requirements of a customer's applications. For
example, Ticona has worked closely with fuel system suppliers to
develop an acetal copolymer with the chemical and impact resistance
necessary to withstand exposure to hot diesel fuels in the new
generation of common rail diesel engines. The product can also be used
in automotive fuel sender units where it remains stable at the high
operating temperatures present in direct-injection diesel engines.

Ticona's customer base consists primarily of a large number of
plastic molders and component suppliers, which are often the primary
suppliers to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. Ticona


works with these molders and component
suppliers as well as directly with the OEMs to develop and improve
specialized applications and systems.

Prices for most of these
products, particularly specialized product grades for targeted
applications, generally reflect the value added in complex polymer
chemistry, precision formulation and compounding, and the extensive
application development services provided. The specialized product
lines are not particularly susceptible to cyclical swings in pricing.
Polyacetal products pricing, mainly in standard grades, is, however,
somewhat more price competitive, with many minimum-service providers
competing for volume sales.

Business Lines

Polyacetal products are sold under the trademark Hostaform in all
regions but North America, where we sell them under the trademark
Celcon. Polyplastics, in which we hold a 45% ownership interest,
and Korea Engineering Plastics, in which we hold a 50% ownership
interest, are leading suppliers of polyacetal products and other
engineering resins in the Asia/Pacific region. Polyacetal products are
used for mechanical parts, including door locks and seat belt
mechanisms, in automotive applications and in electrical, consumer and
medical applications such as drug delivery systems and gears for
appliances.

The primary raw material for polyacetal products is
formaldehyde, which is manufactured from methanol. Ticona currently
purchases formaldehyde in the United States from our Chemical Products
segment and, in Europe, manufactures formaldehyde from purchased
methanol.

GUR an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or
PE-UHMW, is an engineered material used in heavy-duty automotive and
industrial applications such as car battery separator panels and
industrial conveyor belts, as well as in specialty medical and consumer
applications, such as porous tips for marker pens, sports equipment and
prostheses. GUR Micro powder grades are used for high performance
filters, membranes, diagnostic devices, coatings and additives for
thermoplastics & elastomers. PE-UHMW fibers are also used in
protective ballistic applications. The basic raw material for GUR is
ethylene.

Celstran and Compel are long fiber reinforced
thermoplastics, which impart extra strength and stiffness, making them
more suitable for larger parts than conventional thermoplastics.

Polyesters such as Celanex polybutylene terephthalate, or PBT, and
Vandar, a series of PBT-polyester blends, are used in a wide variety of
automotive, electrical and consumer applications, including ignition
system parts, radiator grilles, electrical switches, appliance
housings, boat fittings and perfume bottle caps. Raw materials for
polyesters vary. Base monomers, such as dimethyl terephthalate or DMT
and PTA, are widely available with pricing dependent on broader
polyester fiber and packaging resins market conditions. Smaller volume
specialty co-monomers for these products are typically supplied by a
few companies.

Liquid crystal polymers, or LCPs, such as Vectra,
are used in electrical and electronics applications and for precision
parts with thin walls and complex shapes.

Fortron, a
polyphenylene sulfide, or PPS, product, is used in a wide variety of
automotive and other applications, especially those requiring heat
and/or chemical resistance, including fuel system parts, radiator pipes
and halogen lamp housings, and often replaces metal in these demanding
applications. Fortron is manufactured by Fortron Industries,
Ticona's 50-50 venture with Kureha Chemicals Industry of
Japan.

In December 2004, we approved a plan to dispose of
Ticona's Cyclo-olefin Copolymer ("COC")
business.

Facilities

Ticona has polymerization,
compounding and research and technology centers in Germany, Brazil and
the United States. Ticona's Kelsterbach, Germany production site
is located in close proximity to one of the sites being considered for
a new runway under the Frankfurt airport's expansion plans. The
construction of this particular runway could have a negative effect on
the plant's current production


capacity and future development. While the
state government of Hesse and the owner of the airport promote the
expansion of this option, it is uncertain whether this option is in
accordance with applicable laws. Although the government of the state
of Hesse expects the plan approval for the airport expansion in 2007
and the start of operations in 2009-2010, neither the final outcome of
this matter nor its timing can be predicted at this time.

Capital Expenditures

Ticona's capital
expenditures by the Successor for the nine months ended December 31,
2004 was $64 million. Ticona's capital expenditures by the
Predecessor were $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004,
and $56 million and $61 million for the years 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Ticona had expenditures in each of these three years
relating primarily to efficiency and safety improvement-related items
associated with the normal operations of the business. In 2004, Ticona
completed its expansion of its Oberhausen GUR PE-UHMW capacity by
10,000 metric tons per year, and we also increased by 20% to
102,000 tons our North American POM capacity. The capital expenditures
for 2003 also include construction of a new administrative building in
Florence, Kentucky and the integration of a company-wide SAP system. In
addition, Ticona had expenditures in 2002 for significant capacity
expansions at its Bishop, Texas and Shelby, North Carolina sites.
Ticona doubled its U.S. capacity for GUR PE-UHMW by building a new
30,000 metric tons per year facility in Bishop, Texas, replacing the
existing plant in Bayport, Texas. The new plant came on stream in the
third quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ticona increased
capacity by 6,000 metric tons at its polyacetal products facility in
Kelsterbach, Germany and commenced a further increase of 17,000 metric
tons; however, its completion is dependent upon the action of the
Frankfurt Airport expansion described above.

Markets

The following table illustrates the
destination of the net sales of the Technical Polymers Ticona segment
by geographic region of the Successor for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, and of the Predecessor for the three months ended
March 31, 2004, and for the years ended December 31, 2003, and
2002.

Net Sales to External Customers by
Destination—Technical Polymers Ticona

Ticona's
sales in the Asian market are made mainly through its ventures,
Polyplastics, Korea Engineering Plastics and Fortron Industries, which
are accounted for under the equity method and therefore not included in
Ticona's consolidated net sales. If Ticona's portion of the
sales made by these ventures were included in the chart above, the
percentage of sales sold in Asia/Australia would be substantially
higher. A number of Ticona's polyacetal products customers,
particularly in the appliance, electrical components, toys and certain
sections of the electronics/telecommunications fields, have moved
tooling and molding operations to Asia, particularly southern China. To
meet the expected increased demand in this region, we, along with
Polyplastics, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company Inc., and Korea
Engineering Plastics agreed on a venture to construct and operate a
world-scale 60,000 metric ton polyacetal products facility in China.
When completed, we will indirectly own an approximate 38 percent
interest in this venture. Work on the new facility commenced in July
2003, and the new plant is expected to start operations in the second
quarter of 2005.


Ticona's principal customers are
suppliers to the automotive industries as well as industrial suppliers.
These customers primarily produce engineered products, and Ticona works
closely with its customers to assist them to develop and improve
specialized applications and systems. Ticona has long-standing
relationships with most of its major customers, but it also uses
distributors for most of its major products, as well as a number of
electronic channels, such as its BuyTiconaDirect on-line ordering
system, and other electronic marketplaces to reach a larger customer
base. For most of Ticona's product lines, contracts with
customers typically have a term of one to two years. A significant
swing in the economic conditions of the end markets of Ticona's
principal customers could significantly affect the demand for
Ticona's products.

Competition

Ticona's principal competitors include BASF, DuPont, General
Electric Company and Solvay S.A. Smaller regional competitors include
Asahi Kasei Corporation, DSM NV, Mitsubishi Plastics, Inc., Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company, L.P., Braskem S.A., Teijin and Toray
Industries Inc.

Acetate Products

The Acetate Products
segment consists primarily of acetate filter products, which uses the
"Celanese" brand to market its products. The
segment's acetate filament business line will be discontinued by
mid-2005.

Business Lines

Acetate filter products
are found in cigarette filters and acetate filament is found in fashion
apparel, linings and home furnishings. According to the 2002 Stanford
Research Institute International Chemical Economics Handbook, we are
the world's leading producer of acetate fibers, including
production of our ventures in Asia.

We produce acetate flake by
processing wood pulp with acetic anhydride. We purchase wood pulp that
is made from reforested trees from major suppliers and produce acetic
anhydride internally. The acetate flake is then further processed into
acetate fiber in the form of a tow band or filament.

The acetate
filter products business line produces acetate tow, which is used
primarily in cigarette filters. The acetate tow market continues to be
characterized by stability and slow growth.

We have a 30%
interest in three manufacturing ventures with Chinese state-owned
enterprises that produce cellulose acetate flake and tow in China.
Additionally, in 2004, 21% of our sales of acetate tow were sold
to Chinese state-owned tobacco enterprises, the largest single market
for acetate tow in the world. As demand for acetate tow in China
exceeds local supply, we and our Chinese partners have agreed to expand
capacity at their three manufacturing ventures. Two of the ventures
completed their tow manufacturing expansions in January 2005; the
expansion at the third venture is scheduled to be completed by
mid-year. Although increases in manufacturing capacity of the ventures
will reduce, beginning in 2005, the volume of our future direct sales
of acetate tow to China, the dividends paid by the ventures to us are
projected to increase once the expansions are complete in 2007.

The Acetate Products segment is continuing its cost reduction and
operations improvement efforts. These efforts are directed toward
reducing costs while achieving higher productivity of employees and
equipment. In addition to restructuring activities previously
undertaken, we outsourced the operation and maintenance of our utility
operations at the Narrows, Virginia and Rock Hill, South Carolina
plants in 2003. We also closed our Charlotte, North Carolina
administrative and research and development facility and relocated the
functions there to the Rock Hill and Narrows locations. The relocation
was substantially completed during the third quarter of 2004. In March
2005, we announced the relocation of our Rock Hill administrative
functions to our Dallas corporate headquarters. This relocation is
expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005.

In
October 2004, we announced plans to implement a strategic restructuring
of our acetate business to increase efficiency, reduce overcapacity in
certain manufacturing areas and focus on products and markets that
provide long-term value. As part of this restructuring, we plan to
discontinue acetate


filament production by mid-2005 and to
consolidate our flake and tow operations at three locations instead of
the current five. The restructuring resulted in $50 million of asset
impairment charges and charges to depreciation related to $12 million
in asset retirement obligations, of which $8 million was recorded by
the Acetate Products segment and $4 million was recorded by the
Chemical Products segment. In addition, Celanese recorded severance
liabilities of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2004,
with a corresponding increase in goodwill. Sales of acetate filament by
the Predecessor for the three months ended March 31, 2004 were $25
million, and sales of acetate filament by the Successor for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 were $83 million. See Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Facilities

The Acetate Products segment has production sites in the United
States, Canada, Mexico and Belgium, and participates in three
manufacturing ventures in China. In October 2004, we announced plans to
close the Rock Hill, South Carolina, production site during 2005 and to
shutdown production of acetate products at the Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada site by 2007. Additionally, filament production at Narrows and
Ocotlan is expected to be discontinued by mid-2005 and flake production
at Ocotlan is expected to be recommissioned in 2005.

Capital
Expenditures

The Acetate Products segments' capital
expenditures by the Successor for the nine months ended December 31,
2004 were $32 million. The Acetate Products segment's capital
expenditures by the Predecessor were $8 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2004, and $39 million and $30 million for the years
2003 and 2002, respectively. The capital expenditures incurred during
these years related primarily to efficiency, environmental and safety
improvement-related items associated with the normal operations of the
business. Capital expenditures in 2003 also included the integration of
a company-wide SAP system.

Markets

The following
table illustrates the destination of the net sales of the Acetate
Products segment by geographic region of the Successor for the nine

conduct business. The following table lists key products of the
Performance Products segment and their major end use
markets.

Business Lines

Nutrinova's food ingredients business consists of the
production and sale of high intensity sweeteners and food protection
ingredients, such as sorbic acid and sorbates worldwide, as well as the
resale of other food ingredients mainly in Japan, Australia, Mexico and
the United States.

Acesulfame-K, a high intensity sweetener
marketed under the trademark Sunett, is used in a variety of beverages,
confections and dairy products throughout the world. The primary raw
materials for this product are diketene and sulfur trioxide. Sunett
pricing for targeted applications reflects the value added by
Nutrinova, such as technical services provided. Nutrinova's
strategy is to be the most reliable and highest quality producer of
this product, to develop new applications for the product and to expand
into new markets. Nutrinova maintains a strict patent enforcement
strategy, which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of
patent infringement matters in Europe and the United States.
Nutrinova's European and U.S. primary production patents for
making Sunett expired at the end of the first quarter of 2005.

Nutrinova's food protection ingredients are mainly used in
foods, beverages and personal care products. The primary raw materials
for these products are ketene and crotonaldehyde. Sorbates pricing is
extremely sensitive to demand and industry capacity and is not
necessarily dependent on the prices of raw materials.

Facilities

Nutrinova has production facilities in
Germany, as well as sales and distribution facilities in all major
world markets.

Capital Expenditures

The
Performance Products segment's capital expenditures by the
Successor were $3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004.
The Performance Products segment's capital expenditures by the
Predecessor were $0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004
and $2 million and $4 million for the years 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The capital expenditures incurred during these years
related to efficiency, debottlenecking, quality and safety improvement
items associated with the normal operation of the business.

Yu Yao/Ningbo, Yancheng AmeriPac and other Chinese manufacturers of
sorbates.

Other Activities

Other Activities included
revenues mainly from the captive insurance companies, Celanese Advanced
Materials, Inc., and Pemeas GmbH or Pemeas. Celanese Advanced Materials
consists of high performance polymer PBI and the Vectran polymer fiber
product lines. Pemeas, a venture with a consortium of investors led by
Conduit Ventures, a London based venture capital company, develops high
temperature membrane assemblies or MEA's for fuel cells. We
contributed our MEA activity to Pemeas in April 2004. In December 2004,
we approved a plan to dispose of our interest in Pemeas. Other
activities also include corporate activities, several service companies
and other ancillary businesses, which do not have significant
sales.

Our two wholly-owned captive insurance companies are a
key component of our global risk management program, as well as a form
of self insurance for our property, liability and workers compensation
risks. The captive insurance companies issue insurance policies to our
subsidiaries to provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in
the insurance market and to lower long-term insurance costs by avoiding
or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory fees. The
captive insurance companies issue insurance policies and coordinate
claims handling services with third party service providers. They
retain risk at levels approved by the Celanese board of directors and
obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk
retained. One of the captive insurance companies also insures certain
third party risks.

Investments

We have a significant
portfolio of strategic investments, including a number of ventures, in
Asia, North America and Europe. In aggregate, these strategic
investments enjoy significant sales, earnings and cash flow. We have
entered into these strategic investments in order to gain access to
local markets, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe
have significant future business potential. The table below sets forth
the earnings, cash flow contribution and depreciation and amortization
of our strategic investments:


The
fiscal year end for all ventures is December 31. Depreciation and
amortization as presented in the table above represents the amounts
recorded by the ventures based on local generally accepted accounting
principles, computed in proportion to our ownership percentage. These
amounts are not included in the depreciation and amortization reported
by the Successor and the Predecessor.


The following are our principal
ventures:

Major Equity Investments

Polyplastics Co.,
Ltd.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd.
("Polyplastics") is a leading supplier of
engineering plastics in the Asia-Pacific region. Established in 1964
and headquartered in Japan, Polyplastics is a 45/55 venture between us
and Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd. Polyplastics' principal
production facilities are located in Japan, Taiwan, and Malaysia (with
an additional venture facility under construction in China). We believe
Polyplastics is the largest producer and marketer of POM in the
Asia-Pacific region.

Korea Engineering Plastics Co.
Ltd

.    Founded in 1987, Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd.
("KEPCO") is the leading producer of POM in
South Korea. We acquired our 50% interest in KEPCO in 1999 from
the Hyosung Corporation, a Korean conglomerate. Mitsubishi Gas Chemical
Company owns the remaining 50% of KEPCO. KEPCO operates a
55,000-ton annual capacity polyacetal products plant in Ulsan, South
Korea.

Fortron Industries

.    Fortron Industries is a
50/50 venture between us and Kureha Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (KCI) of
Japan. Production facilities are located in Wilmington, NC. We believe
Fortron has the leading technology in linear polymer.

European Oxo

.    In October 2003, we entered into a 50/50
venture for European oxo operations with Degussa AG. Under the terms of
this venture, we merged our commercial, technical and operational
propylene-based oxo business activities, with those of Degussa
AG's Oxeno subsidiary. European Oxo has plants in Oberhausen and
Marl, Germany.

InfraServs

.    We hold ownership
interests in several InfraServ groups located in Germany. InfraServs
own and develop industrial parks and provide on-site general and
administrative support to tenants.

Major Cost Investments

China Acetate Products Ventures

.    We hold approximately
30% ownership interests (50% board representation) in
three separate venture acetate products production entities in China:
the Nantong, Kunming, and Zhuhai Cellulose Fiber Companies. In each
instance, Chinese state-owned entities control the remainder. The terms
of these ventures were recently extended through 2020. With an
estimated 30% share of the world's cigarette production
and consumption, China is the world's largest and fastest growing
market for acetate tow products. In combination, these ventures
represent the market leader in Chinese domestic acetate production and
are well positioned to capture future growth in the Chinese cigarette
market. In March 2003, we and our partners decided to expand the
manufacturing facilities at all three ventures in China. The tow
expansion at two of the ventures was completed in January 2005. The
third is scheduled for completion in June 2005. Flake expansion is
expected to be completed in 2007. The ventures are funding the
investments from operating cash flows.

National Methanol Co.
(Ibn Sina)

.    With production facilities in Saudi Arabia,
National Methanol Co. represents 2% of the world's
methanol production capacity and is the world's eighth largest
Methanol producer of MTBE. Methanol and MTBE are key global commodity
chemical products. We indirectly own a 25% interest in National
Methanol Co., with the remainder held by the Saudi Basic Industries
Corporation (SABIC) (50%) and Texas Eastern Arabian Corporation
Ltd. (25%). SABIC has responsibility for all product
marketing.

These investments, where Celanese owns greater than a
20 percent ownership interest, are accounted for under the cost method
of accounting because Celanese cannot exercise significant
influence.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

In the last
three years, we acquired the following businesses:

•

In February 2005, we acquired the Vinamul
emulsions business of ICI.

•

In December
2002, we purchased the European emulsions and global emulsion powders
business of Clariant AG.


In the last three years, we divested the
following businesses:

•

In February 2004,
CAG sold its acrylates business to
Dow.

•

In December 2003, the Ticona
segment completed the sale of its nylon business line to
BASF.

•

Effective January 1, 2002, CAG
sold its interest in InfraServ GmbH & Co. Deponie Knapsack KG
("Deponie") to Trienekens
AG.

•

In December 2002, CAG sold
Trespaphan, its global oriented polypropylene film business, to a
consortium consisting of the Dor-Moplefan Group and Bain Capital,
Inc.

•

During 2002, CAG sold its global
allylamines and U.S. alkylamines businesses to U.S. Amines Ltd.

For further information on the acquisition and divestitures
discussed above, see "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Raw
Materials and Energy

We purchase a variety of raw materials
from sources in many countries for use in our production processes. We
have a policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of
supply for materials. However, some of our individual plants may have
single sources of supply for some of their raw materials, such as
carbon monoxide and acetaldehyde. In 2003, a primary U.S. supplier of
wood pulp to the Acetate Products segment shut down its pulp facility.
This closure resulted in increased operating costs for expenses
associated with qualifying wood pulp from alternative suppliers and
significant increases in wood pulp inventory levels. We have secured
alternative sources of wood pulp supply. Although we have been able to
obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials, there can be no assurance
that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply.
Even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material, there
can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a
major supplier. Nor can there be any guarantee that profitability will
not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of
supply in the event of the loss of a sole supplier. In addition, the
price of raw materials varies, often substantially, from year to
year.

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials
are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply/demand
fundamentals change. For example, the volatility of prices for natural
gas and ethylene (whose cost is in part linked to natural gas prices)
has increased in recent years. Our production facilities rely largely
on coal, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity for energy. Most of the
raw materials for our European operations are centrally purchased by
our subsidiary, which also buys raw materials on behalf of third
parties. We manage our exposure through the use of derivative
instruments and forward purchase contracts for commodity price hedging,
entering into long-term supply agreements, and multi-year purchasing
and sales agreements. Management's policy for the majority of its
natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply
agreements and forward purchase or cash-settled swap contracts. As of
December 31, 2004, there were no derivative contracts outstanding. In
2003, there were forward contracts covering approximately 35% of
the Company's Chemical Products segment North American
requirements. Management regularly assesses its practice of purchasing
a portion of its commodity requirements forward and the utilization of
a variety of other raw material hedging instruments, in addition to
forward purchase contracts, in accordance with changes in market
conditions. Management capped its exposure on approximately 20%
of its U.S. natural gas requirements during the months of August and
September of 2004. The fixed price natural gas forward contracts and
any premium associated with the purchase of a price cap are principally
settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity. The
maturities of the cash-settled swap or cap contracts correlate to the
actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect or securing or
limiting predetermined prices for the underlying commodity. Although
these contracts were structured to limit exposure to increases in
commodity prices, certain swaps may also limit the potential benefit
the Company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity
prices. These cash-settled swap or cap contracts were accounted for as
cash flow hedges.


Research and Development

All of
our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase
competitiveness. Our Technical Polymers Ticona and Performance Products
segments in particular are innovation-oriented businesses that conduct
research and development activities to develop new, and optimize
existing, production technologies, as well as to develop commercially
viable new products and applications.

The Chemical Products
segment has been focusing on improving core production technologies,
such as improving catalyst development, and supporting both
debottlenecking and cost reduction efforts.

The Acetate Products
segment has been concentrating on developing new applications for
acetate tow, such as its use in disposable consumer materials.

Research in the Technical Polymers Ticona segment is focused on the
development of new formulations and applications for its products,
improved manufacturing processes and new polymer materials with varying
chemical and physical properties in order to meet customer needs and to
generate growth. This effort involves the entire value chain from new
or improved monomer production, polymerization and compounding, to
working closely with end-users to identify new applications that can
take advantage of these high performance features. Ticona is
continually improving compounding recipes to extend product properties
and grades, while offering grade consistency on a global basis. In
addition, Ticona is developing new polymerization and manufacturing
technology in order to meet economic and ecological goals without
sacrificing high quality processing.

The research and
development activities of the Performance Products segment are
conducted at Nutrinova's Frankfurt, Germany location. They are
directed towards expanding its existing technologies and developing new
applications for existing products in close cooperation with its
customers.

Research and development costs are included in
expenses as incurred. The Successor's development costs for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004 were $67 million. The
Predecessor's research and development costs for the three months
ended March 31, 2004, and for 2003 and 2002 were $23 million, $89
million and $65 million, respectively. For additional information on
our research and development expenses, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Consolidated
Results— 2003 Compared with 2002—Research and Development
Expenses."

Intellectual Property

We attach
great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights and product designs
in order to protect our investment in research and development,
manufacturing and marketing. Our policy is to seek the widest possible
protection for significant product and process developments in our
major markets. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate
products and product uses. Protection for individual products extends
for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application
filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The
protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country,
depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.

In
most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new substances
and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production
processes. However, we do business in regions of the world where
intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to
enforce. We maintain strict information security policies and
procedures wherever we do business. Such information security policies
and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure
and safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee
awareness training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors and vigorously
challenge patent and trademark infringement. For example, the Chemical
Products segment maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy, which
has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent infringement
matters in Europe, Asia and the United States. We are currently
pursuing a number of matters relating to the infringement of our acetic
acid patents. Some of our earlier acetic acid patents will expire in
2007; other patents covering acetic acid are presently pending.

As patents expire, the products and processes described and claimed
in those patents become generally available for use by the public. Our
European and U.S. patents for making Sunett, an important product in
our Performance Products segment, expire by the end of the first
quarter of 2005, which will


reduce our ability to realize revenues from
making Sunett due to increased competition and potential limitations
and will result in our results of operations and cash flows relating to
the product being less favorable than today. We believe that the loss
of no other single patent which may expire in the next several years
will materially adversely affect our business or financial results.

We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of
protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names become
more important once the corresponding patents have expired. We protect
our trademarks vigorously against infringement and also seek to
register design protection where appropriate.

Environmental and
Other Regulation

Obtaining, producing and distributing many of
our products involves the use, storage, transportation and disposal of
toxic and hazardous materials. We are subject to extensive, evolving
and increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and
regulations, which address, among other things, the
following:

•

Emissions to the
air;

•

Discharges to surface and
subsurface waters;

•

Other releases into
the environment;

•

Generation, handling,
storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste
materials;

•

Maintenance of safe
conditions in the workplace;
and

•

Production, handling, labeling or
use of chemicals used or produced by us.

We are subject to
environmental laws and regulations that may require us to remove or
mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances
at various sites. Under some of these laws and regulations, a current
or previous owner or operator of property may be held liable for the
costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on, under, or
in its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew
of, or caused the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of
whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at
the time they occurred. As many of our production sites have an
extended history of industrial use, it is impossible to predict
precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the
future. Soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of our
sites, and might occur or be discovered at other sites. The
Predecessor's worldwide expenditures for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 and the Successor's worldwide expenditures for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004, in each case, including those with
respect to third party and divested sites, and those for compliance
with environmental control regulations and internal company
initiatives, totaled $22 million of which $2 million was for capital
projects, and totaled $66 million of which $6 million was for capital
projects, respectively. It is anticipated that stringent environmental
regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in
general. Although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures,
due to new air regulations in the U.S., management expects that there
will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total
approximately $30 million to $45 million through 2007. According to our
estimates, there may be an additional increase of approximately $50
million over the $30 to $45 million during that time depending on the
outcome of the pending court challenge to the low risk alternative
method of compliance allowed by recent air regulations for
Industrial/Commercial/Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, but
thereafter management believes that the current spending trends will
continue. It is difficult to estimate the future costs of environmental
protection and remediation because of many uncertainties, including
uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, and information
related to individual locations and sites. Subject to the foregoing,
but taking into consideration our experience to date regarding
environmental matters of a similar nature and facts currently known, we
believe that capital expenditures and remedial actions to comply with
existing laws governing environmental protection will not have a
material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Air Issues

In December 1997, the Conference of the Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change drafted
the Kyoto Protocol, which would establish significant emission
reduction targets


for six gases considered to have global
warming potential (referred to as greenhouse gases) and would drive
mandatory reductions in developed nations subject to the Protocol. With
Russia's ratification in November 2004, the Protocol has been
adopted by enough of the larger, industrialized countries (defined in
Annex I to the Protocol) and came into effect in February 2005 in all
nations that have ratified it. The European Union or EU, including
Germany and other countries where the Company has interests, ratified
the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 and is formulating applicable regulations.
Recent European Union regulations required all EU member states, to
have implemented a trading system covering carbon dioxide emissions by
January 1, 2005. Accordingly, an emission trading system came into
effect at the start of 2005. The new regulation directly affects our
power plants at the Kelsterbach and Oberhausen sites in Germany and the
Lanaken site in Belgium, as well as the power plants being operated by
other InfraServ entities on sites at which we operate. We and the
InfraServ entities may be required to purchase carbon dioxide credits,
which could result in increased operating costs, or may be required to
develop additional cost-effective methods to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions further, which could result in increased capital
expenditures. We have not yet determined the impact of this legislation
on future capital spending. The new regulation indirectly affects our
other operations in the EU, which may experience higher energy costs
from third party providers. We have not yet determined the impact of
this legislation on our operating costs.

In 2002, President Bush
announced new climate change initiatives for the U.S. Among the
policies to be pursued is a voluntary commitment to reduce the
"greenhouse gas intensity" of the U.S.
economy by 18 percent within the next ten years. The Bush
Administration is seeking to partner with various industrial sectors,
including the chemical industry, to reach this goal. The American
Chemistry Council, of which we are a member, has committed to pursue
additional reductions in greenhouse gas intensity toward an overall
target of 18 percent by 2012, using 1990 emissions intensity as the
baseline. We currently emit carbon dioxide and smaller amounts of
methane and experience some losses of polyfluorinated hydrocarbons used
as refrigerants. We have invested and continue to invest in
improvements to our processes that increase energy efficiency and
decrease greenhouse gas intensity.

In some cases, compliance
with environmental health and safety requirements involves our
incurring capital expenditures. Due to new air regulations in the
United States, management expects that there will be a temporary
increase in compliance costs that will total approximately $30 million
to $45 million through 2007. For example, the Miscellaneous Organic
National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants regulations,
and various approaches to regulating boilers and incinerators,
including the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
(NESHAP) for Industrial/Commercial/Institutional Boilers and Process
Heaters, will impose additional requirements on our operations.
Although some of these rules have been finalized, a significant portion
of the NESHAP for Industrial/Commercial/Industrial Boilers and Process
Heaters regulation that provides for a low risk alternative method of
compliance for hydrogen chloride emissions has been challenged in
federal court. We cannot predict the outcome of this challenge, which
could, if successful, increase our costs by, according to our
estimates, approximately $50 million in addition to the $30 million to
$45 million noted above through 2007 to comply with this
regulation.

Chemical Products Issues

Other new or
revised regulations may place additional requirements on the
production, handling, labeling or use of some chemical products.
Pursuant to a European Union regulation on Risk Assessment of Existing
Chemicals, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission has
been conducting risk assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals.
Some of the chemicals initially being evaluated include vinyl acetate
monomer or VAM, which CAG produces, as well as competitors'
products, such as styrene and 1,3-butadiene. These risk assessments
entail a multi-stage process to determine whether and to what extent
the Commission should classify the chemical as a carcinogen and, if so,
whether this classification, and related labeling requirements, should
apply only to finished products that contain specified threshold
concentrations of a particular chemical. In the case of VAM, we
currently do not expect a final ruling until the end of the first half
of 2005. We and other VAM producers are participating in this process
with detailed scientific analyses supporting the industry's
position that VAM is not a probable human carcinogen and that labeling
of end products should not be required but that, if


it is, should only be at relatively high
parts per million of residual VAM levels in the end products. It is not
possible for us to predict the outcome or effect of any final
ruling.

Several recent studies have investigated possible links
between formaldehyde exposure and various medical conditions, including
leukemia. The International Agency for Research on Cancer or IARC
recently reclassified formaldehyde from Group 2A (probable human
carcinogen) to Group 1 (known human carcinogen) based on studies
linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer
in humans. IARC also concluded that there is insufficient evidence for
a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to
formaldehyde, although it also characterized evidence for such an
association as strong. The results of IARC's review will be
examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker
and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements.

We are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from
formaldehyde. We, together with other producers and users, are
evaluating these findings. We cannot predict the final effect of
IARC's reclassification.

Other recent initiatives will
potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a
wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us.
These initiatives include the Voluntary Children's Chemical
Evaluation Program and High Production Volume Chemical Initiative in
the United States, as well as various European Commission programs,
such as the new European Environment and Health Strategy, commonly
known as SCALE, and the proposal for the Registration, Evaluation and
Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals or REACH. REACH, which was
proposed by the European Commission in October 2003, will establish a
system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured or imported to
the European Union. Depending on the final ruling, additional testing,
documentation and risk assessments will occur for the chemical
industry. This will affect European producers of chemicals as well as
all chemical companies worldwide that export to member states of the
European Union. The final ruling has not yet been decided.

The
above-mentioned assessments in the United States and Europe may result
in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved, and in additional
requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use
of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements
could increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical
products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could
adversely affect the demand for these products.

Remediation
Issues

We are subject to claims brought by United States
federal or state regulatory agencies, regulatory agencies in other
jurisdictions or private individuals regarding the cleanup of sites
that we own or operate, owned or operated, or where waste or other
material from its operations was disposed, treated or recycled. In
particular, we have a potential liability under the United States
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as Superfund, the
United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state
laws, or regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions, or through
obligations retained by contractual agreements for investigation and
cleanup costs. At many of these sites, numerous companies, including
us, or one of our predecessor companies, have been notified that the
Environmental Protection Agency or EPA, state governing body or private
individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible
parties under Superfund or related laws. The proceedings relating to
these sites are in various stages. The cleanup process has not been
completed at most sites. We regularly review the liabilities for these
sites and accrue our best estimate of our ultimate liability for
investigation or cleanup costs, but, due to the many variables involved
in such estimation, the ultimate liability may vary from these
estimates.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, InfraServ Verwaltungs
GmbH, is the general partner of the InfraServ companies that provide
on-site general and administrative services at German sites in
Frankfurt am Main-Hoechst, Gendorf, Huerth-Knapsack, Wiesbaden,
Oberhausen and Kelsterbach. Producers at the sites, including our
subsidiaries, are owners of limited partnership interests in the
respective InfraServ companies. The InfraServ companies are liable for
any residual contamination and other pollution because they own the
real estate on which the individual facilities operate. In addition,
Hoechst, as the responsible party under German public law, is liable to
third parties for all environmental damage that


occurred while it was still the owner of the
plants and real estate. However, the InfraServ companies have agreed to
indemnify Hoechst from any environmental liability arising out of or in
connection with environmental pollution of any InfraServ site. The
partnership agreements provide that, as between the limited partners,
each limited partner is responsible for any contamination caused
predominantly by such partner. The limited partners have also
undertaken to indemnify Hoechst against such liabilities. Any liability
that cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no
third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the InfraServ
company in question. In view of this potential obligation to eliminate
residual contamination, the InfraServ companies in which we have an
interest, have recorded provisions totaling approximately $81 million
as of December 31, 2004. If the InfraServ companies default on their
respective indemnification obligations to eliminate residual
contamination, the limited partners in the InfraServ companies have
agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a number of limitations. To
the extent that any liabilities are not satisfied by either the
InfraServ companies or the limited partners, these liabilities are to
be borne by us in accordance with the demerger agreement.

As
between Hoechst and CAG, Hoechst has agreed to indemnify CAG for
two-thirds of these demerged residual liabilities. Likewise, in some
circumstances CAG could be responsible for the elimination of residual
contamination on a few sites that were not transferred to Infraserv
companies, in which case Hoechst must reimburse CAG for two-thirds of
any costs so incurred.

Some of our facilities in Germany are
over 100 years old, and there may be significant contamination at these
facilities. Provisions are not recorded for potential soil
contamination liability at facilities still under operation, as German
law does not currently require owners or operators to investigate and
remedy soil contamination until the facility is closed and dismantled,
unless the authorities otherwise direct. However, soil contamination
known to the owner or operator must be remedied if such contamination
is likely to have an adverse effect on the public. If we were to
terminate operations at one of our facilities or if German law were
changed to require such removal or clean up, the cost could be material
to us. We cannot accurately determine the ultimate potential liability
for investigation and clean up at such sites. We adjust provisions as
new remedial commitments are made. See Notes 4 and 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the demerger agreement
between Hoechst and CAG, CAG agreed to indemnify Hoechst against
environmental liabilities for environmental contamination that could
arise under some divestiture agreements regarding chemical businesses,
participations or assets located in Germany, the U.S. and other
countries that were entered into by Hoechst prior to the demerger. CAG
and Hoechst have agreed that CAG will indemnify Hoechst against those
liabilities up to an amount of €250 million (approximately
$340 million). Hoechst will bear those liabilities exceeding
€250 million (approximately $340 million), but CAG will
reimburse Hoechst for one-third of those liabilities for amounts that
exceed €750 million (approximately $1,022 million). CAG
has made payments through December 31, 2004 of $38 million for
environmental contamination liabilities in connection with the
divestiture agreements. As of December 31, 2004, CAG has reserves of
$46 million for this contingency and may be required to record
additional reserves in the future. See Notes 19 and 27 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2004, the
estimated range for remediation costs is between $100 million and $143
million, with the best estimate of $143 million. Future findings or
changes in estimates could have a material effect on the recorded
reserves and Celanese's cash flows. As of December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, we had reserves of $143 million and $159 million,
respectively, for environmental matters worldwide. We regularly review
the liabilities for these sites and have accrued our best estimate of
an ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs, but, due to
many variables involved in such estimation, the ultimate liability may
vary from these estimates.

Organizational Structure

Significant Subsidiaries

We operate our global businesses
through subsidiaries in Europe, North America and Asia, all of which
are owned indirectly through a series of holding companies. Our
European and Asian subsidiaries, including Celanese Chemicals Europe
GmbH, Ticona GmbH, Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food


Ingredients GmbH, and Celanese Singapore
Pte., Ltd., are owned indirectly by CAG. In North America, many of the
businesses are consolidated under CAC which, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, CNA Holdings, Inc., directly or indirectly owns the North
American operating companies. These include Celanese Ltd., Ticona
Polymers, Inc., Celanese Acetate LLC, and Grupo Celanese S.A.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
9,100 employees worldwide from continuing operations, compared to 9,500
as of December 31, 2003. This represents a decrease of approximately 4
percent. The following table sets forth the approximate number of
employees on a continuing basis as of December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002.

Many
of our employees are unionized, particularly in Germany, Canada,
Mexico, Brazil, Belgium and France. However, in the United States, less
than one quarter of our employees are unionized. Moreover, in Germany
and France, wages and general working conditions are often the subject
of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Within the
limits established by these agreements, our various subsidiaries
negotiate directly with the unions and other labor organizations, such
as workers' councils, representing the employees. Collective
bargaining agreements between the German chemical employers
associations and unions relating to remuneration typically have a term
of one year, while in the United States a three year term for
collective bargaining agreements is typical. We offer comprehensive
benefit plans for employees and their families and believe our
relations with employees are satisfactory.


Item

Properties

Description of Property

As
of December 31, 2004, we had numerous production and manufacturing
facilities throughout the world. We also own or lease other properties,
including office buildings, warehouses, pipelines, research and
development facilities and sales offices. The following table sets
forth a list of our principal production and other facilities
throughout the world as of December 31,
2004.



(1)

Filament
production at Narrows and Ocotlan is expected to be discontinued by
mid-2005. Flake production at Ocotlan is expected to be recommissioned
in 2005.

Polyplastics has its principal production
facilities in Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia. Korea Engineering Plastics
has its principal production facilities in South Korea. Our Chemical
Products segment has ventures with manufacturing facilities in Saudi
Arabia and Germany and its Acetate Products segment has three ventures
with production facilities in China.

During the nine months
ended December 31, 2004, the Successor and its consolidated
subsidiaries, in the aggregate, had capital expenditures for the
expansion and modernization of production, manufacturing, research and
administrative facilities of $166 million. During the three months
ended March 31, 2004, the Predecessor and its consolidated
subsidiaries, in the aggregate, had capital expenditures for the
expansion and modernization of production, manufacturing, research and
administrative facilities of $44 million. In 2003 and 2002, these
expenditures amounted to $211 million and $203 million, respectively.
We believe that our current facilities and those of our consolidated
subsidiaries are adequate to meet the requirements of our present and
foreseeable future operations. We continue to review our capacity
requirements as part of our strategy to maximize our global
manufacturing efficiency.

issues associated with our properties, see
"Business—Environmental and Other
Regulation" and "Management's

Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Environmental
Matters." Additional information with respect to our
property, plant and equipment, and leases is contained in Notes 12 and
25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

We are involved in a number of legal
proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of
our business, relating to such matters as product liability,
anti-trust, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into
the environment. While it is impossible at this time to determine with
certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, lawsuits and
claims, management believes that adequate provisions have been made and
that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, but may have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period. See
also Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Plumbing
Actions

CNA Holdings, Inc. ("CNA
Holdings"), a U.S. subsidiary of Celanese, included the
U.S. business now conducted by the Ticona segment, CNA Holdings, along
with Shell Oil Company ("Shell"), DuPont and
others, have been the defendants in a series of lawsuits, including a
number of class actions, alleging that plastics manufactured by these
companies that were utilized in the production of plumbing systems for
residential property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to
fail. Based on, among other things, the findings of outside experts and
the successful use of Ticona's acetal copolymer in similar
applications, CNA Holdings does not believe Ticona's acetal
copolymer was defective or caused the plumbing systems to fail. In many
cases CNA Holdings' exposure may be limited by invocation of the
statute of limitations since CNA Holdings ceased selling the resin for
use in the plumbing systems in site built homes during 1986 and in
manufactured homes during 1990.

CNA Holdings has been named a
defendant in ten putative class actions, further described below, as
well as a defendant in other non-class actions filed in ten states, the
U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. In these actions, the plaintiffs
typically have sought recovery for alleged property damages and, in
some cases, additional damages under the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices Act or similar type statutes. Damage amounts have not been
specified.

Developments under these matters are as
follows:

•

Dilday, et al. v. Hoechst
Celanese Corporation, et al.—Weakley County, Tennessee 27th
Judicial Chancery Court

.    Class certification of recreational
vehicle owners was denied in July 2001, and cases are proceeding on an
individual basis.

•

Shelter General
Insurance Co., et al. v. Shell Oil Company, et al.—Weakley
County, Tennessee Chancery Court

.    In April 2000, the U.S.
District Court for the District of New Jersey denied class
certification for a putative class action (of insurance companies with
respect to subrogation claims). The plaintiffs' appeal to the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals was denied in July 2000, and the case
was subsequently dismissed. In September 2000, a similar putative class
action seeking certification of the same class that was denied in the
New Jersey matter was filed in Tennessee state court. The Tennessee
court denied certification in March 2002, and plaintiffs are attempting
an appeal. Cases are continuing on an individual basis.

•

Tom Tranter v. Shell Oil Company, et
al.—Ontario Court, General Division; Gariepy, et al. v. Shell Oil
Company, et al.—Ontario Court, General Division

.    These
matters, which the Court consolidated, were denied class certification
but are currently on appeal. Dupont and Shell have each settled these
matters, as well as the Couture and Furlan matters below. Their
settlement agreements have been approved by the Court. We are the only
defendant remaining in this lawsuit.

•

Richard Couture, et al. v. Shell Oil
Company, et al.—Superior Court, Providence of Quebec; Furlan v.
Shell Oil Company, et al.—British Columbia Supreme Court,
Vancouver Registry.

Dupont and Shell have each settled these
matters, as noted above. CNA Holdings is the only defendant remaining
in these lawsuits. They are "on hold" pending
the outcome of the appeal in the Tranter and Gariepy matters above, as
in Canadian practice, Ontario tends to be the "lead
jurisdiction" in such
cases.


•

Howard, et al.
v. Shell Oil Company, et al.—9th Judicial Circuit Court of Common
Pleas, Charleston County, South Carolina; Viera, et al. v. Hoechst
Celanese Corporation, et al.—11th Judicial Circuit Court, Dade
County, Florida; Fry, et al. v. Hoechst Celanese Chemical Group, Inc.,
et al.—5th Judicial Circuit Court, Marion County,
Florida.

Certification has been denied in these putative class
actions pending in South Carolina and Florida state courts. The
Plaintiff's petition to appeal the Howard matter to the United
States Supreme Court was denied in late September 2004, and CNA
Holdings' motion to dismiss has been granted. Although plaintiffs
in Viera and Fry subsequently sought to bring actions individually,
they were dismissed, and their appeal was denied.

•

Richard, et al. v. Hoechst Celanese
Chemical Group, Inc., et al.—U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, Texarkana Division

.    The court denied
certification of a putative class action in March 2002, and the Fifth
Circuit Court has upheld the dismissal. The plaintiff's petition
to appeal to the United States Supreme Court was denied in late
September 2004.

•

St. Croix Ltd., et
al. v. Shell Oil Company, et al.—Virgin Islands Territorial
Court, St. Croix Division

.    The court in a putative class
action denied certification to a U.S. territories-wide class and
dismissed CNA Holdings on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs are
seeking reconsideration of those rulings.

•

Vickers, et al. v. Shell Oil Company, et
al.—U.S. District Court—Northern District of
Indiana

.    A putative nationwide class action was filed in
federal court in December 2002 against, among others, CNA Holdings and
Shell. CNA Holding's motion to dismiss this lawsuit was granted
in December 2003. The plaintiffs' appeal to the 7th Circuit of
Appeals in January 2004 was dismissed.

In order to reduce
litigation expenses and to provide relief to qualifying homeowners, in
November 1995, CNA Holdings, DuPont and Shell Oil Company entered into
national class action settlements, which have been approved by the
courts. The settlements call for the replacement of plumbing systems of
claimants who have had qualifying leaks, as well as reimbursements for
certain leak damage. Furthermore, the three companies have agreed to
fund these replacements and reimbursements up to $950 million. As of
December 31, 2004, the funding is $1,073 million due to additional
contributions and funding commitments made primarily by other parties.
There are additional pending lawsuits in approximately 5 jurisdictions
not covered by this settlement; however, these cases do not involve
(either individually or in the aggregate) a large number of homes, and
management does not expect the obligations arising from these lawsuits
to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

In 1995, CNA
Holdings and Shell Oil Company settled the claims relating to
individuals in Texas owning a total of 110,000 property units, who are
represented by a Texas law firm, for an amount that will not exceed
$170 million. These claimants are also eligible for a replumb of their
homes in accordance with terms similar to those of the national class
action settlement. CNA Holdings' and Shell Oil Company's
contributions under this settlement were subject to allocation as
determined by binding arbitration.

In addition, a lawsuit filed
in November 1989 in Delaware Chancery Court, between CNA Holdings and
various of its insurance companies relating to all claims incurred and
to be incurred for the product liability exposure led to a partial
declaratory judgment in CNA Holdings' favor. As a result,
settlements have been reached with a majority of CNA Holdings'
insurers specifying their responsibility for these claims. However, in
January 2000, CNA Holdings filed a motion in Superior State Court in
Wilmington, Delaware to set a trial date with respect to this lawsuit
against one insurer, asserting that the settlement is void because the
insurer refused to make the required "coverage in
place" payments to CNA Holdings. The insurer and CNA
Holdings signed a settlement agreement in June 2003. Pursuant to the
settlement agreement, the insurer agreed to pay CNA Holdings $105
million in five annual installments in satisfaction of all claims
incurred and to be incurred for the product liability expense
previously covered by the insurer. In February 2005, CNA Holdings
reached a settlement agreement with another insurer, pursuant to which
the insurer agreed to pay CNA Holdings $44 million in exchange for the
release of certain claims. This amount was recorded as a reduction of
goodwill.

Management believes that the plumbing actions are
adequately provided for in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
that they will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position.


However, if we were to incur an additional
charge for this matter, such a charge would not be expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, but may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in
any given accounting period. No assurance can be given that our
litigation reserves will be adequate or that we will fully recover
claims under our insurance policies.

Sorbates Antitrust
Actions

In 1998, Nutrinova, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of
Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients GmbH, then a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Hoechst, received a grand jury subpoena from
the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California in connection with a criminal antitrust investigation of the
sorbates industry. On May 3, 1999, Hoechst and the U.S. Federal
Government entered into an agreement under which Hoechst pled guilty to
a one-count indictment charging Hoechst with participating in a
conspiracy to fix prices and allocate market shares of sorbates sold in
the United States. Hoechst and the U.S. Federal Government agreed to
recommend that the U.S. District Court fine Hoechst $36 million,
payable over five years, with the last payment of $5 million being paid
in June 2004. Hoechst also agreed to cooperate with the U.S. Federal
investigation and prosecutions related to the sorbates industry. The
U.S. District Court accepted this plea on June 18, 1999 and imposed a
penalty as recommended in the plea agreement.

Nutrinova and
Hoechst have cooperated with the European Commission since 1998 in
connection with matters relating to the sorbates industry. In May 2002,
the European Commission informed Hoechst of its intent to investigate
officially the sorbates industry, and in early January 2003, the
European Commission served Hoechst, Nutrinova and a number of
competitors with a statement of objections alleging unlawful,
anticompetitive behavior affecting the European sorbates market. In
October 2003, the European Commission ruled that Hoechst, Chisso
Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd., The Nippon Synthetic
Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd.
operated a cartel in the European sorbates market between 1979 and
1996. The European Commission imposed a total fine of
€138.4 million (approximately $189 million), of which
€99 million (approximately $135 million) was assessed
against Hoechst. The case against Nutrinova was closed. The fine
against Hoechst is based on the European Commission's finding
that Hoechst does not qualify under the leniency policy, is a repeat
violator and, together with Daicel, was a co-conspirator. In
Hoechst's favor, the European Commission gave a discount for
cooperating in the investigation. Hoechst appealed the European
Commission's decision in December 2003, and that appeal is still
pending.

In addition, several civil antitrust actions by
sorbates customers, seeking monetary damages and other relief for
alleged conduct involving the sorbates industry, have been filed in
U.S. state and federal courts naming Hoechst, Nutrinova, and our other
subsidiaries, as well as other sorbates manufacturers, as defendants.
Many of these actions have been settled and dismissed by the court. One
private action,

Kerr v. Eastman Chemical Co. et al.

, is still
pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Gloucester
County. The plaintiff alleges violations of the New Jersey Antitrust
Act and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and seeks unspecified
damages.

In July 2001, Hoechst and Nutrinova entered into an
agreement with the Attorneys General of 33 states, pursuant to which
the statutes of limitations were tolled pending the states'
investigations. This agreement expired in July 2003. Since October
2002, the Attorneys General for New York, Illinois, Ohio, Utah and
Idaho filed suit on behalf of indirect purchasers in their respective
states. The Utah, Nevada and Idaho actions have been dismissed as to
Hoechst, Nutrinova and CAG. A motion for reconsideration is pending in
Nevada. An appeal filed in Idaho was dismissed and that dismissal was
upheld by the Idaho Supreme Court. The Ohio and Illinois actions have
been settled, and the Idaho action was dismissed in February 2005. The
New York action,

New York v. Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd., et
al.

pending in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County,
is the only Attorney General action still pending; it too seeks
unspecified damages. All antitrust claims in this matter were dismissed
by the court in September 2004; however, other state law claims are
still pending. Hoechst and Nutrinova have filed an appeal of the
court's denial of the motion to dismiss those remaining claims. A
settlement agreement with the Attorneys General of Connecticut,
Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, South Carolina, Oregon and Washington is
currently being negotiated and these Attorneys General have been
granted extensions of the tolling agreement.


Although the outcome of the foregoing
proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe
that any resulting liabilities, net of amounts recoverable from
Hoechst, will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, but may have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations or cash flows in any given period. In the
demerger agreement, Hoechst agreed to pay 80 percent of liabilities
that may arise from the government investigation and the civil
antitrust actions related to the sorbates industry.

Acetic Acid
Patent Infringement Matters

Celanese International
Corporation v. China Petrochemical Development Corporation—Taiwan
Kaohsiung District Court

.    On February 7, 2001, Celanese
International Corporation filed a private criminal action for patent
infringement against China Petrochemical Development Corporation, or
CPDC, alleging that CPDC infringed Celanese International
Corporation's patent covering the manufacture of acetic acid.
This criminal action was subsequently converted to a civil action
alleging damages against CPDC based on a period of infringement of five
years, 1996-2000, and based on CPDC's own data and as reported to
the Taiwanese securities and exchange commission. Celanese
International Corporation's patent was held valid by the
Taiwanese patent office. The amount of damages claimed by Celanese
International Corporation has been reassessed at $35 million. This
action is still pending.

Shareholder Litigation

CAG is
a defendant in the following nine consolidated actions brought by
minority shareholders during August 2004 in the Frankfurt District
Court (

Landgericht

):

•

Mayer v. Celanese AG

•

Knoesel v. Celanese AG

•

Allerthal Werke AG and Dipl.-Hdl.
Christa Götz v. Celanese AG

•

Carthago Value Invest AG v. Celanese
AG

•

Prof. Dr. Ekkehard Wenger v.
Celanese AG

•

Jens-Uwe Penquitt
& Claus Deiniger Vermögensverwaltung GbR v. Celanese AG

•

Dr. Leonhard Knoll v. Celanese
AG

•

B.E.M.
Börseninformations- und Effektenmanagement GmbH v. Celanese AG

•

Protagon Capital GmbH v. Celanese
AG

Further, several minority shareholders have joined the
proceedings via a third party intervention in support of the
plaintiffs. The Purchaser has joined the proceedings via a third party
intervention in support of CAG. On September 8, 2004, the Frankfurt
District Court consolidated the nine actions.

Among other
things, these actions request the court to set aside shareholder
resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting held on July 30
and 31, 2004 based on allegations that include the alleged violation of
procedural requirements and information rights of the shareholders.

Further, on August 2, 2004, two minority shareholders instituted
public register proceedings with the Königstein local court
(

Amtsgericht

) and the Frankfurt district court, both with a view
to have the registration of the Domination Agreement in the Commercial
Register deleted (

Amtslöschungsverfahren

). These actions
are based on an alleged violation of procedural requirements at the
extraordinary general meeting, an alleged undercapitalization of the
Purchaser and Blackstone and an alleged misuse of discretion by the
competent court with respect to the registration of the Domination
Agreement in the Commercial Register.

Based upon information
available as of the date of this document, the outcome of the foregoing
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. The time period to
bring forward challenges has expired.

The amounts of the fair
cash compensation (

Abfindung

) and of the guaranteed fixed annual
payment (

Ausgleich

) offered under the Domination Agreement may
be increased in special award proceedings


(

Spruchverfahren

) initiated by
minority shareholders, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser
can otherwise make available to us. As of the date of this Annual
Report, several minority shareholders of CAG had initiated special
award proceedings seeking court's review of the amounts of the
fair cash compensation (

Abfindung

) and of the guaranteed fixed
annual payment (

Ausgleich

) offered under the Domination
Agreement. This could reduce the funds the Purchaser can make available
to Celanese and its subsidiaries and, accordingly, diminish our ability
to make payments on our indebtedness. However, the court dismissed all
of these proceedings in March 2005 on the grounds of inadmissibility.
The dismissal is subject to appeal.

In February 2005, a minority
shareholder also brought a lawsuit against the Purchaser, as well as a
former member of CAG's board of management and a former member of
CAG's supervisory board, in the Frankfurt District Court. Among
other things, this action seeks to unwind the tender of the
plaintiff's shares in the Tender Offer and seeks compensation for
damages suffered as a consequence of tendering shares in the Tender
Offer.

Based upon the information as available, the outcome of
the foregoing proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.

Other Matters

As of the latest practical date, Celanese
Ltd. and/or CNA Holdings, Inc., both our U.S. subsidiaries, are
defendants in approximately 850 asbestos cases. Because many of these
cases involve numerous plaintiffs, we are subject to claims
significantly in excess of the number of actual cases. We have reserves
for defense costs related to claims arising from these matters. We
believe we do not have any significant exposure in these
matters.


Item 4.

Submission of Matters to
a Vote of Security Holders

On December 31, 2004, the
holders of shares of our capital stock representing all of our then
outstanding voting power by written consent without a meeting (i)
approved and adopted the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and authorized the
reservation of 16,250,000 shares of Series A common stock for issuance
under such plan, (ii) approved and adopted our Deferred Compensation
Plan and authorized awards to be granted under such plan, with the
maximum amount payable to be $192 million, and (iii) authorized the
payment of $15 million in retention and other bonuses to certain
executive officers and key employees.


PART II

Item
5.

Market for the Registrant's
Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities

Market Information

Trading in
Celanese's Series A common stock commenced on the New York Stock
Exchange on January 21, 2005, under the symbol
"CE". All of the shares of Celanese's
Series B common stock are held by the Original Shareholders, and there
is currently no public market for these shares.

Holders

As of March 23, 2005, there were 45 holders of record of the Series
A common stock and 4 holders of record of the Series B common stock. By
including persons holding shares in broker accounts under street names,
however, we estimate our shareholder base to be approximately 10,700 as
of March 23, 2005.

Dividend Policy

We declared and
paid, as applicable, the following special Series B common stock
dividends to holders of our Series B common stock, which are required
by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

•

The first dividend was a stock dividend,
pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend to the holders of our
Series B common stock in the amount of 7,500,000 shares of our Series A
common stock (which is the number of additional shares the underwriters
had an option to purchase, but did not exercise such option).

•

The second dividend is a cash dividend of
$804 million, which we declared and will pay to the holders of our
Series B common stock from the borrowings under our senior credit
facilities, the net proceeds from the offering of our Series A common
stock remaining after the repayment of certain indebtedness of our
subsidiaries described under "Use of
Proceeds" below, and the net proceeds from the offering of
our preferred stock.

The stock dividend described above was paid
on March 9, 2005. We expect to pay the cash dividend described above on
April 7, 2005. Under the terms of our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, we have been obligated to take all actions required
or permitted under applicable Delaware law to permit the payment of the
special Series B common stock dividends and to declare and pay these
dividends to the extent there are funds legally available therefor.
Upon payment of the $804 million dividend, the shares of Series B
common stock convert automatically to shares of Series A common
stock.

Our board of directors currently intends to adopt a
policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly
cash dividend on each share of our common stock at an annual rate
initially equal to approximately 0.75% of the $16.00 initial
public offering price per share of our Series A common stock (or $0.12
per share) unless our board of directors in its sole discretion
determines otherwise, commencing the second quarter of 2005. Our board
of directors may at any time modify or revoke our dividend policy on
our Series A common stock. Based upon the number of outstanding shares
of our Series A common stock after the initial public offering, the
common stock dividend declared on March 8, 2005 of 7,500,000 shares of
our Series A common stock and the conversion as mentioned above, the
anticipated annual cash dividend payment will be approximately $19
million. However, there is no assurance that sufficient cash or surplus
will be available to pay such dividend. Further, such dividends payable
to holders of our common stock cannot be declared or paid or have funds
set aside for the payment thereof, unless we have paid or set aside
funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with
respect to the shares of our preferred stock, as described below.

We are required, under the terms of the preferred stock, to pay
scheduled quarterly dividends, subject to legally available funds, at
the rate of 4.25% per annum (or $1.06 per share) of liquidation


preference, payable quarterly in arrears.
This dividend is expected to result in an annual dividend payment of
approximately $10 million. For so long as the preferred stock remains
outstanding, (1) we will not declare, pay or set apart funds for the
payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to any
junior stock or parity stock and (2) neither we, nor any of our
subsidiaries, will, subject to certain exceptions, redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire for consideration junior stock or parity stock
through a sinking fund or otherwise, in each case unless we have paid
or set apart funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid
dividends with respect to the shares of preferred stock and any parity
stock for all preceding dividend periods and except for the special
Series B common stock dividends.

The amounts available to us to
pay cash dividends will be restricted by our subsidiaries' debt
agreements. Under the terms of the senior credit facilities, certain
limits have been placed on the ability of BCP Crystal and its
subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us.
The indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior
discount notes limit, but do not prohibit, the ability of BCP Crystal,
Crystal LLC and their respective subsidiaries to pay dividends. Any
decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other
things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial
condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of
directors may deem relevant.

Under the Domination Agreement, any
minority shareholder of Celanese AG who elects not to sell shares to
the Purchaser will be entitled to remain a shareholder of Celanese AG
and to receive a net guaranteed fixed annual payment (

Ausgleich

)
of €2.89 per CAG Share based on the current German tax
law. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity—Domination
Agreement."

Under Delaware law, our board of
directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our
"surplus" (which is defined as total assets
at fair market value minus total liabilities, minus statutory capital),
or if there is no surplus, out of our net profits for the then current
and/or immediately preceding fiscal years. The value of a
corporation's assets can be measured in a number of ways and may
not necessarily equal their book value. The value of our capital may be
adjusted from time to time by our board of directors but in no event
will be less than the aggregate par value of our issued stock. Our
board of directors may base this determination on our financial
statements, a fair valuation of our assets or another reasonable
method. Our board of directors will seek to assure itself that the
statutory requirements will be met before actually declaring dividends.
In future periods, our board of directors may seek opinions from
outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are
sufficient to allow payment of dividends, and such opinions may not be
forthcoming. With respect to the declaration of the Series B common
stock cash and stock dividends described above, we obtained such an
opinion indicating that we had a sufficient surplus to allow the
payment of these cash and stock dividends. If we sought and were not
able to obtain such an opinion, we likely would not be able to pay
dividends. In addition, pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock,
we are prohibited from paying a dividend on our common stock (except
for the special Series B common stock dividends) unless all payments
due and payable under the preferred stock have been made.

Use
of Proceeds

The net proceeds from the initial public offering
of our Series A common stock, after deducting underwriting discounts
and estimated offering expenses, was approximately $760 million. The
net proceeds from the offering of our preferred stock, after deducting
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, was
approximately $233 million.

We contributed $779 million of the
net proceeds from the offering of our Series A common stock and the
offering of our preferred stock to our subsidiary, Crystal U.S. 3
Holdings L.L.C. ("Crystal LLC"), which used
approximately $207 million of such net proceeds to redeem a portion of
its senior discount notes. Crystal LLC contributed the remaining
proceeds to its subsidiary, Celanese Holdings, which in turn
contributed those proceeds to its subsidiary, BCP Crystal. BCP Crystal
used such proceeds to redeem a portion of its senior subordinated
notes. BCP Crystal used a portion of borrowings of approximately $1,135
million under the amended and restated senior credit facilities to
repay the amounts outstanding under the $350 million floating rate term
loan and expects pay approximately a $577 million dividend to


Celanese Holdings, which in turn will
distribute this amount to Crystal LLC. Crystal LLC will distribute this
amount up to us and we will use it, together with the remaining net
proceeds from the offering of our Series A common stock and the net
proceeds from the offering of our preferred stock, to pay a dividend of
$804 million to the holders of our Series B common stock.
Celanese's acquisition of Vinamul was primarily financed by $200
million of the borrowings under the amended and restated senior credit
facilities. The loans under our prior senior credit facilities will
remain outstanding under the amended and restated senior credit
facilities. The expected sources and uses of funds used in connection
with the Concurrent Financings are set forth in the table
below.

Approximately $227
million, or 22% of the combined net proceeds from the offering
of our Series A common stock and the offering of our preferred stock
will be used to pay a portion of the $804 million special Series B
common stock dividends. In addition, $577 million of the proceeds from
additional borrowings under the amended and restated senior credit
facilities will be used to fund the remaining portion of the special
Series B common stock dividends such that $804 million, or 37%
of the combined proceeds from the Concurrent Financings, will be paid
to the Original Shareholders.

The interest rate and maturity of
indebtedness that we discharged using the net proceeds from the
Concurrent Financings, as well as the use of proceeds from such
indebtedness, are described below:

Senior Discount
Notes.

In September 2004, our subsidiaries Crystal US 3
Holdings L.L.C. and Crystal US Sub 3 Corp., issued $853 million
aggregate principal amount at maturity of their senior discount notes
due 2014 consisting of $163 million aggregate principal amount at
maturity of their 10% Series A senior discount notes and $690
million aggregate principal amount at maturity of their
10½% Series B senior discount notes. The
gross proceeds of the offering were $513 million. Approximately $500
million of the proceeds were distributed to the Original Shareholders,
with the remaining proceeds used to pay fees associated with this
financing. Until October 1, 2009, interest on the senior discount notes
will accrue in the form of an increase in the accreted value of such
notes. Cash interest on the senior discount notes will accrue
commencing on October 1, 2009 and be payable semiannually in arrears on
April 1 and October 1. In February 2005, we used approximately $37
million of the net proceeds from the offering of our Series A common
stock to redeem a portion of the Series A senior discount notes, $151
million to redeem a portion of the Series B senior discount notes and
$19 million to pay the premium associated with such redemption. In
March 2005, Crystal U.S. Holdings 3 L.L.C. and Crystal U.S. Sub 3 Corp.
entered into a supplemental indenture to provide that the Company
guarantee the senior discount notes in order that the financial
information required to be filed under the indenture can be filed by
the Company, rather than the issuers of the senior discount notes.

Senior Subordinated Notes.

In June and July 2004, BCP
Caylux issued $1,225 million aggregate principal amount of
9 5/8% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and
€200 million principal amount of
10 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2014. In
February 2005, we used approximately $521 million of the net proceeds
from the offering of our Series A common stock to redeem a portion of
the senior subordinated notes and $51 million to pay the premium
associated with the redemption.

Senior Credit
Facilities.

In January 2005, BCP Crystal US Holding Corp.,
Celanese Holdings LLC and CAC entered into an Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks and other financial
institutions led by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as
administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., as joint lead arrangers, Deutsche Bank


Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint book
runners, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, and
Bank of America, N.A., as documentation agent, which modifies certain
terms of the credit agreement dated as of April 6, 2004. The senior
credit facilities provide financing of approximately $2.8 billion. The
senior credit facilities consist of (1) a term loan facility in the
aggregate amount of approximately $  1.8 billion (including
approximately €275 million of Euro denominated loans)
which matures in 2011; (2) a $228 million credit-linked revolving
facility which matures in 2009 and includes borrowing capacity
available for letters of credit; (3) a $600 million revolving credit
facility which matures in 2009; and (4) a new delayed draw term loan
facility in the aggregate amount of $242 million which, once borrowed,
shall be treated (as to amortization and repayments) on the same basis
as the term loan facility. We expect to use this delayed draw facility
to finance the acquisition of Acetex Corporation
("Acetex"), a Canadian corporation. The
Company entered into an agreement to acquire Acetex in October 27,
2004, and the closing of such acquisition is conditioned upon
regulatory approvals and other customary requirements. The borrowings
under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an
applicable margin plus, at BCP Crystal's option, either base rate
or a LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for borrowings under the base
rate option is 1.50% and for the LIBOR option, 2.50% (in
each case subject to a step-down based on a performance test). In
addition to paying interest, BCP Crystal is required to pay certain
fees. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity –
Senior Credit Facilities".

Floating Rate Term
Loan.

In June 2004, BCP Caylux entered into a $350 million
floating rate term loan with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as
administrative agent, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as global
coordinator, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., as joint lead arrangers. BCP Crystal is the
borrower under the floating rate term loan. The floating rate term loan
matures in 2011. The borrowings under the floating rate term loan bear
interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at BCP
Crystal's option, either a base rate or a LIBOR rate. Subsequent
to the completion of the Restructuring, the applicable margin for
borrowings under the base rate option was 3.25% and for the
LIBOR option, 3.50%. The floating rate term loan accrues
interest. This loan was repaid in January 2005 as described in
"Use of Proceeds" above.

Use
of Proceeds From Indebtedness Being Discharged and Original Shareholder
Equity Investment

.    The Purchaser used the borrowings under the
then-existing senior credit facilities, together with the borrowings
under the senior subordinated bridge loan facilities, and the cash
equity investment by the Original Shareholders (which included the
proceeds from the issuance of the mandatory redeemable preferred
shares) to acquire CAG Shares in connection with the Tender Offer, to
refinance certain existing debt of CAG, pre-fund certain pension
obligations of CAG, pre-fund certain contingencies and certain
obligations linked to the value of the CAG Shares, such as the payment
of fair cash compensation under the Domination Agreement for the
remaining CAG Shares, and payment obligations related to outstanding
stock appreciation rights, stock options and interest payments, provide
additional funds for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, and pay related fees and expenses. BCP Caylux used the
proceeds from the offering of the senior subordinated notes, together
with available cash and borrowings under the floating rate term loan to
repay its two senior subordinated bridge loan facilities, plus accrued
interest, to redeem the mandatory redeemable preferred shares and to
pay related fees and expenses. The issuers of the senior discount notes
used the net proceeds from the offering to make a return of capital
distribution to Celanese, which in turn made a distribution to the
Original Shareholders, and to pay fees and
expenses.

Selected Financial
Data

The balance sheet data shown below as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the statements of operations and cash flow data for
the nine months ended December  31, 2004, the three months ended
March 31, 2004, and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, all of
which are set forth below, are derived from the Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this document and should be read in
conjunction with those financial statements and the notes thereto. The
statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000 (in the case of the year ended December 31, 2000 only, unaudited)
and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in
the case of the December 31, 2001 and 2000 only, unaudited), all of
which are set forth below, have been derived from, and translated into
U.S. Dollars based on, CAG's historical euro audited financial
statements and the underlying accounting records. This document
presents the financial information relating to the Predecessor and the
Successor.

As of the date of this document, the Purchaser, an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Celanese, owns approximately
84% of the outstanding CAG Shares. Celanese is a recently formed
company which, apart from the financing of the Transactions, does not
have any independent external operations other than through the
indirect ownership of the CAG businesses. Accordingly, financial and
other information of CAG is presented in this document for periods
through March 31, 2004 and our financial and other information is
presented as of and for the nine months ended December 31,
2004.

calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) by the historical weighted
average shares outstanding of the Predecessor. As the capital structure
of the Predecessor and Successor are different, the reported earnings
(loss) per share are not comparable.

In
the nine months ended December 31, 2004, CAG declared and paid a
dividend of €0.12 ($0.14) per share for the year ended
December  31, 2003. Dividends paid to Celanese and its
consolidated subsidiaries eliminate in

Item
7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

You should read the
following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and the
results of operations of Celanese Corporation and its subsidiaries
(collectively the "Company" or the
"Successor") together with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the notes to those financial statements, which
were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The following
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations covers periods prior and subsequent to the acquisition of
Celanese AG and its subsidiaries (collectively
"CAG" or the
"Predecessor"). Accordingly, the discussion
and analysis of historical periods do not reflect the significant
impact that the acquisition of CAG has had and will have on the
Successor, including increased leverage and liquidity requirements as
well as purchase accounting adjustments. In addition, investors are
cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this section
involve both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by
these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature
and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See
"Forward-Looking Information" located at the
end of this section.

The results for the nine months
ended December 31, 2003 and the three months ended March 31, 2003 have
not been audited together with the results of the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31, 2004 and should
not be taken as an indication of the results of operations to be
reported for any subsequent period or for the full fiscal year.

Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures: Management compensates
for the limitations of using non-U.S. GAAP financial measures by using
them to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete
understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business other
than U.S. GAAP results alone. In this regard, we disclose net debt and
trade working capital, which are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Net
debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, and trade
working capital is defined as trade accounts receivable from third
parties and affiliates net of allowance for doubtful accounts, plus
inventories, less trade accounts payable to third parties and
affiliates. Management uses net debt to evaluate the capital structure
and trade working capital to evaluate the investment in receivables and
inventory, net of payables. Net debt and trade working capital are not
a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. In addition,
calculations of net debt and trade working capital contained in this
report may not be consistent with that of other companies. The most
directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP in our financial statements for net debt and trade working
capital are total debt and the working capital components of trade
working capital identified above, respectively. For a reconciliation of
net debt and total debt, see "Financial
Highlights" below. For a reconciliation of trade working
capital to the working capital components, see "Selected
Financial Data."

Basis of Presentation

Impact of the Acquisition of Celanese AG

On April 6,
2004, Celanese Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known as BCP
Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG ("BCP"
or the "Purchaser"), an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the Successor, acquired approximately 84% of the
Celanese AG ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares
("CAG Shares"). The ordinary shares were
acquired at a price of €32.50 per share or an aggregate
purchase price of $1,693 million, including direct acquisition costs of
approximately $69 million. During the nine months ended December 31,
2004, the Purchaser acquired additional CAG Shares for a purchase price
of $33 million. As the additional shares acquired primarily represented
exercised employee stock options, the Purchaser's ownership
percentage remained at approximately 84% as of December 31,
2004.

As part of the acquisition, the Purchaser agreed to
refinance certain existing debt of CAG, pre-fund pension obligations of
CAG, pre-fund certain contingencies and certain obligations linked to
the value of the CAG, such as the payment of fair cash compensation
under a Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement
("Domination Agreement") for the remaining
outstanding CAG Shares and payment obligations related to outstanding
stock appreciation rights, stock options and interest payments, provide
additional funds for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, and pay related fees and expenses.


The funds used in connection with the
acquisition of CAG were provided by equity investments of $641 million
from the Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 1, Blackstone
Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 2, and Blackstone Capital Partners
(Cayman) Ltd. 3 (collectively, "Blackstone")
and BA Capital Investors Sidecar Fund, L.P. (and together with
Blackstone, the "Original Shareholders");
term loans of approximately $608 million, borrowings under senior
subordinated bridge loan facilities of $1,565 million as well as the
issuance of mandatorilly redeemable preferred stock totaling $200
million. The senior subordinated bridge loan facilities have since been
refinanced by the senior subordinated notes and the floating rate term
loan. As a result of the financing, our interest expense currently is,
and will continue to be, substantially higher than it was prior to the
acquisition or as compared with historical CAG.

We accounted for
the acquisition of CAG using the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, this resulted in a new basis of accounting. The purchase
price was allocated based on the fair value of the underlying assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The assets acquired and liabilities
assumed are reflected at fair value for the approximately 84%
portion acquired and at CAG historical basis for the remaining
approximate 16%. The excess of the total purchase price over the
fair value of the net assets acquired at closing was allocated to
goodwill, and this indefinite lived asset is subject to an annual
impairment review. Goodwill in the transaction totalled $747
million.

In connection with the acquisition of CAG, at the
acquisition date, the Company began formulating a plan to exit or
restructure certain activities. We have not completed this analysis,
but have recorded initial liabilities of $60  million, primarily
for employee severance and related costs in connection with the
preliminary plan, as well as approving the continuation of all existing
Predecessor restructuring and exit plans. As we finalize our plans to
exit or restructure activities, we may record additional liabilities
for, among other things, severance and severance related costs, which
may also increase the goodwill recorded. See Note 2 in the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Successor

Successor—Represents the Company's audited consolidated
financial position as of December 31, 2004 and its audited consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended December
31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements reflect the
application of purchase accounting, described above, relating to the
acquisition of CAG.

Predecessor

Predecessor—Represents CAG's audited
consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2003 and its audited
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for each of the years
in the two-year period ended December 31, 2003, its audited interim
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three months
ended March 31, 2004, and its unaudited interim consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and
the nine months ended December 31, 2003. These consolidated financial
statements relate to periods prior to the acquisition of CAG and
present CAG's historical basis of accounting without the
application of purchase accounting.

The results of the Successor
are not comparable to the results of the Predecessor due to the
difference in the basis of presentation of purchase accounting as
compared to historical cost.

Initial Public Offering and
Concurrent Financings

In January 2005, the Company completed an
initial public offering of 50,000,000 shares of Series A common stock
and received net proceeds of approximately $760 million after deducting
underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses.
Concurrently, the Company received net proceeds of $233 million from
the offering of its convertible perpetual preferred stock. A portion of
the proceeds of the share offerings were used to redeem $188 million of
senior discount notes and $521 million of senior subordinated notes,
excluding premiums of $19 million and $51 million, respectively.

Subsequent to the closing of the initial public offering, the
Company borrowed an additional $1,135 million under the amended and
restated senior credit facilities; a portion of which was used to repay
$350 million of floating rate term loan and $200 million was primarily
used to finance the February 2005 acquisition of the Vinamul emulsions
business. Additionally, the amended and restated senior credit
facilities includes a $242 million delayed draw term loan which is
expected to be used to finance the Acetex acquisition.


On April 7, 2005, the Company expects to
use the remaining proceeds of the initial public offering and
concurrent financings to pay a special cash dividend to holders of the
Company's Series B common stock of $804 million, which was
declared on March 8, 2005. In addition, the Company issued a 7,500,000
Series A common stock dividend to the holders of its Series  B
common stock, the Original Shareholders, respectively, on March 9,
2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Major Events In 2004

In response to greater demand for
Ticona's technical polymers, two projects were announced to
expand manufacturing capacity. Ticona announced plans to increase
production of polyacetal in North America by about 20%, raising
total capacity to 102,000 tons per year at the Bishop, Texas facility.
This project was completed in October 2004. Fortron Industries, a
venture of Ticona and Kureha Chemicals Industries, plans to increase
the capacity of its Fortron polyphenylene sulfide plant in Wilmington,
North Carolina, by 25%, by the end of 2005.

In October
2004, we completed an organizational restructuring (the
"Restructuring"). As part of the
Restructuring, the parent of BCP, by causing BCP to give corresponding
instruction under the Domination Agreement, effected the transfer of
all of the shares of Celanese Americas Corporation
("CAC") from Celanese Holding GmbH, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Celanese AG, to BCP Caylux Holdings Luxembourg
S.C.A. ("BCP Caylux") which resulted in BCP
Caylux owning 100% of the equity of CAC and, indirectly, all of
its assets, including subsidiary stock.

Following the transfer
of CAC to BCP Caylux (1) Celanese Holdings contributed substantially
all of its assets and liabilities (including all outstanding capital
stock of BCP Caylux) to BCP Crystal US Holdings Corp.
("BCP Crystal") in exchange for all
outstanding capital stock of BCP Crystal; and (2) BCP Crystal assumed
certain obligations of BCP Caylux, including all rights and obligations
of BCP Caylux under the senior credit facilities, the floating rate
term loan and the senior subordinated notes. BCP Crystal, at discretion
may subsequently cause the liquidation of BCP Caylux.

As a result
of these transactions, BCP Crystal holds 100% of CAC's
equity and, indirectly, all equity owned by CAC in its subsidiaries. In
addition, BCP Crystal holds, indirectly, all of the outstanding common
stock of Celanese AG held by the Purchaser and all of the wholly owned
subsidiaries of Celanese that guarantee BCP Caylux's obligations
under the senior credit facilities guarantee the senior subordinated
notes issued on June 8, 2004, and July 1, 2004 on an unsecured senior
subordinated basis.

If legal challenges of the Domination
Agreement by dissenting shareholders of Celanese AG are successful,
some or all actions taken under the Domination Agreement, including the
transfer of CAC may be required to be reversed and the Purchaser may be
required to compensate Celanese AG for damages caused by such
actions.

In October 2004, we announced plans to implement a
strategic restructuring of our acetate business to increase efficiency,
reduce overcapacity in certain areas and to focus on products and
markets that provide long-term value. As part of this restructuring, we
plan to discontinue acetate filament production by mid-2005 and to
consolidate our acetate flake and tow operations at three locations,
instead of five. The restructuring resulted in $50 million of asset
impairment charges recorded as a special charge and $12 million in
charges to depreciation for related asset retirement obligations for
the nine months ended December 31, 2004.

In October 2004, we
agreed to acquire Acetex Corporation
("Acetex"), a Canadian corporation, for
approximately $261 million and the assumption by us of debt owed by
Acetex, valued at approximately $231 million. Acetex has two primary
businesses: the Acetyls Business and the Specialty Polymers and Films
Business. The Acetyls business produces acetic acid, polyvinyl alcohol
and vinyl acetate monomer. The Specialty Polymers and Films Business
produces specialty polymers (used in the manufacture of a variety of
plastics products, including packaging and laminating products, auto
parts, adhesives and medical products) as well as products for the
agricultural, horticultural and construction industries. Closing of the
acquisition is conditioned upon regulatory approvals and other
customary conditions. We expect to finance this acquisition through
borrowings under the $242 million delayed draw term loan, which is part
of the amended and restated senior credit facilities.


In November 2004, we announced our plans
to purchase Vinamul Polymers, the North American and European emulsion
polymer business of National Starch and Chemical Company
("NSC"), for $208 million. NSC is a
subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
("ICI"). Emulsion polymers enhance the
performance of adhesives, paints and coatings, textiles, paper,
building products and other goods. The acquisition was completed in
February 2005 and was financed through an amendment of the senior
credit facilities.

In November 2004, Blackstone Crystal Holdings
Capital Partners (Cayman) IV Ltd., reorganized as a Delaware company
and changed its name to Celanese Corporation.

In December 2004,
we approved a plan to dispose of the Cyclo-olefin Copolymer
("COC") business included within the
Technical Polymers Ticona segment and our interest in Pemeas GmbH, the
fuel cell venture included in Other Activities. This decision resulted
in $32 million of asset impairment charges recorded as a special charge
related to the COC business. The revenues and the operating (loss) for
COC were $8 million and $(59) million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, $1 million and $(9) million for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and $7 million and $(35) million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, respectively. The revenues for the fuel cell
business were not material for any period presented. Operating (losses)
for the fuel cell business was $(8) million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, $(2) million for the three months ended March 31,
2004 and $(12) million for the year ended December 31, 2003. As of
December 31, 2004, the estimated total assets and total liabilities of
COC, including intercompany payables, were approximately $42 million
and $74 million, respectively, and the estimated total assets and total
liabilities of Pemeas GmbH were $24 million and $3 million,
respectively.

In December 2004, we approved a stock incentive
plan for executive officers, key employees and directors, a deferred
compensation plan for executive officers and key employees, as well as
other management incentive programs. We recorded expense of $50 million
related to these new compensation plans during the nine months ended
December 31, 2004.

as operating profit divided by net sales.


CELANESE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS


Overview – Nine Months Ended
December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine Months Ended

December 31,

All business segments experienced volume growth in the
nine months ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period last
year. The Chemical Products segment benefited from stronger overall
demand, while the Ticona segment grew on new commercial applications
and stronger demand from the automotive, electrical/electronics,
household goods, and medical markets. The performance of Ticona's
affiliates also reflected improved business conditions. The overall
economic environment, however, remained challenging due to higher raw
material and energy costs, as well as weaker pricing for some products
in the Ticona and Performance Products segments compared to the same
period last year.

Net sales in the nine months ended December
31, 2004 rose 10% to $3,826 million compared to net sales for
the same period in 2003 mainly on higher volumes in all business
segments, stronger pricing in Chemical Products and favorable currency
effects, which were partially offset by lower pricing in the remaining
segments and changes in the composition of the Chemical Products
segment.

Operating profit increased by 70% to $78 million
compared to the same period last year. Operating profit benefited from
increased net sales, lower stock appreciation rights expense of $76
million as well as cost savings. These factors were partially offset by
increased raw material and energy costs, higher special charges of $87
million, expenses associated with a new management compensation plan of
$50 million, and higher professional and consulting fees. For the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, operating profit included lower
depreciation and amortization of $40 million resulting primarily from
purchase accounting adjustments and a non-cash charge of $53 million in
inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments.

Earnings from
continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to a
loss of $174 million from earnings of $108 million in the same period
last year mainly due to an increase in interest expense of $263
million, resulting from the higher debt levels and the expensing of
deferred financing costs of $89 million, and the absence of $18 million
in income from the demutualization of an insurance provider, which was
partially offset by higher operating profit of $32 million.

Net
earnings (loss) decreased to a loss of $253 million compared to
earnings of $92 million for the same period a year earlier.

Net
debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) rose to $2,549 million
from $489 million as of December 31, 2003, primarily to finance the
acquisition of CAG and to prefund benefit obligations.

Overview
– Three Months Ended March 31, 2004 Compared with Three Months
Ended March 31, 2003

In the three months ended March 31, 2004,
all of CAG's businesses experienced strong volume growth compared
to the same period the previous year. CAG benefited from increased
activity in some of its markets, such as electrical/electronics, new
applications for technical polymers and food ingredients, and tight
supply conditions in the acetyl products markets. Operating profit
declined, however, due to higher raw material and energy costs, special
charges and the absence of income from stock appreciation rights, which
were partially offset by favorable currency effects.

Net sales
increased 9% to $1,243 million due to volume increases and
favorable currency effects, resulting mainly from the stronger euro
versus the U.S. dollar. Volume increases were particularly strong in
the Acetate Products and Ticona segments. These factors were partially
offset by the effects of transfer of the European oxo business to a
venture in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Earnings from continuing
operations were $55 million compared to $64 million in the comparable
period in 2003. Net earnings (loss) increased to $78 million from $56
million due to an increase in earnings of $30 million from discontinued
operations resulting mainly from the sale of the acrylates
business.

global business environment characterized by higher raw material and
energy costs and modest growth, CAG achieved full year 2003 net
earnings of $148 million compared to net earnings of $168


million for 2002. Earnings from continuing
operations increased to $143 million in 2003 compared to $123 million
in 2002. Earnings from continuing operations excludes the results of
the nylon and the majority of the acrylates businesses, which were
divested on December 31, 2003 and February 1, 2004, respectively, and
are included in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations. Net sales
increased to $4,603 million in 2003 from $3,836 million in 2002 due to
price and volume increases and favorable currency movements.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
interests increased to $196 million in 2003 compared to $180 million in
2002. This increase was primarily due to higher pricing, particularly
in the Chemical Products segment, increased volumes in all segments,
cost reductions, productivity improvements and favorable currency
movements. Additional favorable adjustments included greater earnings
from affiliates, mainly in Asia, increased interest and income from
plumbing insurance recoveries and the demutualization of an insurance
provider, as well as the addition of the emulsions business acquired at
the end of 2002. Also affecting earnings from continuing operations
before tax and minority interests was income of $107 million from
insurance recoveries and $95 million of expense associated with
antitrust matters in the Sorbates industry as discussed below. These
increases were mainly offset by higher costs for raw materials and
energy and increased expense for stock appreciation rights.

Significant items affecting earnings from continuing operations
before tax and minority interests from 2003 to 2002 were
approximately:

Although CAG recorded special
charges of only $5 million, special charges significantly affected the
operating results of the Ticona and Performance Products segments in
2003. Ticona's operating profit benefited from income of $107
million from insurance recoveries related to the plumbing cases. The
insurance recoveries more than offset special charges related to
Ticona's organizational redesign efforts and the closing of a
manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. The operating profit of
the Performance Products' segment was burdened by $95 million in
special charges relating to a European Commission decision to fine
Hoechst €99 million ($115 million) for antitrust matters
in the sorbates industry that occurred prior to the demerger.

Segment net sales in 2003 increased 21% compared to 2002 due
to the inclusion of the emulsions business acquired at year-end 2002
(+8%), favorable currency effects (+5%) and higher
pricing (+5%) and volumes (+4%). These increases were
partly offset by the transfer of the European oxo business to a venture
in the fourth quarter of 2003 (−1%). Operating profit
declined by 32% to $118 million in 2003 compared to $173 million
in 2002. This decline reflected increased raw material and energy
costs, as well as higher expense for stock appreciation rights and
special charges discussed below. These factors outweighed increased
pricing in the Chemical Products and Acetate Products segments, higher
volumes in all segments, particularly in Ticona and Performance
Products, cost reductions, productivity improvements, increased income
from the captive insurance companies and the addition of the emulsions
business.

In the Chemical Products segment, the contribution
from the emulsions business, favorable currency movements and cost
reductions were outweighed by higher energy costs and an increase in
stock appreciation rights expense. Overall in 2003, increased selling
prices offset higher raw material costs, although pricing outpaced raw
material costs in the first half of the year and lagged in the second
half. In the Acetate Products segment, increased pricing and volumes as
well as productivity gains only partially offset higher raw material
and energy prices. Increased demand led to volume improvements in the
Ticona segment on the development of new applications and entry into
new markets, partially offset by organizational redesign costs. Volume
increases for the Performance Products' Sunett sweetener were
offset by lower pricing for Sunett and sorbates.


CAG reduced its net debt by 6% to
$489 million as of December 31, 2003 compared to $520 million as of
December 31, 2002. This decrease primarily represents the net repayment
of $68 million of debt offset by the addition of $38 million of debt
related to the consolidation of a variable interest entity under
Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

. Trade working
capital increased to $641 million at December 31, 2003 from $599
million at December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily related to
favorable foreign currency effects as lower payables more than offset
the reduction in inventory resulting from the high levels at the end of
2002, resulting from advance purchases of wood pulp, a key raw
material, in the Acetate Products segment caused by the shutdown of a
major supplier. Operating cash flow benefited by $180 million relating
to the effects of hedging of currency exposure on intercompany funding
of operations in U.S. dollars, compared to approximately $95 million in
2002. Benefit obligations decreased by $106 million to $1,165 million
in 2003 from $1,271 million primarily due to an increase in the fair
value of plan assets, contributions, payments and a plan amendment
related to the U.S. postretirement medical plan. These factors were
partially offset by the effects of a decrease in the discount rate.

In 2003, CAG took major steps to concentrate on its core businesses.
In September, CAG reached an agreement to sell its acrylates business
to Dow. The transaction was completed on February 1, 2004. On October
1, European Oxo GmbH, CAG's oxo chemicals venture with Degussa,
began operations.

CAG streamlined its manufacturing operations
and administrative functions, mainly in the Chemical Products and
Ticona segments, and, as a result, recorded termination benefit
expenses of $26 million in cost of sales, primarily in the fourth
quarter of 2003.

Summary by Business Segment—Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine Months Ended December
31, 2003 and Three Months Ended March 31, 2004 Compared with Three
Months Ended March 31, 2003

Chemical Products

Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine Months Ended December
31, 2003

Chemical Products' net sales increased by
12% to $2,573 million for the nine months ended December 31,
2004 from the comparable period last year as higher selling prices
(+10%), increased volumes (+4%) and favorable currency
movements (+4%) were partially offset by changes in the
composition of the segment (-6%).

Pricing increased for
most products, particularly vinyl acetate monomer, acetic acid, and
acetyl derivative products, driven by high industry utilization and
higher costs for raw materials. Volumes also increased, particularly
for vinyl acetate monomer, polyvinyl alcohol and emulsions due to
strong overall demand.

The changes in the composition of the
segment result from the transfer of the European oxo business into a
venture in the fourth quarter of 2003 (-2%) and a change in the
structure of the business under which certain acrylates products, which
were formerly sold into the merchant market, are now being sold under a
contract manufacturing agreement (-4%). Only the margin realized
under such contract manufacturing arrangement is now reported in net
sales.

Operating profit increased to $248 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 from $86 million in the same period last
year. Higher pricing, higher volumes, as well as favorable currency
effects, were partially offset by increased raw material costs and
energy. Operating profit was also favorably impacted by lower stock
appreciation rights expense of $18 million and the absence of a loss
from the European oxo business, as well as decrease in depreciation and
amortization expense of $30 million, largely as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments. Operating profit in the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 included a $17 million non-cash charge for the
manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which
was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold.

Earnings
from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased
to $265 million compared to $115 million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2003 as a result of higher operating profit which was
partially offset by lower dividend income from cost investments and
lower equity in net earnings of affiliates due to restructuring charges
in the European oxo venture.

Three Months Ended March 31,
2004 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2003

Chemical Products' net sales increased by 7% to $818
million in the three months ended March 31, 2004 from the comparable
period last year as increased volumes (+5%), favorable currency
movements


(+5%) and higher selling prices
(+2%) were partially offset by the effects of the transfer of
the European oxo business into a venture (-4%) as well as a
change in the structure of the business under which certain acrylates
products, which were formerly sold into the merchant market, are now
being sold under a contract manufacturing agreement (-1%). Only
the margin realized under such contract manufacturing arrangement is
now reported in net sales.

Volumes and pricing for most acetyl
products, particularly vinyl acetate monomer, increased in most
regions, due to a temporary competitor outage and stronger overall
demand.

Operating profit increased to $65 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2004 from $52 million in the same period last
year. Higher volumes and selling prices, as well as favorable currency
effects, were partially offset by increased raw material costs and
spending associated with productivity initiatives, increased energy
costs, the transfer of the European oxo business, and the absence of
income from stock appreciation rights of $4 million.

Earnings
from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased
to $64 million compared to $60 million in the three months ended March
31, 2004 primarily due to a higher operating profit partially offset by
lower dividend income from cost investments and our share of the loss
generated from the European oxo venture.

Technical Polymers
Ticona

Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine Months Ended December
31, 2003

Net sales for Ticona increased by 12% to
$636 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 compared to
the same period last year. Strong volume increases (+11%) and
favorable currency effects (+5%) were partly offset by a decline
in pricing (-4%).

Volumes grew in all product lines,
particularly in core products. Polyacetal volumes grew on stronger
sales in the automotive and medical industries in North America while
European sales benefited from greater demand for uses in consumer
products and the commercialization of new applications. Volumes for
Vectra liquid crystal polymers rose in North America and Europe due to
new commercial applications, such as household goods, and stronger
sales to the electrical/electronics industry. GUR ultra high molecular
weight polyethylene grew as a result of increased sales for new
specialty applications and stronger sales to Asia. Overall pricing
declined due to changes in product mix and ongoing competitive pressure
from Asian exports of polyacetal into North America and Europe.

Ticona recorded special charges of $37 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004 compared to income from special charges of $87
million for the same period last year. The special charges


in 2004 are mainly related to a $32 million
non-cash impairment charge associated with a plan to dispose of the
cyclo-olefin copolymer business. Income from special charges in 2003
consisted of insurance recoveries related to the plumbing cases of $107
million, which were partially offset by $20 million in organizational
redesign costs.

Operating profit decreased to a loss of $12
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 from an operating
profit of $103 million for the same period last year due to the impact
of changes in special charges mentioned above. Results for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 benefited from higher volumes, lower
stock appreciation rights expense of $17 million and productivity
improvements. These factors were partly offset by higher raw material
and energy costs. Operating profit in the nine months ended December
31, 2004 included a $20 million non-cash charge for the manufacturing
profit added to inventory under purchase accounting, which was charged
to cost of sales as the inventory was sold.

Earnings from
continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to
$26 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 from $140
million for the same period in 2003. This decrease resulted primarily
from the changes in operating profit and lower interest income related
to insurance recoveries, which was partly offset by improved equity
earnings from Asian and U.S. affiliates due to increased sales
volumes.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2004 Compared with
Three Months Ended March 31, 2003

Net sales for Ticona
increased by 16% to $227 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 compared to the same period last year as higher volumes
(+13%) and favorable currency movements (+8%) was
partially offset by lower selling prices (-5%).

Volumes
increased in most business lines, particularly in polyacetal and Vectra
liquid crystal polymers. Polyacetal volumes grew in North America and
Europe on sales to new end uses and higher sales to the North American
automotive market. Volumes for Vectra rose due to new commercial
applications in North America and Europe and stronger sales to the
electrical/electronics industry. Pricing declined as lower priced
products constituted a higher percentage of sales and competitive
pressure continued from Asian imports of polyacetal into North
America.

Operating profit increased to $31 million versus $19
million in the same period last year due to higher volumes, lower
average production costs for Vectra, reduced spending partly resulting
from the closure of the Telford, UK production facility in 2003 and
favorable currency movements. These increases were partially offset by
lower pricing as well as the absence of $5 million of income from stock
appreciation rights.

Earnings from continuing operations before
tax and minority interests increased to $45 million compared to $27
million in the same period in 2003. This increase resulted from the
higher operating profit and improved equity earnings from our
Polyplastics and Fortron Industries affiliates due to increased sales
volumes.


Acetate
Products

Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine Months Ended December
31, 2003

Acetate Products' net sales for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 increased by 2% to $523 million
compared to the same period last year due to slightly higher volumes
(+1%) and prices (+1%).

Volumes grew on higher tow
demand in Asia, which was partially offset by lower filament sales,
primarily in Mexico. Additionally, pricing increased for both tow and
filament.

Operating profit declined to a loss of $11 million in
the nine months ended December 31, 2004 from an operating profit of $11
million in the same period last year reflecting special charges of $50
million, for non-cash asset impairments associated with the planned
consolidation of tow production and our planned exit from the filament
business, as well as higher raw material costs. These decreases were
partly offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense of $20
million, largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, and a
lower depreciable asset base, as well as from productivity gains.
Operating loss in the nine months ended December 31, 2004 included a $4
million non-cash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory
under purchase accounting, which was charged to cost of sales as the
inventory was sold.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2004
Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2003

Acetate
Products' net sales in the first three months ended March 31,
2004 increased by 21% to $172 million compared to the same
period in 2003 primarily due to higher volumes (+21%). Average
pricing remained unchanged.

Volumes grew on higher sales of tow,
particularly to China. This increase more than offset slightly lower
filament volumes, primarily in Mexico.

Operating profit and
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests
rose to $9 million compared to $2 million in the same period last year
on higher volumes of tow as well as productivity gains. These increases
more than offset higher raw material costs.


Performance Products

Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine Months Ended December
31, 2003

Net sales for the Performance Products segment,
which consists primarily of the Nutrinova food ingredients business,
increased by 2% to $131 million compared to the same period last
year as increased volumes (+14%) and favorable currency effects
(+4%) more than offset price decreases (-16%).

Increased volumes for Sunett sweetener reflected strong growth from
new and existing applications in the U.S. and European beverage and
confectionary markets. Consistent with our strategy, pricing for Sunett
declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to
major customers and the anticipated expiration of the primary European
and U.S. production patents at the end of March 2005. Pricing for
sorbates, which had been under pressure from Asian producers, began to
stabilize, although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the
industry.

Operating profit increased to $18 million compared to
loss of $56 million in the same period last year, which included
special charges of $95 million related to antitrust matters in the
sorbates industry. Operating profit in the nine months ended December
31, 2004 included a $12 million non-cash charge for the manufacturing
profit added to inventory under purchase accounting, which was charged
to cost of sales as the inventory was sold, and higher depreciation and
amortization expense of $5 million largely as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2004
Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2003

Net sales
for the Performance Products segment increased by 7% to $44
million primarily due to favorable currency effects (+15%) and
increased volumes (+7%). These positive factors were largely
offset by price decreases (-15%).

Pricing for Sunett
sweetener declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher
volumes to major customers, an overall price decline in the high
intensity sweetener market, and the anticipated expiration of the
European and U.S. production patents at the end of March 2005.
Increased Sunett volumes reflected strong growth from new and existing
applications in the U.S. and European beverage and confectionary
markets. In sorbates, pricing and volume pressure from Asian producers
continued due to worldwide overcapacity.

Operating profit and
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests
declined to $11 million compared to $12 million in the same period last
year, primarily due to lower pricing. Higher Sunett volumes and
currency movements partly offset this decline.


Other Activities

Other
Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs, including
financing and certain administrative activities, and certain other
operating entities, including the captive insurance companies.

Nine Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2003

Net sales for Other
Activities increased by 18% to $45 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period last year. This
increase primarily reflects higher third party revenues by the captive
insurance companies.

The operating loss of Other Activities
increased to $165 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004
compared to $98 million for the same period last year. This increase
was primarily due to $38 million in new management incentive
compensation expenses, which includes charges related to a new a
deferred compensation plan, a new stock incentive plan and other
executive bonuses, as well as higher consulting and professional fees,
which includes the advisor monitoring fees of $10 million. The
operating loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 included
income resulting from the reversal of environmental reserves of $12
million, which was offset by expense associated with stock appreciation
rights of $34 million.

Loss from continuing operations before
tax and minority interests increased to $473 million from a loss of
$106 million for the same period last year. This was largely due to
$259 million of higher interest expense from significantly higher costs
of $89 million from the refinancing of debt and increased debt levels,
a higher operating loss and the absence of income from the
demutualization of an insurance provider of $18 million.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2004 Compared with Three Months
Ended March 31, 2003

Net sales for Other Activities
remained flat at $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004
compared to the same period last year.

The operating loss of
Other Activities increased to $64 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 compared to $13 million for the same period last year.
This increase was primarily due to special charges of $26 million
mainly related to advisory services associated with the acquisition of
CAG. Also contributing to this decline was the absence of income from
stock appreciation rights of $7 million.


Selected Data by Business
Segment - Annual Results


Summary by Business
Segment – 2003 Compared with 2002

Chemical
Products

Net
sales of Chemical Products rose 27% to $3,065 million in 2003 as
compared to 2002, due to the full year effect of the emulsions business
acquired at year-end 2002 (+12%), higher selling prices
(+9%), favorable currency effects (+5%) as well as
increased volumes (+2%). These increases were partly offset by
the transfer of the European oxo business to a venture in the fourth
quarter of 2003 (-1%).

Compared to 2002, selling prices
in 2003 increased for major products, including acetic acid and vinyl
acetate monomer, following the substantial rise in raw material costs,
particularly natural gas, ethylene, and propylene. Volumes rose for
acetic acid, particularly in Asia, as volumes were comparably higher
due, in part, to an interruption in production in 2002. Vinyl acetate
monomer volumes were higher in most regions, partly due to competitor
outages, while volumes declined for polyvinyl alcohol in Asia and
specialties mainly in Europe due to competitive pricing.

Chemical Products had income from special charges of $1 million in
2003 and $2 million in 2002. The income recorded in 2003 and 2002
relate to favorable adjustments to previously recorded restructuring
reserves that more than offset employee severance costs related to
production facility closures.

Operating profit decreased to $138
million in 2003 from $152 million in 2002. The contribution from the
emulsions business, favorable currency movements and cost reductions
were outweighed by higher energy costs and an increase in stock
appreciation rights expense of $13 million. Termination benefit
expenses of $14 million were recorded in cost of sales, primarily in
the fourth quarter of 2003, related to the streamlining of
manufacturing operations and administrative functions. Overall in 2003,
increased selling prices offset higher raw material costs, although
pricing outpaced raw material costs in the first half of the year and
lagged in the second half.

Earnings from continuing operations
before tax and minority interests increased to $175 million in 2003
compared to $161 million in 2002. This increase resulted from higher
dividend income from the Saudi Arabian cost investment, primarily due
to higher methanol pricing partially offset by lower operating
profit.


Technical Polymers
Ticona

Net
sales for Ticona increased by 16% to $762 million in 2003 as
compared to 2002 as higher volumes (+11%) and favorable currency
movements (+8%) were partly offset by lower selling prices
(-3%).

Volumes increased in most business lines,
particularly in polyacetal and GUR ultra high molecular weight
polyethylene. The global volume growth in polyacetals resulted from
sales to new customers and new end-uses. Volumes for GUR increased as
the result of the commercialization of new applications in North
America and Europe, as well as the exit of a major competitor in North
America. Pricing declined on a higher percentage of sales from lower
priced products and increased competitive pressure from Asian imports
of polyacetal into North America.

Ticona recorded income from
special charges of $87 million in 2003 compared to expense of $6
million in 2002. The income in 2003 primarily resulted from insurance
recoveries of $107 million associated with the plumbing cases, which
was partially offset by restructuring charges for organizational
redesign costs of $12 million and the closure of the Telford, UK,
compounding facility of $8 million. The 2002 expense resulted from
restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing
operations in Europe and the United States.

Operating profit
increased to $122 million in 2003 versus $23 million in 2002. Income
from insurance recoveries, higher volumes, and reduced spending more
than offset higher raw material and energy costs, lower pricing, and
higher expense associated with stock appreciation rights of $13
million. Ticona continued to incur significant market development costs
for cyclo-olefin copolymers in 2003. Termination benefit expenses of $9
million were recorded in cost of sales, primarily in the fourth quarter
2003, related to the streamlining of manufacturing operations and
administrative functions.

Earnings from continuing operations
before tax and minority interests increased to $167 million in 2003
compared to $35 million in 2002. This increase resulted from higher
operating profit and higher equity earnings from the Polyplastics
venture, due to growth in the Chinese and Taiwanese economies in 2003,
as well as interest income from insurance recoveries.


Acetate
Products

Net
sales for the Acetate Products segment increased by 4% to $655
million in 2003 as compared to 2002 largely due to higher pricing
(+2%) and higher volumes (+2%).

Average pricing
rose in 2003 as higher tow prices offset slightly lower filament
prices. Volumes grew as higher demand for filament and flake more than
offset slightly lower tow volumes, primarily in Europe and Africa.
Despite a long-term trend of declining global demand for filament,
volumes improved mainly due to higher demand from the U.S. fashion
industry. Volumes of acetate flake, a primary raw material in acetate
filament and tow production, also increased due to higher opportunistic
sales in the merchant market.

Acetate Products recorded an
operating profit of $13 million in 2003, compared to $31 million in
2002 as higher pricing and volumes, as well as productivity gains, only
partially offset higher raw material and energy prices. The segment
also incurred costs for transitioning to new wood pulp suppliers as a
primary supplier closed its U.S. facility in 2003. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
("SFAS") No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, the Acetate Products segment recorded a
charge of $8 million, included within depreciation expense, as the
result of a worldwide assessment of our acetate production capacity.
That assessment concluded that it was probable that certain facilities
would be closed in the latter half of the decade.

Earnings from
continuing operations before tax and minority interests declined to $17
million in 2003 compared to $43 million in 2002. This decline resulted
from lower operating profit and lower dividend income from cost
investments in China, where earnings are being reinvested for capacity
expansions.

Performance
Products

Net
sales for the Performance Products segment increased by 12% to
$169 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to favorable currency
movements (+17%) and increased volumes (+6%), partially
offset by price decreases (-11%).


Pricing for Sunett sweetener declined
primarily as a result of lower unit selling prices associated with
higher volumes to major customers and the anticipated expiration of the
European and U.S. production patents in 2005. Increased Sunett volumes
reflected strong growth from new applications in the U.S. and European
beverage and confectionary markets. In sorbates, pricing and volume
pressure from Asian producers intensified during 2003 due to worldwide
overcapacity.

Performance Products recorded special charges of
$95 million in 2003, related to a decision by the European Commission
on antitrust matters in the sorbates industry.

Operating profit
and earnings (loss) from continuing operations before tax and minority
interests declined from $45 million in 2002 to a loss of $44 million in
2003, due to special charges and lower pricing. This decline was
slightly offset by favorable currency movements, higher Sunett volumes,
cost reductions and increased productivity.

Other
Activities

Net sales for Other Activities decreased by
6% to $49 million in 2003 from $52 million in 2002, primarily
reflecting slightly lower third party sales by the captive insurance
companies.

Other Activities recorded $2 million of income in
special charges in 2003 compared to $9 million of income in 2002. The
$2 million represented higher than expected collections of a note
receivable. The $9 million of income in 2002 related to a reduction in
environmental reserves due to a settlement of obligations associated
with former Hoechst entities.

The operating loss of Other
Activities increased to $111 million in 2003 compared to $78 million in
2002. This increase was primarily the result of higher expense for
stock appreciation rights of $27 million and lower income from special
charges, offset by $17 million of increased income from the captive
insurance companies mainly due to a reduction in loss reserves
resulting from expired policies and actuarial revaluations.

Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before tax and minority
interests increased to a loss of $119 million in 2003 compared to a
loss of $104 million in 2002. This decline resulted from higher
operating losses partially offset by lower interest expense and higher
interest and other income, net. Lower interest expense is primarily due
to lower interest rates and currency translation effects as well as
lower average debt levels. Higher interest and other income, net
resulted primarily from income of $18 million from the demutualization
of an insurance provider and the gain on sale of investments of $4
million, partially offset by expense of $14 million related to the
unfavorable currency effects on the unhedged position of intercompany
net receivables denominated in U.S. dollars.

Summary of Consolidated Results – Nine Months
Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Nine Months Ended December 31,

Net Sales

For the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, net sales increased by 10% to $3,826 million
compared to the same period in 2003. Volume increases in all segments,
higher pricing in the Chemical Products segment and favorable currency
effects resulting mainly from the stronger euro versus the U.S. dollar
were partially offset by lower pricing in the remaining segments and
the effects of reductions due to changes in the composition of the
Chemical Products.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales
increased by $144 million to $3,092 million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 versus the comparable period last year. Higher raw
material costs and unfavorable currency effects were partially offset
by decreases due to changes in the composition of our Chemical Products
segment and cost savings. Cost of sales for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 also included a $53 million non-cash charge for the
manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which
was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold offset by lower
depreciation expense, largely as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments.


Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative
expense increased by $96 million to $498 million for nine months ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the same period last year. This increase
was primarily due to new management compensation expense of $50
million, higher consulting and professional fees, which includes
advisor monitoring fees of $10 million, increased amortization expense
of identifiable intangible assets acquired, as unfavorable currency
movements as well as the absence of a favorable adjustment to our
estimate of certain environmental reserves during the nine months ended
December 31, 2003 of $12 million, which were partially offset by $69
million of lower stock appreciation rights expense.

In January
2005, the Company paid $10 million to affiliates of the Blackstone
Group related to an advisor monitoring agreement. This agreement was
terminated concurrent with the initial public offering and resulted in
an additional $35 million payment. As such, the Company recorded
expense of $45 million in the first quarter of 2005.

Special Charges

Special charges include provisions
for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the
normal ongoing course of operations. Restructuring provisions represent
costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major
activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign the business
operations, as well as costs incurred in connection with decisions to
exit non-strategic businesses. These measures are based on formal
management decisions, establishment of agreements with employees'
representatives or individual agreements with affected employees, as
well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan. The related
reserves reflect certain estimates, including those pertaining to
separation costs, settlements of contractual obligations and other
closure costs. We reassess the reserve requirements to complete each
individual plan under existing restructuring programs at the end of
each reporting period. Actual experience may be different from these
estimates.

Special
charges for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 of $91 million were
largely related to non-cash impairment charges of $50 million and $32
million resulting from plans by the Acetate Products segment to
consolidate tow production at fewer sites and to discontinue production
of acetate filament and a decision to dispose of the Ticona COC
business, respectively. Special charges for the nine months ended
December 31, 2003 of $4 million resulted mainly from expenses of $95
million associated with antitrust matters in the sorbates industry and
employee termination benefits of $17 million, which were largely offset
by income of $107 million from insurance recoveries.

Operating Profit

Operating profit for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 increased to $78 million from $46
million in the same period last year. Operating profit benefited from
increased net sales and $76 million of lower expense for stock
appreciation rights and lower depreciation and amortization expense of
$40


million, which were partially offset mainly
by increased raw material and energy costs, higher special charges, new
management compensation expense of $50 million and inventory purchase
accounting adjustments of $53 million and higher professional and
consulting fees.

Equity in Net Earnings of
Affiliates

Equity in net earnings of affiliates rose by $11
million to $36 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2004
compared to the same period last year. This increase primarily
represents improved equity earnings from Asian and U.S. affiliates due
to increased sales volumes, partially offset by lower earnings due to
restructuring charges in the European oxo venture. Cash distributions
received from equity affiliates were $22 million in the nine months
ended December 31, 2004 compared to $8 million in the same period of
2003.

Interest Expense

Interest expense
increased to $300 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004
from $37 million in the same period last year. The higher interest
expense resulted from increased debt levels of $3,387 million as of
December 31, 2004 versus $637 million as of December 31, 2003,
resulting from the acquisition of CAG as well as the expensing of
deferred financing costs of $89 million from the refinancing of the
senior subordinated bridge loan facilities and mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock.

The Company expects to incur expenses of
approximately $105 million associated with the refinancing that
occurred during the first quarter of 2005, which represents early
repayment premiums and expensing of deferred finance costs.

Interest Income

For the nine months ended December
31, 2004, interest income decreased by $14 million to $24 million
compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to
significantly lower interest income associated with insurance
recoveries.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other
income (expense), net decreased by $48 million to an expense of $12
million compared to the same period last year. This decrease is
primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange effects on cash
and cash equivalents and the absence of $18 million in income from the
demutualization of an insurance provider, as well as unfavorable
changes in swap valuations. Dividend income from investments in the
nine months ended December 31, 2004 accounted for under the cost method
decreased to $33 million compared to $46 million in the same period in
the prior year due to the timing of receipt of dividends.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense increased by $41
million to $70 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and
the effective tax rate for this period was negative 40 percent. The
effective tax rate was unfavorably affected primarily by the
application of full valuation allowances against post-acquisition net
U.S. deferred tax assets, Canadian deferred tax assets due to
post-acquisition restructurings, certain German deferred tax assets and
the non-recognition of tax benefits associated with acquisition related
expenses. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by
unrepatriated low taxed earnings primarily in Singapore. For the same
period in 2003, income tax expense of $29 million was recorded based on
a annual effective tax rate of 27%.

Minority
Interests

For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, minority
interests increased to $8 million from $0 million in the same period in
the prior year. This increase primarily relates to the minority
interests in the earnings of Celanese AG.


Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued
Operations

In September 2003, CAG and Dow reached an agreement
for Dow to purchase the acrylates business of CAG. This transaction was
completed in February 2004 and the sales price was $149 million,
resulting in a gain of approximately $14 million. Dow acquired
CAG's acrylates business line, including inventory, intellectual
property and technology for crude acrylic acid, glacial acrylic acid,
ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, methyl acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl
acrylate, as well as acrylates production assets at the Clear Lake,
Texas facility. In related agreements, the Company will provide certain
contract manufacturing services to Dow, and Dow will supply acrylates
to the Company for use in its emulsions production. The acrylates
business was part of the chemical business. As a result of this
transaction, the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to
the acrylates product lines at the Clear Lake, Texas facility are
reflected as a component of discontinued operations in the Consolidated
Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS

No. 144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.

In December
2003, the Ticona segment completed the sale of its nylon business line
to BASF. Ticona received cash proceeds of $10 million and recorded a
gain of $3 million.

Net
Earnings

As a result of the factors mentioned above, net
earnings decreased to a loss of $253 million in the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 from earnings of $92 million in the same period last
year.

Summary of Consolidated Results – Three
Months Ended March 31, 2004 Compared with Three     Months Ended
March 31, 2003

Net Sales

For the three months
ended March 31, 2004, net sales increased by 9% to $1,243
million compared to the same period in 2003. This increase is primarily
due to favorable currency effects relating mainly to the stronger euro
versus the U.S. dollar as well as volume increases in all the segments.
These factors were partially offset by the transfer of the European oxo
business to a venture in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales increased to $1,002
million in the three months ended March 31, 2004 from $935 million in
the comparable period last year, primarily reflecting higher raw
materials costs, increased volumes and the effects of currency
movements. The absence of the European oxo business partly offset these
factors.

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expense increased
to $137 million compared to $108 million for the same period last year.
Unlike the three months ended March 31, 2003, the comparable period in
2004 did not benefit from $16 million of income from stock appreciation
rights. Unfavorable currency movements also contributed to this
increase.


Special Charges

The
components of special charges for the three months ended March 31, 2004
and 2003 were as follows:

The
$27 million increase in special charges for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 compared to the same period last year is primarily due
to expenses for advisory services related to the acquisition of
CAG.

Operating Profit

Operating profit declined
in the three months ended March 31, 2004 to $52 million compared to $72
million in the same period last year. The favorable effects of higher
volumes and favorable currency movements were offset by higher raw
material costs, special charges and the absence of income from stock
appreciation rights. Operating profit declined also due to $10 million
of spending associated with productivity initiatives, primarily in the
Chemical Products segment. Stock appreciation rights had no effect on
operating profit for the three months ended March 31, 2004, as the
share price remained relatively flat whereas in the three months ended
March 31, 2003, operating profit included $18 million of income as a
result of a decline in the share price.

Equity in Net
Earnings of Affiliates

Equity in net earnings of affiliates
rose by $2 million to $12 million for the three months ended March 31,
2004 compared to the same period last year. Cash distributions received
from equity affiliates increased to $16 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 compared to $15 million the same period of
2003.

Interest Expense

Interest expense
decreased to $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 from
$12 million in the same period last year primarily due to lower average
debt levels.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other
income (expense), net decreased by $3 million to $9 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2004 compared to $12 million for the
comparable period last year. Dividend income accounted for under the
cost method decreased by $1 to $6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003.

Income Taxes

CAG recognized income tax expense of
$17 million based on an annual effective tax rate of 24% in the
three months ended March 31, 2004 compared to $24 million based on an
annual effective tax rate of 27% for the same period in 2003.
The decrease in the annual effective tax rate is the result of higher
earnings in lower taxed jurisdictions.

Earnings (Loss)
from Discontinued Operations

Earnings (loss) from discontinued
operations increased by $30 million to earnings of $23 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2004 compared to a loss of $7 million for
the comparable period last


year, reflecting primarily an $14 million
gain and a $14 million tax benefit associated with the sale of the
acrylates business in 2004. The tax benefit is mainly attributable to
the utilization of a capital loss carryover benefit that had been
previously subject to a valuation allowance.

The following table
summarizes the results of the discontinued operations for the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003.

Net
Earnings

As a result of the factors mentioned above, net
earnings increased by $22 million to net earnings of $78 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2004 compared to the same period last
year.

Summary of Consolidated Results – 2003
Compared with 2002

Net Sales

Net sales
increased by $767 million to $4,603 million in 2003 as compared to
$3,836 million in 2002 due primarily to the full year effect of the
emulsions business acquired at year-end 2002, favorable currency
movements resulting from the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S.
dollar as well as higher selling prices and volumes. Overall, all
segments had an increase in net sales.

Cost of
Sales

Cost of sales increased by 22% to $3,883 million
in 2003 compared with $3,171 million in 2002. Cost of sales as a
percentage of net sales also increased to 84% in 2003 from
83% in 2002, reflecting significantly higher raw material and
energy costs, partly offset by increased selling prices primarily in
the Chemical Products segment.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by 14% to $510 million in 2003 from $446
million in 2002 primarily due to a $51 million increase in expenses for
stock appreciation rights, unfavorable currency effects as well as the
inclusion of the emulsions business. This increase was partially offset
by cost reduction efforts.

Research and Development
Expenses

Research and development expenses increased by
37% to $89 million in 2003 from $65 million in 2002. This
increase resulted primarily from currency movements, the inclusion of
the emulsions business and expiration of cost sharing arrangements at
Celanese Ventures during 2002. Research and development expenses as a
percentage of sales increased to 1.9% for 2003 from 1.7%
in 2002.


Special Charges

The
components of special charges for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 were as follows:

In
2003, the Predecessor recorded expense of $5 million in special
charges, which consisted of $25 million of restructuring charges, $6
million of income from favorable adjustments to restructuring reserves
that were recorded previously, and $14 million of income from other
special charges. The $25 million of additions to the restructuring
reserve included employee severance costs of $18 million and plant and
office closure costs of $7 million. Within other special charges there
was income of $107 million related to insurance recoveries associated
with the plumbing cases, partially offset by $95 million of expenses
for antitrust matters in the sorbates industry, primarily related to a
decision by the European Commission.

In 2003, the Chemical
Products segment recorded employee severance charges of $4 million,
which primarily related to the shutdown of an obsolete synthesis gas
unit in Germany.

In 2003, Ticona commenced the redesign of its
operations. These plans included a decision to sell the Summit, New
Jersey site and to relocate administrative and research and development
activities to the existing Ticona site in Florence, Kentucky in 2004.
As a result of this decision, the Predecessor recorded termination
benefit expense of $5 million in 2003. In addition to the relocation in
the United States, Ticona has streamlined its operations in Germany,
primarily through offering employees early retirement benefits under an
existing employee benefit arrangement. As a result of this arrangement,
Ticona recorded a charge of $7 million in 2003.

Also in 2003,
based on a 2002 restructuring initiative to concentrate its European
manufacturing operations in Germany, Ticona ceased its manufacturing
operations in Telford, United Kingdom. This resulted in contract
termination costs and asset impairments totaling $7 million and
employee severance costs of $1 million in 2003. Through December 31,
2003, the total cost of the Telford shutdown through 2003 were $12
million.

The $6 million of income from favorable adjustments of
previously recorded restructuring reserves consisted of a $1 million
adjustment to the 2002 reserves, a $4 million adjustment to the 2001
reserves and a $1 million adjustment to the 1999 reserves. The
adjustment to the 2002 reserve related to lower than expected costs
related to the demolition of the GUR Bayport facility. The adjustment
to the 2001 reserve was primarily due to the lower than expected
decommissioning costs of the Mexican production facility. The
adjustment to the 1999 reserve was due to lower than expected payments
related to the closure of a former administrative facility in the
United States.

In 2002, the Predecessor recorded income from
special charges of $5 million, which consisted of $14 million of
restructuring charges, $10 million of income from favorable adjustments
to previously recorded restructuring reserves, $1 million of income
from reimbursements from third party site partners related to prior
year initiatives, and $8 million of income from other special charges.
The $14 million of restructuring charges included employee severance
costs of $8 million and plant and office closure costs of $6
million.

Project Focus, initiated in early 2001, set goals to
reduce trade working capital, limit capital expenditures and improve
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from
programs


to increase efficiency. Project Forward was
announced in August 2001 and initiated additional restructuring and
other measures to reduce costs and increase profitability. During 2002,
the Predecessor recorded employee severance charges of $8 million, of
which $3 million related to adjustments to the 2001 forward initiatives
and $4 million for streamlining efforts of production facilities in
Germany and the United States, and $1 million for employee severance
costs in the polyvinyl alcohol business.

Ticona recorded asset
impairments of $4 million in 2002 related to a decision in 2002 to
shutdown operations in Telford, United Kingdom in 2003. In addition,
with the construction of a new and expanded GUR plant in Bishop, Texas,
the GUR operations in Bayport, Texas were transferred to a new
facility. Decommissioning and demolition costs associated with the
Bayport closure were $2 million.

The $10 million of favorable
adjustments of previously recorded restructuring reserves consisted of
an $8 million adjustment to the 2001 reserves and a $2 million
adjustment to the 2000 reserves. The 2001 adjustment was primarily due
to lower than expected personnel and closure costs associated with the
streamlining of chemical facilities in the United States, Canada, and
Germany. The 2000 adjustment was due to lower than expected demolition
costs for the Chemical Products production facility in Knapsack,
Germany. The other special charges income of $8 million related to a
reduction in reserves associated with settlements of environmental
indemnification obligations associated with former Hoechst
entities.

Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss)

Foreign
exchange gain (loss) decreased to a loss of $4 million in 2003 from a
gain of $3 million in 2002. This change is primarily attributable to
the strengthening of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar against the
U.S. dollar.

Operating Profit

Operating profit
declined to $118 million in 2003 compared to $173 million in 2002. The
favorable effects of higher selling prices primarily in the Chemical
Products segment, favorable currency movements, cost reductions, and
income from insurance recoveries of $107 million in the Ticona segment,
were offset by expenses of $95 million in the Performance Products
segment related to antitrust matters, $12 million of organizational
redesign costs at Ticona, increased stock appreciation rights expense
as well as higher raw material and energy costs in most segments. Stock
appreciation rights expense for 2003 was $59 million compared to $3
million in 2002. CAG streamlined its manufacturing operations, mainly
in the Chemical Products and Ticona segments and, as a result, recorded
termination benefit expenses, in cost of sales, of $26 million,
primarily in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Equity in Net
Earnings of Affiliates

Equity in net earnings of affiliates
increased to $35 million in 2003 from $21 million in 2002. This
increase was mainly attributable to an increase in the earnings from
the Polyplastics venture, an investment held by the Ticona segment,
partly due to growth in the Chinese and Taiwanese economies in 2003.
Cash distributions from equity affiliates were $23 million in 2003
compared to $100 million in 2002.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased by 11% to $49 million in 2003 from
$55 million in 2002. This decrease is primarily related to currency
translation effects and lower interest rates as well as lower average
debt levels.

Interest Income

Interest income
increased by $26 million to $44 million in 2003 compared to 2002,
primarily due to interest income associated with insurance recoveries
of $20 million in the Ticona segment.

Other Income
(Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net increased to $48
million in 2003 from $23 million in 2002, mainly due to income of $18
million resulting from the demutualization of an insurance provider and
an increase in


dividend income. These increases were
partially offset by expense of $14 million related to the unfavorable
currency effects on the unhedged position of intercompany net
receivables denominated in U.S. dollars. Investments accounted for
under the cost method contributed dividend income of $53 million and
$35 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2003
primarily resulted from higher dividends from the Saudi Arabian cost
investment on higher methanol pricing, which were slightly offset by
lower dividend income from the Acetate Products cost investments in
China, where earnings are being reinvested for capacity expansions.

Income Taxes

CAG recognized income tax expense of
$53 million in 2003 compared to $57 million in 2002.

The
effective tax rate for CAG in 2003 was 27 percent compared to 32
percent in 2002. In comparison to the German statutory rate, the 2003
effective tax rate was favorably affected by unrepatriated low-taxed
earnings, favorable settlement of prior year (1996) taxes in the U.S.,
equity earnings from Polyplastics, which are excluded from U.S. taxable
income and utilization of a U.S. capital loss carryforward that had
been subject to a valuation allowance. The effective tax rate was
unfavorably affected in 2003 by dividend distributions from
subsidiaries and writedowns of certain German corporate and trade tax
benefits related to prior years.

In comparison to the German
statutory rate, the effective tax rate in 2002 was favorably affected
by the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards in
Germany, the release of certain valuation allowances on prior
years' deferred tax assets, unrepatriated low-taxed earnings and
a lower effective minimum tax burden in Mexico. The effective tax rate
was unfavorably affected in 2002 by distributions of taxable dividends
from certain equity investments and the reversal of a tax-deductible
writedown in 2000 of a German investment.

Earnings
(Loss) from Discontinued Operations

In September 2003, CAG and
Dow reached an agreement for Dow to purchase the acrylates business of
CAG. This transaction was completed in February 2004 and the sales
price was $149 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $14
million. Dow acquired CAG's acrylates business line, including
inventory, intellectual property and technology for crude acrylic acid,
glacial acrylic acid, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, methyl acrylate
and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, as well as acrylates production assets at
the Clear Lake, Texas facility. In related agreements, the Company will
provide certain contract manufacturing services to Dow, and Dow will
supply acrylates to the Company AG for use in its emulsions production.
Simultaneously with the sale, CAG repaid an unrelated obligation of $95
million to Dow. The acrylates business was part of the chemical
business. As a result of this transaction, the assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses related to the acrylates product lines at the
Clear Lake, Texas facility are reflected as a component of discontinued
operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
SFAS No. 144.

In December 2003, the Ticona segment completed the
sale of its nylon business line to BASF. Ticona received cash proceeds
of $10 million and recorded a gain of $3 million.

In 2003, CAG
recorded a $1 million loss from operations of discontinued operations
related to the acrylates and nylon business divestitures. In 2003, CAG
also recorded adjustments related to prior year discontinued operations
representing a gain of $4 million.

In December 2002, CAG
completed the sale of Trespaphan, its global oriented polypropylene
("OPP") film business, to a consortium
consisting of Dor-Moplefan Group and Bain Capital, Inc. for a value of
$214 million. Net of the purchase price adjustments of $19 million and
the repayment of $80 million in intercompany debt that Trespaphan owed
CAG, CAG received net proceeds of $115 million. Trespaphan was formerly
part the Performance Products segment.

During 2002, CAG sold its
global allylamines and U.S. alkylamines businesses to U.S. Amines Ltd.
These businesses were part of the chemicals business.

In 2002,
CAG received net proceeds of $106 million and recorded a pre-tax gain
of $14 million on the disposal of discontinued operations relating to
these divestitures. Pre-tax earnings from operations of


discontinued operations in 2002 were $1
million. CAG recognized a tax benefit of $40 million for discontinued
operations, which includes a tax benefit associated with a tax
deductible writedown of the tax basis for Trespaphan's subsidiary
in Germany relating to tax years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
Since this tax benefit related to an entity solely engaged in a
business designated as discontinued operations, this tax benefit has
been correspondingly included in earnings (loss) from discontinued
operations.

The following table summarizes the results of the
discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002.

Cumulative
Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles

CAG recorded $1
million loss in a cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles, net of tax, on January 1, 2003, related to the adoption of
SFAS No. 143. CAG recognized transition amounts for existing asset
retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalized costs and
accumulated depreciation. The ongoing amortization expense on an annual
basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not
material.

In 2002, CAG recorded income of $18 million for the
cumulative effect of two changes in accounting principles, net of tax
of $5 million. The adoption of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, in 2002 resulted in income of $9 million, as it
required unamortized negative goodwill (excess of fair value over cost)
on the balance sheet to be written off immediately and classified as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated
statement of operations. Additionally, in 2002 CAG changed the
actuarial measurement date for its U.S. pension and other
postretirement benefit plans from September 30 to December 31. As this
change was accounted for as a change in accounting principle, a
cumulative effect adjustment of income of $9, net of taxes of $5
million, was recorded in 2002.

Net Earnings

As a
result of the factors mentioned above, the net earnings of CAG
decreased by $20 million to net earnings of $148 million in 2003
compared to $168 million in 2002.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Cash Flows

Net Cash Provided by/Used in Operating
Activities

Cash flow from operating activities decreased to a
cash outflow of $170 million for 2004 compared to a cash inflow of $401
million for 2003. This decrease primarily resulted from $473 million of
pension contributions, which are $343 million more than 2003.
Additionally, lower income from insurance recoveries, the payment of a
$95 million obligation to a third party, as well as payments of $59
million associated with the exercising of stock appreciation rights in
2004 also contributed to this decrease. These


outflows were partially offset by a decline
in payments associated with bonuses and income taxes as well as lower
cash consumed through changes in trade receivables and trade payables.
The hedging of foreign currency net receivables, primarily
intercompany, resulted in $17 million cash inflow in 2004 compared to a
$180 million inflow in 2003. Unfavorable foreign currency effects on
the euro versus the U.S. dollar on cash and cash equivalents increased
to $24 million in 2004.

Net cash provided by operating
activities increased by $38 million to $401 million in 2003 as compared
to 2002 primarily due to insurance recoveries of $120 million, plus
interest, offset by higher net taxes paid of $143 million and lower
dividends from equity investments of $41 million. In addition, higher
contributions were made to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension
plan of $130 million in 2003 compared to $100 million in 2002. The
hedging activity of foreign currency denominated intercompany net
receivables served to partially offset unfavorable currency effects on
net earnings of $155 million and resulted in a $180 million cash inflow
in 2003 compared to $95 million in 2002 due to the timing of
settlements of these contracts.

Net Cash Used in
Investing Activities

Net cash from investing activities
decreased to a cash outflow of $1,714 million in 2004 compared to a
cash outflow of $275 million in 2003. The increased cash outflow
primarily resulted from the acquisition of CAG. This increase was
partially offset by higher net proceeds received from disposals of
discontinued operations of $129 million and lower cash outflows related
to higher net purchases of marketable securities of $22 million.

Capital expenditures decreased by $1 million to $210 million in
2004. Spending in 2004 primarily related to a new Ticona research and
administrative facility in Florence, Kentucky, the expansion of
production facilities for polyacetal in Bishop, Texas and GUR in
Oberhausen, Germany, major replacements of equipment, capacity
expansions, major investments to reduce future operating costs,
environmental, health and safety initiatives and the integration of a
company-wide SAP platform. Spending in 2003 primarily related to the
completion of a production facility for synthesis gas, a primary raw
material at the Oberhausen site in Germany, major replacements of
equipment, capacity expansions, major investments to reduce future
operating costs, environmental, health and safety initiatives and the
integration of a company-wide SAP platform.

The increase in cash
outflows of $136 million in 2003 compared to 2002 is mainly due to
lower proceeds from disposal of discontinued operations of $196 million
and the receipt of $39 million in returns of capital from investments
in non-consolidated InfraServ companies in 2002. This increase in cash
outflow for 2003 was partially offset by a $131 million cash outflow
for the 2002 purchase of the net assets of the emulsions businesses.
Additionally, net cash outflows increased by $41 million related to
higher net purchases of marketable securities.

Capital
expenditures increased by $8 million to $211 million in 2003, primarily
due to foreign currency effects. Spending in 2003 primarily related to
the completion of a production facility for synthesis gas, a primary
raw material at the Oberhausen site in Germany, major replacements of
equipment, capacity expansions, major investments to reduce future
operating costs, environmental, health and safety initiatives and the
integration of a company-wide SAP platform. The spending in 2002
included the start of construction of the synthesis gas production
facility at the Oberhausen site. In addition, major projects included
the completion of a new GUR plant at the Bishop, Texas, facility and
the capacity expansion for Vectra at Shelby, North Carolina. The Vectra
expansion was built to supply the projected long-term demand of the
telecommunications industry and to develop and grow emerging
markets.

Net Cash Provided by/Used in Financing
Activities

Net cash from financing activities increased to a
cash inflow of $2,643 million in 2004 compared to a cash outflow of
$108 million in 2003. The increased cash inflow primarily reflects
higher net proceeds from borrowings in connection with the acquisition
of CAG and borrowings to prefund benefit obligations. These increased
cash inflows were partially offset by a $500 million return of capital
to the Original Shareholders. Refer to the Liquidity section below for
additional information.

Net cash used in financing activities
declined by $42 million to an outflow of $108 million in 2003 compared
to 2002. This decrease is primarily related to lower net payments of
short-term borrowings of


$121 million, offset by net payments of
long-term debt in 2003 of $48 million. In addition, in 2003, Celanese
AG paid a cash dividend of $25 million and repurchased 749,848 of its
shares, to be held in treasury, for approximately $15 million. Net cash
used in financing activities in 2002 was primarily due to net debt
repayments aggregating $144 million. In addition, Celanese AG
repurchased 284,798 of its shares, to be held in treasury, for
approximately $6 million.

Liquidity

The primary
source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations, which
included cash inflows from currency hedging activities. Historically,
the primary liquidity requirements were for capital expenditures,
working capital, pension contributions and investments. Our contractual
obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next
several years are significant and are substantially higher than
historical amounts. Our primary source of liquidity will continue to be
cash generated from operations as well as existing cash on hand. We
have availability under our amended and restated credit facilities to
assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other
contractual obligations.

We believe we will have available
resources to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity
requirements, including debt service. If our cash flow from operations
is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may
be forced to use other means available to us such as to increase our
borrowings under our lines of credit, reduce or delay capital
expenditures, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or
refinance our indebtedness.

In January 2005, we completed an
initial public offerings of Series A common stock and received net
proceeds of approximately $760 million. Concurrently, the Company
received net proceeds of $233 million from the offering of its
convertible preferred stock. A portion of the proceeds of the share
offerings were used to redeem $188 million of senior discount notes and
$521 million of senior subordinated notes, which excludes premiums of
$19 million and $51 million, respectively.

Subsequent to the
closing of the initial public offering, we borrowed an additional
$1,135 million under the senior credit facilities, which were amended
and restated in January 2005; a portion of which was used to repay a
$350 million floating rate term loan, which excludes premiums of $3
million, and $200 million was primarily used to finance the acquisition
of the Vinamul emulsion business. Additionally, the amended and
restated senior credit facilities include a $242 million delayed draw
term loan which is expected to be used to finance the Acetex
acquisition.

On April 7, 2005, we expect to use the remaining
proceeds to pay a special cash dividend to holders of the
Company's Series B common stock of $804 million, which was
declared on March 8, 2005. Upon payment of the $804 million dividend,
the shares of Celanese Series B common stock convert automatically to
shares of Celanese Series A common stock. In addition, we may use the
available sources of liquidity to purchase the remaining outstanding
shares of Celanese AG.

As a result of the offerings in January
2005, we now have $240 million aggregate liquidation preference of
outstanding preferred stock. Holders of the preferred stock are
entitled to receive, when, as and if, declared by our board of
directors, out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends at
the rate of 4.25% per annum (or $1.06 per share) of liquidation
preference, payable quarterly in arrears, commencing on May 1, 2005.
Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of
initial issuance. This dividend is expected to result in an annual
dividend payment of approximately $10 million. Accumulated but unpaid
dividends accumulate at an annual rate of 4.25%. The preferred
stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time into
shares of our Series A common stock at a conversion rate of shares of
our Series A common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference of the
preferred stock.

Our board of directors currently intends to
adopt a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a
quarterly cash dividend on each share of our Series A common stock at
an annual rate initially equal to approximately 0.75% of the
$16.00 initial public offering price per share of our Series A common
stock (or $0.12 per share) unless our board of directors in its sole
discretion determines otherwise, commencing the second quarter of 2005.
Based upon the number of oustanding shares after the initial


public offering, the common stock dividend
declared on March 8, 2005 and the conversion as mentioned above, the
anticipated annual cash dividend payment is approximately $19 million.
However, there is no assurance that sufficient cash or surplus will be
available to pay such dividend.

As of December 31, 2004, we had
total debt of $3,387 million and cash and cash equivalents of $838
million. In connection with the acquisition of CAG, we incurred a
substantial amount of debt. We entered into senior subordinated bridge
loans and issued $200 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
shares, both of which were subsequently refinanced by the senior
subordinated notes and the floating rate term loan. Additionally, we
issued senior discount notes and additional senior subordinated notes
as well as entered into senior credit facilities.

In connection
with the CAG acquisition, the Company cancelled its committed
commercial paper backup facilities and revolving credit facilities.
Additionally, we agreed to pre-fund $463 million of certain pension
obligations, which is expected to eliminate the need for future funding
for seven to ten years. As of December 31, 2004, $409 million was
pre-funded, and in February 2005 we contributed an additional $42
million to the non-qualified pension plan's rabbi trusts. We
terminated our $120 million trade receivable securitization program in
February 2005, which was unavailable since the CAG acquisition and had
no outstanding sales of receivables as of December 31, 2004.

During the nine months ended December 31, 2004, we repaid
approximately $235 million of CAG's variable rate debt that was
originally scheduled to mature in 2005, 2008 and 2009.

We were
initially capitalized by equity contributions totaling $641 million
from the Original Shareholders. On a stand alone basis, Celanese
Corporation and Crystal US Holdings 3 LLC ("Crystal
LLC"), the issuer of the senior discount notes, have no
material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries that they
own, and no independent external operations of their own apart from the
financing. As such, Celanese Corporation and Crystal LLC generally will
depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries to meet their
obligations, including their obligations under the preferred stock, the
senior discount notes, senior subordinated notes, term loans and any
revolving credit borrowings and guarantees.

In March 2005, the
Company received $75 million for an early contractual settlement of
receivables related to the 2000 sale of CAG's 50% interest
in the Vinnolit Kunstoff GmbH venture. The Company has receivables
related to this settlement as of December 31, 2004, which was recorded
in the allocation of the purchase price of CAG.

Domination
Agreement.

At the Celanese AG annual shareholders' meeting on
June 15, 2004, Celanese AG shareholders approved payment of a dividend
on the CAG Shares for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 of
€0.12 per share. For the nine month fiscal year ended on
September 30, 2004, Celanese AG will not be able to pay a dividend to
its shareholders due to losses incurred in the Celanese AG statutory
accounts. Accordingly, in the near term, Celanese Corporation, Crystal
LLC and BCP Crystal US Holdings Corp ("BCP
Crystal"), which issued the senior subordinated notes and
term loans, will use existing cash and borrowings from their
subsidiaries, subject to various restrictions, including restrictions
imposed by the senior credit facilities and indentures and by relevant
provisions of German and other applicable laws, to make interest
payments. If the Domination Agreement ceases to be operative, the
ability of Celanese Corporation and BCP Crystal to meet their
obligations will be materially and adversely affected.

The
Domination Agreement was approved at the Celanese AG extraordinary
shareholders' meeting on July 31, 2004. The Domination Agreement
between Celanese AG and the Purchaser became effective on
October  1, 2004. When the Domination Agreement became effective,
the Purchaser was obligated to offer to acquire all outstanding CAG
Shares from the minority shareholders of Celanese AG in return for
payment of fair cash compensation. This offer will continue until two
months following the date on which the decision on the last motion in
award proceedings (

Spruchverfahren

) as described in
"Legal Proceedings—Shareholder
Litigation", has been disposed of and has been published.
These award proceedings were dismissed in 2005; however, the dismissal
is still subject to appeal. The amount of this fair cash compensation
has been determined to be €41.92 per share, plus interest,
in accordance with applicable German law. Any minority shareholder who
elects not to sell their shares to the Purchaser will


be entitled to remain a shareholder of
Celanese AG and to receive from the Purchaser a gross guaranteed fixed
annual payment on their shares of €3.27 per CAG Share less
certain corporate taxes in lieu of any future dividend. Taking into
account the circumstances and the tax rates at the time of entering
into the Domination Agreement, the net guaranteed fixed annual payment
is €2.89 per share for a full fiscal year. Based upon the
number of CAG Shares held by the minority shareholders as of December
31, 2004, a net guaranteed fixed annual payment of €23
million is expected. The net guaranteed fixed annual payment may,
depending on applicable corporate tax rates, in the future be higher,
lower or the same as €2.89. If the Purchaser acquires all
CAG Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2004, the total amount of
funds necessary to purchase such remaining outstanding shares would be
at least €334 million plus accrued interest from October
2, 2004.

While the Domination Agreement is operative, the
Purchaser is required to compensate Celanese AG for any statutory
annual loss incurred by Celanese AG, the dominated entity at the end of
its fiscal year when the loss was incurred. If the Purchaser were
obligated to make cash payments to Celanese AG to cover an annual loss,
the Purchaser may not have sufficient funds to pay interest when due
and, unless the Purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other
than annual profits of Celanese AG, the Purchaser may not be able to
satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall. The Domination Agreement
cannot be terminated by the Purchaser in the ordinary course until
September 30, 2009.

Our subsidiaries, BCP Caylux Holdings
Luxembourg S.C.A. and BCP Crystal, have each agreed to provide the
Purchaser with financing to strengthen the Purchaser's ability to
fulfill its obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
Agreement and to ensure that the Purchaser will perform all of its
obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination Agreement when
such obligations become due, including, without limitation, the
obligations to make a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the
outstanding minority shareholders, to offer to acquire all outstanding
CAG Shares from the minority shareholders in return for payment of fair
cash consideration and to compensate Celanese AG for any statutory
annual loss incurred by Celanese AG during the term of the Domination
Agreement. If BCP Caylux and/or BCP Crystal are obligated to make
payments under such guarantees or other security to the Purchaser
and/or the minority shareholders, we may not have sufficient funds for
payments on our indebtedness when due.

In the first quarter of
2005, the Company paid $10 million to affiliates of the Blackstone
Group related to an advisor monitoring agreement. This agreement was
terminated concurrent with the initial public offering and resulted in
an additional $35 million payment.

Contractual
Obligations.

The following table sets forth our fixed
contractual debt obligations as of December 31, 2004, on a pro forma
basis, after giving effect to additional borrowings under the term loan
facility of $1,135 million and repayments of $521 million of the senior
subordinated notes, $188 million of the senior discount notes and the
$350 million floating rate term loan which excludes premiums of $51
million, $19 million and $3 million, respectively.

(1)

Excludes
the following: $242 million of delayed draw term loans which will be
used to finance the Acetex acquisition and cash interest obligations on
debt, excluding the senior discount notes and any commitment and
facility fees, of approximately $208 million in the next year, $390
million in years two to three, $385 million in years four to five and
$1,031 million after five years. Interest payments on the term loan
facility, which has a variable interest rate, were calculated using an
assumed rate of 5.00% for all periods. No cash interest is
payable on the senior discount notes in years one to five and $288
million cash interest is payable after five years.

(2)

Does not include $4 million of premium on the
$225 million of the senior subordinated notes issued July 1,
2004.


(3)

Reflects the
accreted value of the notes at maturity.

(4)

Does not include $2 million purchase
accounting adjustment to assumed debt.

Senior Credit
Facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, the senior credit
facilities of $1,232 million consist of a term loan facility, a
revolving credit facility, and a credit-linked revolving facility.

The term loan facility consists of commitments of $454 million and
€125 million, both maturing in 2011. As of December 31,
2004, we borrowed $624 million (including €125 million)
under the term loan facility.

The revolving credit facility,
through a syndication of banks, provides for borrowings of up to $380
million, including the availability of letters of credit in U.S.
dollars and euros and for borrowings on same-day notice. As of December
31, 2004, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit
facility, which matures in 2009.

Subsequent to the consummation
of the initial public offering in January 2005, we entered into amended
and restated senior credit facilities. The terms of the amended and
restated senior credit facilities are substantially similar to the
terms of our existing senior credit facilities. Under the amended and
restated facilities the term loan facility increased to $1,759 million
(including €275 million). In addition, there is a new $242
million delayed draw facility which when drawn will be added to the
existing term loan facility. We expect to use this delayed draw
facility to finance the acquisition of Acetex.

Also in January
2005, the revolving credit facility was increased from $380 million to
$600 million under the amended and restated senior credit facilities.
The $228 million credit-linked revolving facility, which matures in
2009, includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit. As
of December 31, 2004, there were $207 million of letters of credit
issued under the credit-linked revolving facility. As of December 31,
2004, $401 million remained available for borrowing under the revolving
credit facilities (taking into account letters of credit issued under
the revolving credit facilities).

Substantially all of the
assets of Celanese Holdings LLC ("Celanese
Holdings"), the direct parent of BCP Crystal, and, subject
to certain exceptions, substantially all of its existing and future
U.S. subsidiaries, referred to as U.S. Guarantors, secure these
facilities. The borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear
interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at the
borrower's option, either a base rate or a LIBOR rate. The
applicable margin for borrowing under the base rate option is
1.50% and for the LIBOR option, 2.50% (in each case,
subject to a step-down based on a performance test).

The senior
credit facilities are subject to prepayment requirements and contain
covenants, defaults and other provisions. The senior credit facilities
require BCP Crystal to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to
certain exceptions, with:

- 75% (such percentage will be
reduced to 50% if BCP Crystal's leverage ratio is less
than 3.00 to 1.00 for any fiscal year ending on or after December 31,
2005) of BCP Crystal's excess cash flow;

- 100% of
the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales and
casualty and condemnation events, unless BCP Crystal reinvests or
contracts to reinvest those proceeds in assets to be used in BCP
Crystal's business or to make certain other permitted investments
within 12 months, subject to certain limitations;

- 100%
of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt other than debt
permitted under the senior credit facilities, subject to certain
exceptions; and

- 50% of the net cash proceeds of
issuances of equity of Celanese Holdings, subject to certain
exceptions.

BCP Crystal may voluntarily repay outstanding loans
under the senior credit facility at any time without premium or
penalty, other than customary "breakage"
costs with respect to LIBOR loans.

In connection with the
borrowing by BCP Crystal under the term loan portion of the senior
credit facilities, BCP Crystal and CAC have entered into an
intercompany loan agreement whereby BCP Crystal has agreed to lend the
proceeds from any borrowings under its term loan facility to CAC. The
intercompany loan agreement contains the same amortization provisions
as the senior credit facilities. The interest rate with respect to the
loans made under the intercompany loan agreement is the same as the


interest rate with respect to the loans
under BCP Crystal's term loan facility plus three basis points.
BCP Crystal intends to service the indebtedness under its term loan
facility with the proceeds of payments made to it by CAC under the
intercompany loan agreement.

Floating Rate Term
Loan.

The $350 million floating rate term loan matures in
2011. The borrowings under the floating rate term loan bear interest at
a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at BCP Crystal's
option, either a base rate or a LIBOR rate. Prior to the completion of
the Restructuring, the applicable margin for borrowings under the base
rate option was 3.25% and for the LIBOR option, 4.25%.
Subsequent to the completion of the Restructuring, the applicable
margin for borrowings under the base rate option is 2.50% and
for the LIBOR option, 3.50%. The floating rate term loan accrues
interest. We used a portion of new borrowings under the amended and
restated senior credit facilities to repay the floating rate term loan
and $3 million of associated premium in January 2005.

Senior
Subordinated Notes.

The senior subordinated notes consist of
$1,225 million of 9 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and
€200 million of 10 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2014. From the completion of the Restructuring, all of BCP
Crystal's U.S. domestic, wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee
BCP Crystal's obligations under the senior credit facilities
guarantee the senior subordinated notes on an unsecured senior
subordinated basis. In February 2005, we used approximately $521
million of the net proceeds of the offering of our Series A common
stock to redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and $51
million to pay the premium associated with the redemption.

Senior Discount Notes.

In September 2004, Crystal LLC
and Crystal US Sub 3 Corp., a subsidiary of Crystal LLC, issued $853
million aggregate principal amount at maturity of their senior discount
notes due 2014 consisting of $163 million principal amount at maturity
of their 10% Series A senior discount notes due 2014 and $690
million principal amount at maturity of their 10 1/2% Series B
Senior Discount Notes due 2014 (collectively, the "senior
discount notes"). The gross proceeds of the offering were
$513 million. Approximately $500 million of the proceeds were
distributed to the Company's Original Shareholders, with the
remaining proceeds used to pay fees associated with the refinancing.
Until October 1, 2009, interest on the senior discount notes will
accrue in the form of an increase in the accreted value of such notes.
Cash interest on the senior discount notes will accrue commencing on
October 1, 2009 and be payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and
October 1. In February 2005, we used approximately $37 million of the
net proceeds of the offering of our Series A common stock to redeem a
portion of the Series A senior discount notes and $151 million to
redeem a portion of the Series B senior discount notes and $19 million
to pay the premium associated with such redemption.

Assumed
Debt.

As a result of the acquisition of CAG, the Company
prepaid, in April 2004, $175 million of debt scheduled to mature in
2005 and 2008 and, in September 2004, prepaid approximately $60 million
of additional debt previously scheduled to mature in 2009. The
outstanding assumed debt of $383 million, which includes a $2 million
reduction under purchase accounting, is primarily made up of fixed rate
pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, short-term borrowings
from affiliated companies and capital lease obligations.

Covenants.

The indentures governing the senior
subordinated notes and the senior discount notes limit the ability of
the issuers of such notes and the ability of their restricted
subsidiaries to:

•

incur additional
indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

•

pay dividends on or make other
distributions or repurchase the respective issuer's capital
stock;

•

make certain investments;

•

enter into certain transactions with
affiliates;

•

limit dividends or other
payments by BCP Crystal's restricted subsidiaries to it;

•

create liens or other pari passu or
subordinated indebtedness without securing the respective
notes;

•

designate subsidiaries as
unrestricted subsidiaries; and

•

sell
certain assets or merge with or into other companies.


Subject to certain exceptions, the
indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior
discount notes permit the issuers of the notes and their restricted
subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, including secured
indebtedness.

The senior credit facilities contain a number of
covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain
exceptions, the ability of Celanese Holdings and its
subsidiaries' ability, to:

•

sell
assets;

•

incur additional indebtedness or
issue preferred stock;

•

repay other
indebtedness (including the notes);

•

pay
dividends and distributions or repurchase their capital
stock;

•

create liens on
assets;

•

make investments, loans
guarantees or advances;

•

make certain
acquisitions;

•

engage in mergers or
consolidations;

•

enter into sale and
leaseback transactions;

•

engage in
certain transactions with
affiliates;

•

amend certain material
agreements governing BCP Crystal's
indebtedness;

•

change the business
conducted by Celanese Holdings and its subsidiaries; and

•

enter into hedging agreements that restrict
dividends from subsidiaries.

In addition, the senior credit
facilities require BCP Crystal to maintain the following financial
covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum bank debt leverage
ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum capital
expenditures limitation.

A breach of covenants of the senior
credit facilities as of December 31, 2004 that are tied to ratios based
on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreements, could result
in a default under the senior credit facilities and the lenders could
elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Any such
acceleration would also result in a default under the indentures
governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes.
Additionally, under the senior credit facilities, the floating rate
term loan and the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes
and the senior discount notes, our ability to engage in activities such
as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying
dividends is also tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA. As of
December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with these covenants. The
maximum consolidated net bank debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, previously
required under the senior credit facilities, was eliminated when we
amended the facilities in January 2005.


Covenant levels and ratios for the four
quarters ended December 31, 2004 are as follows:

(1)

The
senior credit facilities require BCP Crystal to maintain an Adjusted
EBITDA to cash interest ratio starting at a minimum of 1.7x for the
period April 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, 1.8x for the period January
1, 2006 to December 31, 2006, 1.85x for the period January 1, 2007 to
December 31, 2007 and 2.0x thereafter. Failure to satisfy these ratio
requirements would constitute a default under the senior credit
facilities. If lenders under the senior credit facilities failed to
waive any such default, repayment obligations under the senior credit
facilities could be accelerated, which would also constitute a default
under the indenture.

(2)

BCP
Crystal's ability to incur additional debt and make certain
restricted payments under the senior subordinated note indenture,
subject to specified exceptions, is tied to an Adjusted EBITDA to fixed
charge ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.

(3)

Crystal LLC's ability to incur
additional debt and make certain restricted payments under the senior
discount notes indenture, subject to specified exceptions, is tied to
an Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charge ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.

Adjusted EBITDA is used to determine compliance with many of the
covenants contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes
and in the senior credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and all of its
component elements are defined in our debt agreements and include
non-U.S. GAAP measures and terms that are the same as U.S. GAAP
measures which are not determined on the same basis as U.S. GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude
unusual items, non-cash items and other adjustments permitted in
calculating covenant compliance under our indentures and senior credit
facilities, as shown in the table below. We believe that the disclosure
of the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information that is
useful to an investor's understanding of our liquidity and
financial flexibility.

Adjusted EBITDA as calculated under our
senior credit facilities and the indentures for the senior subordinated
notes and the senior discount notes for the four quarters ended
December 31, 2004 is as follows:


(1)

Includes
$55 million (plus an additional $15 million for the senior credit
facilities and the senior subordinated notes) of interest expense, $3
million of foreign currency expense recorded in other income (expense),
net and $7 million elimination of intercompany interest
income.

(2)

Special charges include
provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred
outside the normal ongoing course of operations. Restructuring
provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit
programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally
redesign the business operations, as well as costs incurred in
connection with a decision to exit non-strategic businesses. These
measures are based on formal management decisions, establishment of
agreements with the employees' representatives or individual
agreements with the affected employees, as well as the public
announcement of the restructuring plan. The related reserves reflect
certain estimates, including those pertaining to separation costs,
settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs. We
reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan
under existing restructuring programs at the end of each reporting
period. Actual experience may be different from these estimates. See
Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Consists of the following: $50 management
compensation program, $26 million of foreign currency expense on
intercompany loans and swaps; $21 million of transaction costs; $7
million of employee contract termination expense; $1 million of stock
appreciation rights expense; and $2 million of income, net for other
miscellaneous non-recurring items.


(4)

Included in
the amount above is $53 million of expense relating to our inventory
step-up under purchase accounting; $9 million of amortization expense
included in net periodic pension and OPEB cost; $1 million of expense
associated with Celanese AG's stock option plan; and a change in
swap valuation of $11 million. Items that were zero for the applicable
period but are required to be included per our financing agreements,
are any reimbursed expenses and any non-cash portion of rent
expenses.

(5)

Our financing
agreements require us to make other adjustments to net earnings (loss)
for net gain on disposition of assets and advisor fees paid to an
affiliates of the Blackstone Group. Gain (loss) on extinguishment of
debt was zero for the applicable period but are required to be included
per our financing agreements.

(6)

Our financing agreements also permit
adjustments to net earnings (loss) on a pro forma basis for certain
cost savings that we expect to achieve. We expect annual cost savings
of approximately $37 million from pension pre-funding (of which $7
million is reflected in the Successor's actual results) and
approximately $2 million from lower costs associated with publicly
listed equity in Germany.

Consolidated net debt, a required
measure for covenant compliance purposes and its components are defined
in our credit agreements as total indebtedness, consisting of borrowed
money and the deferred purchase price of property or services plus net
cash for receivables financing less unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents of our subsidiary Celanese Holdings LLC and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Consolidated net debt is
calculated as follows as of December 31, 2004:

Contractual
Obligations.

The following table sets forth our fixed
contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2004.

(1)

Does
not include $2 million purchase accounting adjustment to assumed
debt.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company paid $10
million to affiliates of the Blackstone Group related to an advisor
monitoring agreement. This agreement was terminated concurrent with the
initial public offering and resulted in an additional $35 million
termination payment. Based upon the number of CAG Shares held by the
minority shareholders as of December 31, 2004, a net guaranteed fixed
annual payment of €23 million is expected. These amounts
are excluded from the above table.

Unconditional Purchase
Obligations include take or pay contracts and fixed price forward
contracts. The Company does not expect to incur any material losses
under these contractual arrangements. In addition, these contracts may
include variable price components.

Other Contractual Obligations
primarily includes committed capital spending and fines associated with
the U.S. antitrust settlement described in Note 27 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Included in Other Contractual Obligations is a
€99 million ($135 million) fine from the European
Commission


related to antitrust matters in the sorbates
industry, which is pending an appeal. The Company is indemnified by a
third party for 80% of the expenses relating to these matters,
which is not reflected in the amount above.

At December 31,
2004, the Company has contractual guarantees and commitments as
follows:

The
Company is secondarily liable under a lease agreement pursuant to which
the Company has assigned a direct obligation to a third party. The
lease assumed by the third party expires on April 30, 2012. The lease
liability for the period from January 1, 2005 to April 30, 2012 is
estimated to be approximately $55 million.

Standby letters of
credit of $212 million at December 31, 2004 are irrevocable obligations
of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event
that certain Successor subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with
specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that
material payments will be required under these agreements. The stand-by
letters of credit include $207 million issued under the credit-linked
revolving facility of which approximately $28 million relates to
obligations associated with the sorbates antitrust matters as described
in the "Other Contractual Obligations"
above.

For additional commitments and contingences, see Note 27
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company expects to
continue to incur costs for the following significant obligations.
Although, the Company cannot predict with certainty the annual spending
for these matters, such matters will affect future cash flows of the
Company.

Environmental
Matters

For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the
Successor's worldwide expenditures, including expenditures for
legal compliance, internal environmental initiatives and remediation of
active, orphan, divested and U.S. Superfund sites were $66 million. The
Predecessor's worldwide expenditures for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $22
million, $80 million and $83 million, respectively. The
Successor's capital project related environmental expenditures
for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, and the
Predecessor's for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, included in worldwide
expenditures, were $6 million, $2 million, $10 million and $4 million,
respectively. Environmental reserves for remediation matters were $143
million and $159 million as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
respectively. See Notes 14 and 15. As of December 31, 2004, the
estimated range for remediation costs is between $100 million and $143
million, with the best estimate of $143 million.

It is
anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will continue to
be imposed on the chemical industry in general. Management cannot
predict with certainty future environmental expenditures, especially
expenditures beyond 2005. Due to new air regulations in the U.S.,
management expects that


there will be a temporary increase in
compliance costs that will total approximately $30 million to $45
million through 2007. An additional $50 million may be needed depending
upon the outcome of a challenge in U.S. federal court related to key
portions of the regulation. In addition, a recent European Union
directive requires a trading system for carbon dioxide emissions to be
in place by January 1, 2005. Accordingly, Emission Trading Systems will
directly affect the power plants at the Kelsterbach and Oberhausen
sites in Germany and the Lanaken site in Belgium, as well as power
plants operated by InfraServ entities on sites at which we operate. The
Company and the InfraServ entities may be required to purchase carbon
dioxide credits, which could result in increased operating costs, or
may be required to develop additional cost-effective methods to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions further, which could result in increased
capital expenditures. Additionally, the new regulation indirectly
affects our other operations in the European Union, which may
experience higher energy costs from third party providers. We have not
yet determined the impact of this legislation on our operating
costs.

Due to its industrial history, the Company has the
obligation to remediate specific areas on its active sites as well as
on divested, orphan or U.S. Superfund sites. In addition, as part of
the demerger agreement with Hoechst, a specified proportion of the
responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of
pre-demerger divestitures was transferred to the Company. Management
has provided for such obligations when the event of loss is probable
and reasonably estimable. Management believes that the environmental
costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position
of the Company, but they may have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period. See
Note 19 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and Other Benefits

The funding policy for
pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run,
will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, three months ended March
31, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2003, pension
contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan
amounted to $300 million, $33 million and $130 million, respectively.
Contributions to the German pension plans for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 were $105 million. Also for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, three months ended March 31, 2004 and for the year
ended December 31, 2003, payments to other non-qualified plans totaled
$29 million, $6 million and $24 million, respectively.

Spending
by the Company associated with other benefit plans, primarily retiree
medical, defined contribution and long-term disability, amounted to $53
million, $9 million and $65 million for the nine months ended December
31, 2004, three months ended March 31, 2004 and for the year ended
December 31, 2003, respectively. See Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Plumbing Actions and Sorbates
Litigation

The Company is involved in a number of legal
proceedings and claims incidental to the normal conduct of its
business. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 there were net
cash inflows of zero in connection with the plumbing actions and
sorbates litigation. For the three months ended March 31, 2004 and for
the year ended December 31, 2003, there were net cash inflows of
approximately zero and $110 million in connection with the plumbing
actions and sorbates litigation. As of December 31, 2004, there were
reserves of $218 million for these matters. In addition, the Company
had receivables from insurance companies and Hoechst in connection with
the plumbing and sorbates matters of $191 million as of December 31,
2004.

Although it is impossible at this time to determine with
certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters, management believes,
based on the advice of legal counsel, that adequate provisions have
been made and that the ultimate outcome will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but could have
a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in
any given accounting period. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Capital Expenditures

The
Company's capital expenditures were $210 million for the calendar
year 2004. Capital expenditures primarily related to a new Ticona
research and administrative facility in Florence, Kentucky,


the expansion of production facilities for
polyacetal in Bishop, Texas and GUR in Oberhausen, Germany, major
replacements of equipment, capacity expansions, major investments to
reduce future operating costs, environmental, health and safety
initiatives and the integration of a company-wide SAP platform. Capital
expenditures remained below depreciation levels as management continued
to make selective capital investments to enhance the market positions
of its products.

Capital expenditures were financed principally
with cash from operations. Spending for 2005 is expected to be between
$210 million to $230 million. At December 31, 2004, there were
approximately $40 million of outstanding commitments related to capital
projects, which are included within the fixed contractual cash
obligations table above.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

We have not entered into any material
off-balance arrangements.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
151,

Inventory Costs, amendment to ARB No. 43 Chapter 4

, which
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151
is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The
Company is in the process of assessing the impact of SFAS No. 151 on
its future results of operations and financial position.

In
December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation

, which requires that the cost from all
share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial
statements. SFAS No. 123 (revised) is effective for the first interim
or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 123 (revised),
although it is anticipated that the adoption will have a negative
impact on results of operations.

In December  2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No.  153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an
amendment of APB Opinion No.  29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

. The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the
principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based
on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments
eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges
of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The
statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in
fiscal periods beginning after June  15, 2005. Earlier
application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in
fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance. The provisions of
this statement shall be applied prospectively. The Company is currently
evaluating the potential impact of this statement.

In October
2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
"Act") was signed into law. Three of the more
significant provisions of the Act relate to a one-time opportunity to
repatriate foreign earnings at a reduced rate, manufacturing benefits
for qualified production activity income and new requirements with
respect to deferred compensation plans. The Company has not yet
determined the impact, if any, of this Act on its future results of
operations or cash flows. Additionally, under new Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code, created in connection with the Act, the U.S.
Treasury Department is directed to issue regulations providing guidance
and provide a limited period during which deferred compensation plans
may be amended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. When
the regulations are issued, the Company may be required to make
modifications to certain compensation plans to comply with Section
409A.

Market Risks

We are exposed to market risk
through commercial and financial operations. Our market risk consists
principally of exposure to currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices. The Predecessor had in place policies of hedging
against changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices as described below. We adopted the Predecessor's
written policies regarding the use of derivative financial instruments.
Contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting


for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

amended by SFAS No. 138,

Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities

and SFAS No.
148,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

We and the Predecessor have receivables and payables denominated in
currencies other than the functional currencies of the various
subsidiaries, which create foreign exchange risk. For the purposes of
this document, the Predecessor's reporting currency is the U.S.
dollar, the reporting currency of Celanese AG continues to be the euro.
The U.S. dollar, the euro, Mexican peso, Japanese yen, British pound
sterling, and Canadian dollar are the most significant sources of
currency risk. Accordingly, we enter into foreign currency forwards and
swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The
foreign currency contracts are designated for recognized assets and
liabilities and forecasted transactions. The terms of these contracts
are generally under one year. Our centralized hedging strategy states
that foreign currency denominated receivables or liabilities recorded
by the operating entities will be internally hedged, only the remaining
net foreign exchange position will then be hedged externally with
banks. As a result, foreign currency forward contracts relating to this
centralized strategy did not meet the criteria of SFAS No. 133 to
qualify for hedge accounting. Net foreign currency transaction gains or
losses are recognized on the underlying transactions, which are offset
by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts.

On June  16, 2004, as part of its currency risk management,
the Company entered into a currency swap with certain financial
institutions. Under the terms of the swap arrangement, the Company will
pay approximately €13  million in interest and
receive approximately $16  million in interest on each
June  15 and December  15 (with interest for the first
period prorated). Upon maturity of the swap agreement on June
16, 2008, the Company will pay approximately €276
million and receive approximately $333  million. The Company
designated the swap, the euro term loan and a euro note as a net
investment hedge (for accounting purposes) in the fourth quarter of
2004. The loss related to the swap was $21 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004, of which $14 million is related to the
ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge. During the nine months
ended December 31, 2004, the effects of the swap resulted in an
increase in total liabilities and a decrease in shareholder's
equity of $57  million and $36  million, respectively.

Contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $288 million
and $765 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are
predominantly in U.S. dollars, British pound sterling, Japanese yen,
and Canadian dollars. Most of the Company's foreign currency
forward contracts did not meet the criteria of SFAS No. 133 to qualify
for hedge accounting. The Company recognizes net foreign currency
transaction gains or losses on the underlying transactions, which are
offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward
contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's
foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total
assets and an increase in total liabilities of $42 million and $2
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, these contracts, in
addition to natural hedges, hedged approximately 100% of the
Company's net receivables held in currencies other than the
entities' functional currency for the Company's European
operations. Related to the unhedged portion during the year, a net gain
(loss) of approximately ($2) million and $4 million from foreign
exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income (expense), net
for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended
March 31, 2004. During 2003, the Predecessor's foreign currency
forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets of $8 million
and an increase in total liabilities of $1 million. As of December 31,
2003, these contracts hedged a portion (approximately 85%) of
the Predecessor's U.S. dollar denominated intercompany net
receivables held by euro denominated entities. Related to the unhedged
portion, a net loss of approximately $14 million from foreign exchange
gains or losses was recorded to other income (expense), net in 2003.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Predecessor hedged all of
its U.S. dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro
denominated entities. Therefore, there was no material net effect from
foreign exchange gains or losses. Hedging activities primarily related
to intercompany net receivables yielded cash flows from operating
activities of approximately $17 million, $180 million and $95 million
for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, year ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.


A substantial portion of our assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollar, principally the euro. Fluctuations in the value of
these currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the value of the
euro, can have, and in the past have had, a direct and material impact
on the business and financial results. For example, a decline in the
value of the euro versus the U.S. dollar, results in a decline in the
U.S. dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and earnings due to
translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the euro
versus the U.S. dollar would result in an opposite effect. The Company
estimates that the translation effects of changes in the value of other
currencies against the U.S. dollar increased net sales by approximately
3% and increased total assets by approximately 3% for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004. The Predecessor estimated that the
translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against
the U.S. dollar increased net sales by approximately 6% for the
three months ended March 31, 2004 and by approximately 7% for
the year ended December 31, 2003 and by approximately 2% in
2002. The Predecessor also estimated that the translation effects of
changes in the value of other currencies against the U.S. dollar
decreased total assets by approximately 1% for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and approximately 5% in 2003. Exposure to
transactional effects is further reduced by a high degree of overlap
between the currencies in which sales are denominated and the
currencies in which the raw material and other costs of goods sold are
denominated.

As of December 31, 2004, we had total debt of
$3,387 million, of which approximately $610 million (€447
million) is euro denominated debt. A 1% increase in foreign
exchange rates would increase the euro denominated debt by $6
million.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The
Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the
exposure of interest rate risk inherent in the Company's
outstanding debt by locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired
level of fixed/floating rate debt depending on market conditions. At
December 31, 2004, the Successor had no interest rate swap agreements
in place. The Predecessor had open interest rate swaps with a notional
amount of $200 million at December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of
2004, the Successor recorded a loss of less than $1 million in other
income (expense), net associated with the early termination of its $200
million interest rate swap. During 2003, the Predecessor recorded a
loss of $7 million in other income (expense), net, associated with the
early termination of one of its interest rate swaps. The Successor
recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to
interest rate swaps of $1 million for the nine months ended December
31, 2004. The Predecessor recognized net interest expense from hedging
activities relating to interest rate swaps of $2 million, $11 million
and $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. During 2003, the Predecessor's
interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, resulted in a
decrease in total assets and total liabilities and an increase in
shareholders' equity of $4 million, $14 million and $7 million,
net of related income tax of $4 million, respectively. The Predecessor
recorded a net gain (loss) of less than ($1) million, $2 million and
($3) million in other income (expense), net of the ineffective portion
of the interest rate swaps, during the three months ended March 31,
2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

On a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$1,900 million of variable rate debt. A 1% increase in interest
rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $19
million.

Commodity Risk Management

The
Company's policy for the majority of our natural gas and butane
requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward
purchase or cash-settled swap contracts. Fixed price natural gas
forward contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of
the physical commodity. The maturities of the cash-settled swap
contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have
the effect of securing predetermined prices for the underlying
commodity. Although these contracts are structured to limit our
exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the
potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in
commodity prices. These cash-settled swap contracts are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. Realized gains and losses on these contracts are
included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract.
The Successor recognized losses of less than $1 million from natural
gas swaps and butane contracts for the nine months ended December 31,
2004. The


Predecessor recognized losses of $1 million,
$3 million and less than $1 million from natural gas swaps and butane
contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There was no material impact
on the balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. There
were no unrealized gains and losses associated with the cash-settled
swap contracts as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The
Company did not have any open commodity swaps as of December 31, 2004.
The Company had open swaps with a notional amount of $5 million as of
December 31, 2003.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on
the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The
preparation of these financial statements and application of these
policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably
likely events or circumstances that would result in materially
different results.

We believe the following accounting polices
and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting
risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and
the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to
understanding our reported and future operating results. See note 4 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more comprehensive
discussion of the significant accounting policies.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Our business is
capital intensive and has required, and will continue to require,
significant investments in property, plant and equipment. At December
31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment
was $1,702 million and $1,710 million, respectively. As discussed in
note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we and the Predecessor
assess the recoverability of property, plant and equipment to be held
and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of
assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset or group of assets. If such assets are
considered impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
value of the assets.

In December 2004, we approved a plan to
dispose of the COC business included within the Ticona segment. This
decision resulted in $32 million of asset impairment charges recorded
as a special charge related to the COC business.

As a result of
the planned consolidation of tow production and the termination of
filament production, the Acetate Products segment recorded impairment
charges of $50 million associated with plant and equipment in the nine
months ended December 31, 2004.

We assess the recoverability of
the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives at least annually or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be fully recoverable. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the
reporting unit level based on a two-step approach. First, the carrying
amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as estimated
by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
reporting unit. To the extent, that the carrying value of the reporting
unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a second step is
performed, wherein the reporting unit's assets and liabilities
are fair valued. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as
the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the fair value of all
non-goodwill assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit. To
the extent that the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill
exceeds its implied fair value, impairment exists and must be
recognized. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $1,147 million of
goodwill and other intangible assets, net.

During 2003, the
Predecessor performed the annual impairment test of goodwill and
determined that there was no impairment. As a result of the tender
offer price of €32.50 per share announced on


December 16, 2003, which would place an
implicit value on CAG at an amount below book value of the net assets,
the Predecessor initiated an impairment analysis in accordance with
SFAS No. 142. The impairment analysis was prepared on a reporting unit
level and utilized the most recent cash flow, discount rate and growth
rate assumptions. Based on the resulting analysis, the
Predecessor's management concluded that goodwill was not impaired
as of December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2004, no significant
changes in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances that
drive the impairment analysis led management to believe goodwill might
have been impaired. We will continue to evaluate the need for
impairment if changes in circumstances or available information
indicate that impairment may have occurred. In the future, we expect to
perform the required impairment tests at least annually on each June 30
unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing.

A prolonged
general economic downturn and, specifically, a continued downturn in
the chemical industry as well as other market factors could intensify
competitive pricing pressure, create an imbalance of industry supply
and demand, or otherwise diminish volumes or profits. Such events,
combined with changes in interest rates, could adversely affect our
estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long-lived
assets. Consequently, it is possible that our future operating results
could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment
charges related to the recoverability of our long-lived assets.

Restructuring and Special Charges

Special charges
include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income
incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations. Restructuring
provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit
programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally
redesign our operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a
decision to exit non-strategic businesses. These measures are based on
formal management decisions, establishment of agreements with the
employees' representatives or individual agreements with the
affected employees as well as the public announcement of the
restructuring plan. The related reserves reflect certain estimates,
including those pertaining to separation costs, settlements of
contractual obligations and other closure costs. We reassess the
reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our
restructuring program at the end of each reporting period. Actual
experience has been and may continue to be different from these
estimates. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Liabilities

We manufacture and sell a
diverse line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly,
the businesses' operations are subject to various hazards
incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use,
handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous
materials. We recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to
environmental matters if available information indicates that it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is
reasonably estimated. If the event of loss is neither probable nor
reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible, the Company provides
appropriate disclosure in the notes to its Consolidated Financial
Statements if the contingency is material.

Total reserves for
environmental liabilities were $143 million and $159 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Measurement of environmental
reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information
with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as
existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior
experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental
reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for
example, provision for one or more of the following types of costs:
site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to
soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and
post-remediation monitoring costs. These reserves do not take into
account any claims or recoveries from insurance. There are no pending
insurance claims for any environmental liability that are expected to
be material. The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on a
range of management's periodic estimate of what it will cost to
perform each of the elements of the remediation effort. We use our best
estimate within the range to establish our environmental reserves. We
utilize third parties to assist in the management and the development
of our cost estimates for our sites. Changes to environmental
regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are
reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in


which they occur. We accrue for legal fees
related to litigation matters when the costs associated with defense
can be reasonably estimated and are probable to occur. All other fees
are expensed as incurred. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Total
reserves for asset retirement obligations were $52 million and $47
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. SFAS No. 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The
liability is measured at the discounted fair value and is adjusted to
its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is
recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as
part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Management has
identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to
substantially all its existing operating facilities. Examples of these
types of obligations include demolition, decommissioning, disposal and
restoration activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the
retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or
abandonment of the existing operations. However, operations at these
facilities are expected to continue indefinitely and therefore a
reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time. In
the future, we will assess strategies of the businesses acquired and
may support decisions that differ from past decisions of management
regarding the continuing operations of existing facilities. Asset
retirement obligations will be recorded if these strategies are changed
and probabilities of closure are assigned to existing facilities. If
certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset
retirement obligations could significantly affect our results of
operations and cash flows.

In accordance with SFAS No. 143, the
Acetate Products segment recorded a charge of $8 million, included
within 2003 depreciation expense, related to potential asset retirement
obligations, as a result of a worldwide assessment of our acetate
production capacity. The assessment concluded that there was a
probability that certain facilities would be closed in the latter half
of the decade. In October 2004 we announced plans to consolidate flake
and tow production by early 2007 and to discontinue production of
filament by mid-2005. The restructuring will result in the
discontinuance of acetate production at two sites. As such, we recorded
a charge of $12 million included within depreciation expense, of which
$8 million was recorded by the Acetate Products segment and $4 million
by the Chemical Products segment, for the nine months ended December
31, 2004.

Realization of Deferred Tax Assets

Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) were ($151) million and
$555 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Management
regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and
establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income,
projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies, and the
expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A
valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Such evaluations require significant management judgments. Valuation
allowances have been established primarily for U.S. federal and state
net operating losses carryforwards, certain German income tax loss
carryforwards, Mexican net operating loss carryforwards and Canadian
deferred tax assets. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

On April 6, 2004, the closing date of the
acquisition of CAG, the Predecessor had approximately $576 million in
net deferred tax assets, of which $531 million were in the U.S.,
including $172 million arising from U.S. net operating loss
("NOL") carryforwards. Under U.S. tax law,
the utilization of deferred tax assets related to NOL carryforwards is
subject to an annual limitation if there is a more than 50 percentage
point change in shareholder ownership. The acquisition of CAG triggered
this limitation. As a result of this limitation and the Restructuring,
$153 million of the $172 million NOL was written off and a valuation
allowance was established against the remaining $19 million. In
addition, as a result of the Restructuring, including the transfer of
CAC to BCP Crystal, we determined that it was no longer more likely
than not that we would realize our other net U.S. deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our $351 million
of other net pre-acquisition U.S. deferred tax assets (reduced by
deferred tax liabilities) with a corresponding increase in goodwill. In
addition, the valuation allowance


on U.S. deferred assets was increased by $33
million through a charge to tax expense during the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 related to activity subsequent to the closing date of
the acquisition of CAG.

As a result of the conclusion of an
income tax examination for the tax audit period ending December 31,
2000 and the receipt of the final tax and interest assessment,
management reversed accrued income tax reserves attributable to that
period. This resulted in a decrease in income taxes payable and a
decrease in goodwill of $113 million as it was a purchase accounting
adjustment.

Benefit Obligations

Pension and
other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees
who meet eligibility requirements are sponsored by CAC. With respect to
its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum funding
requirements are determined by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act. For the periods presented, the Predecessor or the Company had not
been required to contribute under these minimum funding requirements.
However, the Predecessor chose to contribute to the U.S. defined
benefit pension plan $33 million, $130 million and $100 million for
three months ended March 31, 2004 and for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The Successor chose to contribute to the
U.S defined benefit pension plan $300 million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004. Contributions to the German pension plans for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004 were $105 million. Benefits are
generally based on years of service and/or compensation. Various
assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of
the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the weighted
average discount rate, rates of increase in compensation levels,
expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and increases or
trends in health care costs. In addition to the above mentioned
assumptions, actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as
withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit
obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from
actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher
or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of
participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to
the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods.

The
amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to
pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an
actuarial basis. A significant assumption used in determining our
pension expense is the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. At December 31, 2004, we assumed an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 8.5% for the U.S. qualified defined
benefit pension plan, which represents greater than 85 percent and 80
percent of pension plan assets and liabilities, respectively. On
average, the actual return on plan assets over the long-term (15 to 20
years) has exceeded 9.0%. However, for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan
assets actual return was less than the expected long-term rate of
return of plan assets. The Company had lowered the expected long-term
rate of return on U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan assets
from 9.0% to 8.5% as it expects lower future returns
considering the lower inflationary environment.

For the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, our expected long-term rate of return
assumption for our U.S. plans was 8.5%, reflecting the generally
expected moderation of long-term rates of return in the financial
markets. We estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected long-term
rate of return for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to
increase pension expense by an estimated $5 million in 2004. Another
estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit
expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of
pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations. At the end
of each year, we determine the appropriate discount rate, which
represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the
present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to
settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The
discount rate is generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate
fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2004, we lowered the discount
rate to 5.88% from 6.25% at December 31, 2003 for the
U.S. plans. We estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount
rate for the U.S. pension and postretirement medical plans will
increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by an
estimated $5 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and our
benefit obligations by approximately $130 million and approximately $13
million, respectively.


Over the past several years, CAG had
experienced significant increases (in excess of $400 million) in
unrecognized net actuarial pension losses. The losses were mainly due
to asset losses resulting from asset returns that were less than the
assumed rate of return and increases in the projected benefit
obligation.

Other postretirement benefit plans plans provide
medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age
and service requirements. The postretirement benefit cost for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, three months ended March 31, 2004 and
the year ended December 31, 2003, includes $21 million, $8 million, and
$35 million, respectively, and the accrued post-retirement liability
was $406 million and $320 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, in other noncurrent liabilities. The key determinants of
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
("APBO") are the discount rate and the
healthcare cost trend rate. The healthcare cost trend rate has a
significant effect on the reported amounts of APBO and related expense.
For example, increasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one
percentage point in each year would increase the APBO at December 31,
2004, and the 2004 postretirement benefit cost by approximately $2
million and less than $1 million, and decreasing the healthcare cost
trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the APBO
at September 30, 2004 and the 2004 postretirement benefit cost by
approximately $2 million and less than $1 million, respectively. See
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting for Commitments and Contingencies

The
Company is subject to a number of lawsuits, claims, and investigations,
incidental to the normal conduct of its business, relating to and
including product liability, patent and intellectual property,
commercial, contract, antitrust, and employment matters, which are
handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. See Note 27 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management routinely assesses
the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as
well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses. Reasonable
estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a
broad range of information including: notifications, demands,
settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or
private party, estimates performed by independent consultants and
outside counsel, available facts, identification of other potentially
responsible parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior
experience. A determination of the amount of loss contingency required,
if any, is assessed in accordance with SFAS No. 5
"

Contingencies and Commitments

" and
recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each
individual matter. The required reserves may change in the future due
to new developments in each matter and as additional information
becomes available. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

CNA Holdings, Inc. ("CNA
Holdings"), a U.S. subsidiary of ours and the Predecessor,
which includes the U.S. business now conducted by Ticona, along with
Shell Chemical Company ("Shell") and E. I. du
Pont de Nemours ("DuPont"), among others,
have been the defendants in a series of lawsuits, alleging that
plastics manufactured by these companies that were utilized in the
production of plumbing systems for residential property were defective
or caused such plumbing systems to fail. CNA Holdings has accrued its
best estimate of its share of the plumbing actions. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, accruals were $73 million and $76 million, respectively,
for this matter, of which $11 million and $14 million, respectively,
are included in current liabilities. Management believes that the
plumbing actions are adequately provided for in the consolidated
financial statements. However, if we were to incur an additional charge
for this matter, such a charge would not be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the financial position, but may have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given
accounting period. The Predecessor's receivables relating to the
anticipated recoveries from third party insurance carriers for this
product liability matter are based on the probability of collection on
the settlement agreements reached with a majority of the insurance
carriers whose coverage level exceeds the receivables and based on the
status of current discussions with other insurance carriers. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, insurance claims receivables were $75
million and $63 million, respectively. Collectibility could vary
depending on the financial status of the insurance carriers.

Nutrinova Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties
& Food Ingredients GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and the
Predecessor, is party to various legal proceedings in the United
States, Canada and Europe alleging Nutrinova Inc. engaged in unlawful,
anticompetitive behavior which affected the sorbates markets while it
was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hoechst. In accordance with the


demerger agreement between Hoechst and
Celanese AG, which became effective October 1999, CAG, the successor to
Hoechst's sorbates business, was assigned the obligation related
to these matters. However, Hoechst agreed to indemnify Celanese AG for
80 percent of payments for such obligations. Expenses related to this
matter are recorded gross of any such recoveries from Hoechst while the
recoveries from Hoechst, which represents 80 percent of such expenses,
are recorded directly to shareholders' equity, net of tax, as a
contribution of capital.

Based on a review of the
existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates matter,
including the status of governmental investigations, as well as civil
claims filed and settled, we and the Predecessor had remaining accruals
of $145 million and $137 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, for the estimated loss relative to this matter. Although
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty,
management's best estimate of the range of possible additional
future losses and fines, including any that may result from
governmental proceedings, as of December 31, 2004 is between $0 and $9
million. The estimated range of such possible future losses is
management's best estimate taking into consideration potential
fines and claims, both civil and criminal, that may be imposed or made
in other jurisdictions. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we and the
Predecessor had receivables, recorded within current assets, relating
to the sorbates indemnification from Hoechst of $116 million and $110
million, respectively.

Business combinations

Upon
closing an acquisition, the Company estimates the fair values of assets
and liabilities acquired and consolidates the acquisition as soon as
practicable. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to
finalize the acquired company's balance sheet (frequently with
implications for the purchase price of the acquisition), then to adjust
the acquired company's accounting policies, procedures, books and
records to our standards, it is often several quarters before the
Company is able to finalize those initial fair value estimates.
Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be
subsequently revised. The judgements made in determining the estimated
fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net earnings
(loss).

In valuing the acquisition of CAG, the Company utilized
various valuation methods with the assistance from valuation
specialists. The significant assets and liabilities valued include
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and cost and equity
method investments.

In connection with the acquisition of CAG,
at the acquisition date, the Company began formulating a plan to exit
or restructure certain activities. The Company has not completed this
analysis, but has recorded initial liabilities of $60  million,
primarily for employee severance and related costs in connection with
the preliminary plan, as well as approving the continuation of all
existing Predecessor restructuring and exit plans. As the Company
finalizes its plans to exit or restructure activities, it may record
additional liabilities for, among other things, severance and severance
related costs, which would also increase the goodwill recorded.

Captive Insurance Companies

The Company
consolidates two wholly owned insurance companies (the
"Captives"). The Captives are a key component
of the Company's global risk management program as well as a form
of self-insurance for property, liability and workers compensation
risks. The Captives issue insurance policies to the Company's
subsidiaries to provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in
the insurance market and to lower long-term insurance costs by avoiding
or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory fees. The
Captives issue insurance policies and coordinate claims handling
services with third party service providers. They retain risk at levels
approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third
parties to limit the net risk retained. One of the Captives also
insures certain third party risks.

The assets of the
Captives consist primarily of marketable securities and reinsurance
receivables. Marketable securities values are based on quoted market
prices or dealer quotes. The carrying value of the amounts recoverable
under the reinsurance agreements approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these items.


The liabilities recorded by the
Captives relate to the estimated risk of loss recorded by the Captives,
which is based on management estimates and actuarial valuations, and
unearned premiums, which represent the portion of the premiums written
applicable to the terms of the policies in force. The establishment of
the provision for outstanding losses is based upon known facts and
interpretation of circumstances influenced by a variety of factors. In
establishing a provision, management considers facts currently known
and the current state of laws and litigation where applicable.
Liabilities are recognized for known claims when sufficient information
has been developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and
management can reasonably estimate their liability. In addition,
liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure on both
known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the liabilities are reviewed
and updated regularly. It is possible that actual results could differ
significantly from the recorded liabilities.

The
Captives use reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risk of loss.
Reinsurance arrangements however do not relieve the Captives from their
obligations to policyholders. Failure of the reinsurers to honor their
obligations could result in losses to the Captives. The Captives
evaluate the financial condition of their reinsurers and monitor
concentrations of credit risk to minimize their exposure to significant
losses from reinsurer insolvencies and establish allowances for amounts
deemed non-collectable.

Premiums written are recognized
based on the terms of the policies. Capitalization of the Captives is
determined by regulatory guidelines. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
the net retained concurrent aggregate risk of all policies written by
the Captives, after reinsuring higher tier risks with third party
insurance companies, net of established reserves, amounted to
approximately $498 million and $484 million, respectively.

Forward-Looking Statements May Prove Inaccurate

This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking
statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs
of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information
currently available to, us. These statements include, but are not
limited to, statements about our strategies, plans, objectives,
expectations, intentions, expenditures, and assumptions and other
statements contained in this prospectus that are not historical facts.
When used in this document, words such as
"anticipate,"
"believe,"
"estimate,"
"expect," "intend,"
"plan" and
"project" and similar expressions, as they
relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are
not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Further, certain
forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future
events that may not prove to be accurate.

Many factors
could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. These factors include, among other things:

•

changes in general economic,
business, political and regulatory conditions in the countries or
regions in which we
operate;

•

the length and depth
of product and industry business cycles particularly in the automotive,
electrical, electronics and construction
industries;

•

changes in the
price and availability of raw materials, particularly changes in the
demand for, supply of, and market prices of fuel oil, natural gas,
coal, electricity and petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene and
butane, including changes in production quotas in OPEC countries and
the deregulation of the natural gas transmission industry in
Europe;

•

the ability to pass
increases in raw material prices on to customers or otherwise improve
margins through price
increases;

•

the ability to
maintain plant utilization rates and to implement planned capacity
additions and expansions;

•

the
ability to reduce production costs and improve productivity by
implementing technological improvements to existing
plants;

•

the existence of
temporary industry surplus production capacity resulting from the
integration and start-up of new world-scale plants;


•

increased
price competition and the introduction of competing products by other
companies;

•

the ability to
develop, introduce and market innovative products, product grades and
applications, particularly in the Ticona and Performance Products
segments of our
business;

•

changes in the degree
of patent and other legal protection afforded to our
products;

•

compliance costs and
potential disruption or interruption of production due to accidents or
other unforeseen events or delays in construction of
facilities;

•

potential liability
for remedial actions under existing or future environmental
regulations;

•

potential
liability resulting from pending or future litigation, or from changes
in the laws, regulations or policies of governments or other
governmental activities in the countries in which we
operate;

•

changes in currency
exchange rates and interest
rates;

•

changes in the
composition or restructuring of us or our subsidiaries and the
successful completion of acquisitions, divestitures and venture
activities;

•

pending or future
challenges to the Domination Agreement;
and

•

various other factors, both
referenced and not referenced in this prospectus.

Many
of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond
our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our
actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from
those described in this Annual Report as anticipated, believed,
estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. We neither intend
nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of their dates.


RISK FACTORS

Many factors could have an effect on Celanese's financial
condition, cash flows and results of operations. We are subject to
various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental,
political, industry, business and financial conditions. The principal
factors are described below.

Risks Related to the Acquisition
of Celanese AG

If the Domination
Agreement ceases to be operative, the Company's managerial
control over Celanese AG is limited.

We own 100% of the
outstanding shares of CAC and approximately 84% of the
outstanding shares of CAG. Our access to cash flows of, and our control
of, CAG is subject to the continuing effectiveness of the Domination
Agreement. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity—Domination
Agreement."

The Domination Agreement is subject to
legal challenges instituted by dissenting shareholders. Minority
shareholders have filed nine actions against CAG in the Frankfurt
District Court (

Landgericht

), seeking, among other things, to
set aside the shareholder resolutions passed at the extraordinary
general meeting held on July 30 and 31, 2004 based, among other things,
on the alleged violation of procedural requirements and information
rights of the shareholders, to declare the Domination Agreement and the
change in the fiscal year void and to prohibit CAG from performing its
obligations under the Domination Agreement. Pursuant to German law, the
time period for the filing of such challenges has expired. Further,
several additional minority shareholders have joined the proceedings
via third party intervention in support of the plaintiffs. The
Purchaser has joined the proceedings via third party intervention in
support of CAG. In addition, a German court could revoke the
registration of the Domination Agreement in the commercial register. On
August 2, 2004, two minority shareholders instituted public register
proceedings with the Königstein Local Court (

Amtsgericht

)
and the Frankfurt District Court, both with a view to have the
registration of the Domination Agreement in the Commercial Register
deleted (

Amtslöschungsverfahren

). See "Legal
Proceedings."

If the Domination Agreement ceases to
be operative, the Purchaser's ability, and thus our ability to
control the board of management decisions of CAG, will be significantly
limited by German law. As a result, we may not be able to ensure that
our strategy for the operation of our business can be fully
implemented. In addition, our access to the operating cash flow of CAG
in order to fund payment requirements on our indebtedness will be
limited, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our
stock.

If the Domination Agreement ceases
to be operative, certain actions taken under the Domination Agreement
might have to be reversed.

If legal challenges of the
Domination Agreement by dissenting shareholders of CAG are successful,
some or all actions taken under the Domination Agreement, including the
Restructuring, may be required to be reversed and the Purchaser may be
required to compensate CAG for damages caused by such actions. Any such
event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make
payments on our indebtedness and on the value of our stock.

Minority shareholders may interfere with
CAG's future actions, which may prevent us from causing CAG to
take actions which may have beneficial effects for our
shareholders.

The Purchaser currently owns approximately
84% of the CAG Shares. Shareholders unrelated to us hold the
remainder of the outstanding CAG Shares. German law provides certain
rights to minority shareholders, which could have the effect of
delaying, or interfering with, corporate actions (including those
requiring shareholder approval), such as the potential application for
revocation of admission of the CAG Shares to the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the squeeze-out and the potential conversion of CAG from its
current legal form of a stock corporation into a limited partnership
(

Kommanditgesellschaft, KG

) or a limited liability company
(

Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH

) in accordance
with the


provisions of the German Transformation Act
(

Umwandlungsgesetz, UmwG

). Minority shareholders may be able to
delay or prevent the implementation of CAG's corporate actions
irrespective of the size of their shareholding. Any challenge by
minority shareholders to the validity of a corporate action may be
subject to judicial resolution that may substantially delay or hinder
the implementation of such action. Such delays of, or interferences
with, corporate actions as well as related litigation may limit our
access to CAG's cash flows and make it difficult or impossible
for us to take or implement corporate actions which may be desirable in
view of our operating or financial requirements, including actions
which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders.

CAG's board of management may refuse to
comply with instructions given by the Purchaser pursuant to the
Domination Agreement, which may prevent us from causing CAG to take
actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders.

Under the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser is entitled to give
instructions directly to the board of management of CAG, including, but
not limited to, instructions that are disadvantageous to CAG, as long
as such disadvantageous instructions benefit the Purchaser or the
companies affiliated with either the Purchaser or CAG. CAG's
board of management is required to comply with any such instruction,
unless, at the time when such instruction is given, (i) it is, in the
opinion of the board of management of CAG, obviously not in the
interests of the Purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the
Purchaser or CAG, (ii) in the event of a disadvantageous instruction,
the negative consequences to CAG are disproportionate to the benefits
to the Purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the Purchaser
or CAG, (iii) compliance with the instruction would violate legal or
statutory restrictions, (iv) compliance with the instruction would
endanger the existence of CAG or (v) it is doubtful whether the
Purchaser will be able to fully compensate CAG, as required by the
Domination Agreement, for its annual loss (

Jahresfehlbetrag

)
incurred during the fiscal year in which such instruction is given. The
board of management of CAG remains ultimately responsible for making
the executive decisions for CAG and the Purchaser, despite the
Domination Agreement, is not entitled to act on behalf of, and has no
power to legally bind, CAG. The CAG board of management may delay the
implementation of, or refuse to implement, any of the Purchaser's
instructions despite its general obligation to follow such instructions
(with the exceptions mentioned above). Such delays of, or interferences
with, compliance with the Purchaser's instructions by the board
of management of CAG may make it difficult or impossible for the
Purchaser to implement corporate actions which may be desirable in view
of our operating or financial requirements, including actions which may
have beneficial effects for our shareholders.

The Purchaser will be required to ensure that
CAG pays a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the minority shareholders
of CAG, which may reduce the funds the Purchaser can otherwise make
available to us.

As long as the Purchaser does not own
100% of the outstanding CAG Shares, the Domination Agreement
requires, among other things, the Purchaser to ensure that CAG makes a
gross guaranteed fixed annual payment (

Ausgleich

) to minority
shareholders of €3.27 per CAG share less certain corporate
taxes in lieu of any future dividend. Taking into account the
circumstances and the tax rates at the time of the entering into of the
Domination Agreement, the net guaranteed fixed annual payment is
€2.89 per share for a full fiscal year. As of December 31,
2004, there were approximately 8  million CAG Shares held by
minority shareholders. The net guaranteed fixed annual payment may,
depending on applicable corporate tax rates, in the future be higher,
lower or the same as €2.89. The amount of this guaranteed
fixed annual payment was calculated in accordance with applicable
German law. Such guaranteed fixed annual payments will be required
regardless of whether the actual distributable profits per share of CAG
are higher, equal to, or lower than the amount of the guaranteed fixed
annual payment per share. The guaranteed fixed annual payment will be
payable for so long as there are minority shareholders of CAG and the
Domination Agreement remains in place. No dividends for the period
after effectiveness of the Domination Agreement, other than the
guaranteed fixed annual payment effectively paid by the Purchaser, are
expected to be paid by CAG. These requirements may reduce the funds the
Purchaser can make available to Celanese and its subsidiaries and,
accordingly, diminish our ability to make payments, on our respective
indebtedness. See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity—Domination
Agreement."


The amounts of the
fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment
offered under the Domination Agreement may be increased, which may
further reduce the funds the Purchaser can otherwise make available to
us.

Several minority shareholders of CAG have initiated special
award proceedings (

Spruchverfahren

) seeking the court's
review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation (

Abfindung

)
and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment (

Ausgleich

) offered
under the Domination Agreement. As a result of these proceedings, the
amounts of the fair cash compensation (

Abfindung

) and of the
guaranteed fixed annual payment (

Ausgleich

) could be increased
by the court, and the Purchaser would be required to make such payments
within the two months after the publication of the court's
ruling. Any such increase may be substantial. All minority shareholders
including those who have already received the fair cash compensation
would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts. This may
reduce the funds the Purchaser can make available to Celanese and its
subsidiaries and, accordingly, diminish our ability to make payments on
our indebtedness. See "Legal
Proceedings."

The Purchaser
may be required to compensate CAG for annual losses, which may reduce
the funds the Purchaser can otherwise make available to Celanese.

Under the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser is required, among
other things, to compensate CAG for any annual loss incurred,
determined in accordance with German accounting requirements, by CAG at
the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred. This
obligation to compensate CAG for annual losses will apply during the
entire term of the Domination Agreement. If CAG incurs losses during
any period of the operative term of the Domination Agreement and if
such losses lead to an annual loss of CAG at the end of any given
fiscal year during the term of the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser
will be obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to CAG to the
extent that the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by
the dissolution of profit reserves (

Gewinnrücklagen

)
accrued at the level of CAG during the term of the Domination
Agreement. The Purchaser may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments
to CAG by off-setting against such loss compensation claims by CAG any
valuable counterclaims against CAG that the Purchaser may have. If the
Purchaser was obligated to make cash payments to CAG to cover an annual
loss, we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our
indebtedness when due and, unless the Purchaser is able to obtain funds
from a source other than annual profits of CAG, the Purchaser may not
be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity—Domination
Agreement."

Two of our
subsidiaries have agreed to guarantee the Purchaser's obligation
under the Domination Agreement, which may diminish our ability to make
payments on our indebtedness.

Our subsidiaries, BCP Caylux and
BCP Crystal, have each agreed to provide the Purchaser with financing
to strengthen the Purchaser's ability to fulfill its obligations
under, or in connection with, the Domination Agreement and to ensure
that the Purchaser will perform all of its obligations under, or in
connection with, the Domination Agreement when such obligations become
due, including, without limitation, the obligations to make a
guaranteed fixed annual payment to the outstanding minority
shareholders, to offer to acquire all outstanding CAG Shares from the
minority shareholders in return for payment of fair cash consideration
and to compensate CAG for any annual loss incurred by CAG during the
term of the Domination Agreement. If BCP Caylux and/or BCP Crystal are
obligated to make payments under such guarantees or other security to
the Purchaser and/or the minority shareholders, we may not have
sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due.

Even if the minority shareholders'
challenges to the Domination Agreement are unsuccessful and the
Domination Agreement continues to be operative, we may not be able to
receive distributions from CAG sufficient to pay our obligations.

Even if the minority shareholders' challenges to the
Domination Agreement are unsuccessful and the Domination Agreement
continues to be operative, we are limited in the amount of
distributions we may receive in any year from CAG. Under German law,
the amount of distributions to the Purchaser will be


determined based on the amount of
unappropriated earnings generated during the term of the Domination
Agreement as shown in the unconsolidated annual financial statements of
CAG, prepared in accordance with German accounting principles and as
adopted and approved by resolutions of the CAG board of management and
supervisory board, which financial statements may be different from
Celanese's consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Our
share of these earnings, if any, may not be in amounts and at times
sufficient to allow us to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due, which
could have a material adverse effect on the value of the stock.

We must rely on payments from our
subsidiaries to fund payments on our preferred stock and certain of our
subsidiaries must rely on payments from their own subsidiaries to fund
payments on their indebtedness. Such funds may not be available in
certain circumstances.

We must rely on payments from our
subsidiaries to fund dividend, redemption and other payments on our
preferred stock. In addition, our subsidiaries, BCP Crystal and Crystal
US Holdings 3 L.L.C. ("Crystal LLC"), are
holding companies and all of their operations are conducted through
their subsidiaries. Therefore, they depend on the cash flow of their
subsidiaries, including CAG, to meet their obligations, including
obligations of approximately $3.7 billion of our indebtedness (after
giving effect to the Concurrent Financings and excluding $242 million
to be drawn down from our amended and restated credit facilities to
fund the Acetex acquisition). If the Domination Agreement ceases to be
operative, such subsidiaries may be unable to meet their obligations
under such indebtedness. Although the Domination Agreement became
operative on October 1, 2004, it is subject to legal challenges
instituted by dissenting shareholders. In August 2004, minority
shareholders filed nine actions against CAG in the Frankfurt District
Court (

Landgericht

) seeking, among other things, to set aside
the shareholder resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting
held on July 30 and 31, 2004 based, among other things, on the alleged
violation of procedural requirements and information rights of the
shareholders, to declare the Domination Agreement and the change in the
fiscal year void and to prohibit CAG from performing its obligations
under the Domination Agreement. Pursuant to German law, the time period
for the filing of such challenges has expired. Further, several
additional minority shareholders have joined the proceedings via third
party intervention in support of the plaintiffs. The Purchaser has
joined the proceedings via third party intervention to support CAG. In
addition, a German court could revoke the registration of the
Domination Agreement in the commercial register. On August 2, 2004, two
minority shareholders instituted public register proceedings with the
Königstein Local Court (

Amtsgericht

) and the Frankfurt
District Court, both with a view to have the registration of the
Domination Agreement in the Commercial Register deleted
(

Amtslöschungsverfahren

). See "Legal
Proceedings." The ability of our subsidiaries to make
distributions to us, BCP Crystal and Crystal LLC by way of dividends,
interest, return on investments, or other payments (including loans) or
distributions is subject to various restrictions, including
restrictions imposed by the senior credit facilities and indentures
governing their indebtedness, and the terms of future debt may also
limit or prohibit such payments. In addition, the ability of the
subsidiaries to make such payments may be limited by relevant
provisions of German and other applicable laws.

Our internal controls over financial
reporting may not be effective and our independent auditors may not be
able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a
significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.

We are evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting in
order to allow management to report on, and our independent auditors to
attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting, as required
by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, which we refer to as Section 404. We
are currently performing the system and process evaluation and testing
required (and any necessary remediation) in an effort to comply with
management certification and auditor attestation requirements of
Section 404. The management certification and auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 will initially apply to Celanese as of
December 31, 2006 and to CAG as of September 30, 2006. In the course of
our ongoing Section 404 evaluation, we have identified areas of
internal controls that may need improvement, and plan to design
enhanced processes and controls to address these and any other issues
that might be identified through this review. Currently,


none of the identified areas that need
improvement have been categorized as significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses, individually or in the aggregate. However, as we
are still in the evaluation process, we may identify conditions that
may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
future. In 2004, certain members of our accounting staff identified two
significant deficiencies and our auditors identified two material
weaknesses, in addition to, and separate from, our Section 404
evaluation process. As a result of the material weaknesses that were
identified, Celanese concluded that as of December 31, 2004, its
"disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) were not effective for recording, processing, summarizing and
reporting the material information Celanese is required to disclose in
the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission.
These deficiencies and material weaknesses are discussed in detail in
the immediately subsequent risk factor and Item
9A—"Controls and Procedures".

We
cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation,
testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our
operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section
404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent
auditors may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting and we may be subject to
sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial
markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial
statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving
our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any
such action could negatively affect our results.

We expect to
incur expenses of an aggregate of approximately $9 million to $14
million in 2005 in connection with our compliance with Section 404.

We have in the past identified significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal controls, and the
identification of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in the future could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable
financial reports.

In addition to, and separate from, our
evaluation of internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and any areas requiring improvement that we identify as
part of that process, we previously identified two significant
deficiencies and two material weaknesses in our internal controls. The
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
("PCAOB") defines a significant deficiency as
a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that
adversely affects the company's ability to initiate, authorize,
record, process, or report external financial data reliably in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that
there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the
company's annual or interim financial statements that is more
than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. The PCAOB
defines a material weakness as a single deficiency, or combination of
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a
material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected.

We are in the process of
implementing changes to strengthen our internal controls. In addition,
while we have taken actions to address these deficiencies and
weaknesses, additional measures may be necessary and these measures
along with other measures we expect to take to improve our internal
controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified by us
or ensure that our internal controls are effective. For a description
of these deficiencies and weaknesses, see Item 9A —
"Controls and Procedures." If we are unable
to correct deficiencies or weaknesses in internal controls in a timely
manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of
the SEC will be adversely affected. This failure could materially and
adversely impact our business, our financial condition and the market
value of our securities.


Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our high level of indebtedness could diminish
our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit
our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals
industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our
indebtedness.

We are highly leveraged. Our total indebtedness
totals approximately $3.7 billion (after giving effect to the
Concurrent Financings and excluding $242 million to be drawn down from
our credit facilities to fund the Acetex acquisition). Our substantial
debt could have important consequences for you, including:

•

making it more difficult
for us to make payments on our debt;

•

increasing vulnerability
to general economic and industry conditions;

•

requiring a substantial
portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of
principal and interest on indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability
to use cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future
business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk
of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including the
floating rate term loan and borrowings under the senior credit
facilities, are at variable rates of
interest;

•

limiting
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital
expenditures, product development, debt service requirements,
acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to
adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.

Despite our current high leverage, we and our
subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could
further exacerbate the risks of our high leverage.

We may be
able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The
terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so. The
revolving credit facilities provide commitments of up to $2.8 billion.
As of December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under the
revolving credit facilities and availability of $401 million (taking
into account letters of credit issued under the revolving credit
facilities). We also expect to incur an additional $242 million of
indebtedness under our amended and restated senior credit facilities to
finance the acquisition of Acetex. If new debt is added to our current
debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.

We may not be able to generate sufficient
cash to service our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other
actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be
successful.

Our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on
cash on hand, receipt of additional capital, including possible
additional borrowings, and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way
of distributions, advances or cash payments. Our total indebtedness
totals approximately $3.7 billion (after giving effect to the
Concurrent Financings and excluding $242 million to be drawn down from
our credit facilities to fund the Acetex acquisition). Debt service
requirements, excluding the $242 million to be drawn down from our
credit facilities to fund the Acetex acquisition, consist of principal
repayments aggregating $285 million in the next five years and $3,386
million thereafter (including $211 million of accreted value on the
senior discount notes) and average annual cash interest payments of
approximately $197 million in each of the next five years. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity—Contractual
Obligations."

Our ability to make scheduled
payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the
financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries,
which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and
to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We
may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if
any, and interest on our indebtedness.


If our cash flows and capital resources
are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced
to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets (including the CAG
Shares), seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our
indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may
not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the
absence of such operating results and resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of
material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other
obligations. The senior credit facilities and the indentures governing
our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the
proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those
dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them
and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service
obligations then due.

Restrictive
covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to engage in
certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on
our indebtedness.

The senior credit facilities and the
indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that
limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These
covenants limit the ability of Crystal LLC, BCP Crystal and their
restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness or issue preferred stock, pay dividends on or make other
distributions on or repurchase their capital stock or make other
restricted payments, make investments, and sell certain assets.

In addition, the senior credit facilities contain covenants that
require Celanese Holdings LLC ("Celanese
Holdings") to maintain specified financial ratios and
satisfy other financial condition tests. Celanese Holdings'
ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by
events beyond its control, and it may not be able to meet those tests
at all. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default
under the senior credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default under the senior credit facilities, the lenders could elect to
declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facilities to
be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend
further credit. If Celanese Holdings were unable to repay those
amounts, the lenders under the senior credit facilities could proceed
against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.
Celanese Holdings has pledged a significant portion of its assets as
collateral under the senior credit facilities. If the lenders under the
senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings,
Celanese Holdings may not have sufficient assets to repay the senior
credit facilities and its other indebtedness, which could have a
material adverse effect on the value of our stock.

The terms of the senior credit facilities
prohibit BCP Crystal and its subsidiaries from paying dividends or
otherwise transferring their assets to us.

Our operations are
conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends is
dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our
subsidiaries. However, the terms of the senior credit facilities
prohibit BCP Crystal and its subsidiaries from paying dividends or
otherwise transferring their assets to us. Accordingly, under the terms
of the senior credit facilities, BCP Crystal and its subsidiaries may
not make dividends to us to enable us to pay dividends on our
stock.

Risks Related to Our Business

We are an international company and are
exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and
risks in the countries in which we have significant operations.

We operate in the global market and have customers in many
countries. During the period covered by this Annual Report, we had
major facilities located in North America, Europe and Asia, including
facilities in Germany, China, Japan, Korea and Saudi Arabia operated
through ventures. Our principal customers are similarly global in
scope, and the prices of our most significant products are typically
world market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results
are affected directly and indirectly by world economic, political and
regulatory conditions.

Conditions such as the uncertainties
associated with war, terrorist activities, epidemics, pandemics or
political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could
affect us by causing delays or losses


in the supply or delivery of raw materials
and products as well as increased security costs, insurance premiums
and other expenses. These conditions could also result in or lengthen
economic recession in the United States, Europe, Asia or elsewhere.
Moreover, changes in laws or regulations, such as unexpected changes in
regulatory requirements (including import or export licensing
requirements), or changes in the reporting requirements of United
States, German or European Union governmental agencies, could increase
the cost of doing business in these regions. Any of these conditions
may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and
may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities,
including the stock.

Cyclicality in the
industrial chemicals industry has in the past and may in the future
result in reduced operating margins or in operating losses.

Consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture, in
particular those in acetyl products, such as methanol, formaldehyde,
acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer, has increased significantly over
the past 30 years. Despite this growth in consumption, producers have
experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and excess
capacity for these products. Periods of inadequate capacity, including
some due to raw material shortages, have usually resulted in increased
selling prices and operating margins. This has often been followed by
periods of capacity additions, which have resulted in declining
capacity utilization rates, selling prices and operating margins. We
expect that these cyclical trends in selling prices and operating
margins relating to capacity shortfalls and additions will likely
persist in the future, principally due to the continuing combined
impact of five factors:

•

Significant capacity
additions, whether through plant expansion or construction, can take
two to three years to come on stream and are therefore necessarily
based upon estimates of future demand.

•

When demand is rising,
competition to build new capacity may be heightened because new
capacity tends to be more profitable, with a lower marginal cost of
production. This tends to amplify upswings in capacity.

•

When demand is falling,
the high fixed cost structure of the capital-intensive chemicals
industry leads producers to compete aggressively on price in order to
maximize capacity utilization.

•

As competition in these
products is focused on price, being a low-cost producer is critical to
profitability. This favors the construction of larger plants, which
maximize economies of scale, but which also lead to major increases in
capacity that can outstrip current growth in demand.

•

Cyclical trends in
general business and economic activity produce swings in demand for
chemicals.

We believe that the basic chemicals industry,
particularly in the commodity chemicals manufactured by our Chemical
Products segment, is currently characterized by overcapacity, and that
there may be further capacity additions in the next few years.

The length and depth of product and industry
business cycles of our markets, particularly in the automotive,
electrical, construction and textile industries, may result in reduced
operating margins or in operating losses.

Some of the markets
in which our customers participate, such as the automotive, electrical,
construction and textile industries, are cyclical in nature, thus
posing a risk to us which is beyond our control. These markets are
highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use markets, and
may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and
pricing of our products.

We are subject
to risks associated with the increased volatility in raw materials
prices and the availability of key raw materials.

We purchase
significant amounts of natural gas, ethylene, butane, and propylene
from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the
Chemical Products segment, principally methanol, formaldehyde, acetic
acid, vinyl acetate monomer, as well as oxo products. We use a portion
of our output


of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in
the production of further products in all our segments. We also
purchase significant amounts of cellulose or wood pulp for use in our
production of cellulose acetate in the Acetate Products segment. We
purchase significant amounts of natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel
oil to supply the energy required in our production processes.

Prices of natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbons have increased
dramatically in 2004. To the extent this trend continues and we are
unable to pass through these price increases to our customers, our
operating profit and results of operations may be less favorable than
expected.

We are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our
raw materials and energy. Although we have agreements providing for the
supply of natural gas, ethylene, propylene, wood pulp, electricity,
coal and fuel oil, the contractual prices for these raw materials and
energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. Factors
which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and
which may do so in the future include:

•

Shortages of raw
materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from growing uses or new
uses;

•

Capacity
constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, strike action or
involuntary shutdowns;

•

The general level of
business and economic activity;
and

•

The direct or
indirect effect of governmental regulation.

We strive to improve
profit margins of many of our products through price increases when
warranted and accepted by the market; however, our operating margins
may decrease if we cannot pass on increased raw material prices to
customers. Even in periods during which raw material prices decline, we
may suffer decreasing operating profit margins if raw material price
reductions occur at a slower rate than decreases in the selling prices
of our products.

A substantial portion of our products and raw
materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market
supply/demand fundamentals change. We manage our exposure through the
use of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for
commodity price hedging, entering into long-term supply agreements, and
multi-year purchasing and sales agreements. Management's policy
for the majority of its natural gas and butane requirements allows
entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cash-settled
swap contracts. As of December 31, 2004, there were no derivative
contracts outstanding. In 2003, there were forward contracts covering
approximately 35% of the Company's Chemical Products
segment North American requirements. Management regularly assesses its
practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity requirements forward
and the utilization of a variety of other raw material hedging
instruments, in addition to forward purchase contracts, in accordance
with changes in market conditions. Management capped its exposure on
approximately 20% of its U.S. natural gas requirements during
the months of August and September of 2004. The fixed price natural gas
forward contracts and any premium associated with the purchase of a
price cap are principally settled through actual delivery of the
physical commodity. The maturities of the cash-settled swap or cap
contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have
the effect of securing or limiting predetermined prices for the
underlying commodity. Although these contracts were structured to limit
exposure to increases in commodity prices, certain swaps may also limit
the potential benefit the Company might have otherwise received from
decreases in commodity prices. These cash-settled swap or cap contracts
were accounted for as cash flow hedges.

We have a policy of
maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw
materials. However, some of our individual plants may have single
sources of supply for some of their raw materials, such as carbon
monoxide and acetaldehyde. We may not be able to obtain sufficient raw
materials due to unforeseen developments that would cause an
interruption in supply. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for
a raw material, these sources may not make up for the loss of a major
supplier. Nor can there be any guarantee that profitability will not be
affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply
in the event of the loss of a sole or a major supplier.

Failure to develop new products and
production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction
initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position.

Our
operating results, especially in our Performance Products and Technical
Polymers Ticona segments, depend significantly on the development of
commercially viable new products, product grades


and applications, as well as production
technologies. If we are unsuccessful in developing new products,
applications and production processes in the future, our competitive
position and operating results will be negatively affected. Likewise,
we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all
segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost
savings. These initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the
estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized.

Frankfurt airport expansion could require us
to reduce production capacity of, limit expansion potential of, or
incur relocation costs for our Kelsterbach plant which would lead to
significant additional costs.

The Frankfurt airport's
expansion plans include the construction of an additional runway. One
of the three sites under consideration, the northwest option, would be
located in close proximity to our Kelsterbach production plant. The
construction of this particular runway could have a negative effect on
the plant's current production capacity and future development.
While the government of the state of Hesse and the owner of the
Frankfurt airport promote the expansion of the northwest option, it is
uncertain whether this option is in accordance with applicable laws.
Although the government of the state of Hesse expects the plan approval
for the airport expansion in 2007 and the start of operations in
2009-2010, neither the final outcome of this matter nor its timing can
be predicted at this time.

Environmental
regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters
could subject us to liability for fines, clean-ups and other damages,
require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and
increase our manufacturing and delivery costs.

Costs related to
our compliance with environmental laws concerning, and potential
obligations with respect to, contaminated sites may have a significant
negative impact on our operating results. These include obligations
related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us, or
where waste from our operations was disposed. We also have obligations
related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and
transfer agreement between CAG and Hoechst, also referred to as the
demerger agreement, for environmental matters arising out of certain
divestitures that took place prior to the demerger. Our accruals for
environmental remediation obligations, $143 million as of December 31,
2004, may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying those accruals
prove incorrect or if we are held responsible for currently
undiscovered contamination. See "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates—Environmental Liabilities," and Notes 19
and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our operations
are subject to extensive international, national, state, local, and
other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and
health and safety matters. We incur substantial capital and other costs
to comply with these requirements. If we violate them, we can be held
liable for substantial fines and other sanctions, including limitations
on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of
environmental permits involved. Stricter environmental, safety and
health laws, regulations and enforcement policies could result in
substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our
operations and could subject our handling, manufacture, use, reuse or
disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at
present. Consequently, compliance with these laws could result in
significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities
and our business and operating results may be less favorable than
expected. Due to new air regulations in the United States, management
expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs
that will total approximately $30  million to $45 million through
2007. For example, the Miscellaneous Organic National Emissions
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) regulations, and
various approaches to regulating boilers and incinerators, including
the NESHAPs for Industrial/Commercial/Institutional Boilers and Process
Heaters, will impose additional requirements on our operations.
Although some of these rules have been finalized, a significant portion
of the NESHAPs for Industrial/Commercial/Institutional Boilers and
Process Heaters regulation that provides for a low risk alternative
method of compliance for hydrogen chloride emissions has been
challenged in federal court. We cannot predict the outcome of this
challenge, which could, if successful, increase our costs by, according
to our estimates, approximately $50  million above the $30
million to $45 million noted above through 2007 to comply with this
regulation. As another example, recent European Union regulations
require a trading system for carbon dioxide emissions to have been in
place by January 1, 2005. Accordingly, an emission trading system came
into


effect at the start of 2005. This
regulation will affect our power plants at the Kelsterbach and
Oberhausen sites, as well as power plants operated by other InfraServ
entities. We and the InfraServ entities may be required to develop
additional cost-effective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
further, which could result in increased capital expenditures.

We are also involved in several claims, lawsuits and administrative
proceedings relating to environmental matters. An adverse outcome in
any of them may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a
particular reporting period.

Changes in
environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements could lead to
a decrease in demand for our products.

New or revised
governmental regulations relating to health, safety and the environment
may also affect demand for our products. Pursuant to the European Union
regulation on Risk Assessment of Existing Chemicals, the European
Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission has been conducting risk
assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals. Some of the chemicals
initially being evaluated include vinyl acetate monomer or VAM, which
we produce. These risk assessments entail a multi-stage process to
determine to what extent the European Commission should classify the
chemical as a carcinogen and, if so, whether this classification and
related labeling requirements should apply only to finished products
that contain specified threshold concentrations of a particular
chemical. In the case of VAM, we currently do not expect a final ruling
until mid-2005. We and other VAM producers are participating in this
process with detailed scientific analyses supporting the
industry's position that VAM is not a probable human carcinogen
and that labeling of final products should not be required. If labeling
is required, then it should depend on relatively high parts per million
of residual VAM in these end products. We cannot predict the outcome or
effect of any final ruling.

Several recent studies have
investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various
end points including leukemia. The International Agency for Research on
Cancer or IARC recently reclassified formaldehyde from Group 2A
(probable human carcinogen) to Group 1 (known human carcinogen) based
on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a
rare cancer in humans. IARC also concluded that there is insufficient
evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational
exposure to formaldehyde, although it also characterized evidence for
such an association as strong. The results of IARC's review will
be examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting
worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements.
We are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from
formaldehyde. We are participating together with other producers and
users in the evaluations of these findings. We cannot predict the final
effect of IARC's reclassification.

Other recent
initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk
assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or
produced by us. These initiatives include the Voluntary
Children's Chemical Evaluation Program and High Production Volume
Chemical Initiative in the United States, as well as various European
Commission programs, such as the new European Environment and Health
Strategy, commonly known as SCALE, as well as the Proposal for the
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals or
REACH. REACH, which the European Commission proposed in October 2003,
will establish a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured
in, or imported to, the European Union. Depending on the final ruling,
additional testing, documentation and risk assessments will occur for
the chemical industry. This will affect European producers of chemicals
as well as all chemical companies worldwide that export to member
states of the European Union. The final ruling has not yet been
decided.

The above-mentioned assessments in the United States
and Europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals
involved and in additional requirements being placed on the production,
handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and
additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our
customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of
these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these
products.


Our production
facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous
materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative
effect on our operating results.

Our operations are subject to
operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing, including the
related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and
wastes. These hazards include, among other things:

•

pipeline and storage
tank leaks and ruptures;

•

explosions and fires;
and

•

discharges or
releases of toxic or hazardous substances.

These operating risks
can cause personal injury, property damage and environmental
contamination, and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities
and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The occurrence of
any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect
on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing
facility and our operating results and cash flows.

We maintain
property, business interruption and casualty insurance which we believe
is in accordance with customary industry practices, but we cannot
predict whether this insurance will be adequate to fully cover all
potential hazards incidental to our business.

Our significant non-U.S. operations expose us
to global exchange rate fluctuations that could impact our
profitability.

We are exposed to market risk through commercial
and financial operations. Our market risk consists principally of
exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates.

As we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the
United States, fluctuations in currencies of other countries,
especially the euro, may materially affect our operating results. For
example, changes in currency exchange rates may affect:

•

The relative prices at
which we and our competitors sell products in the same market; and

•

The cost of items
required in our operations.

We use financial instruments to
hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The net notional
amounts under such foreign currency contracts outstanding at December
31, 2004 were $288 million. The hedging activity of foreign currency
denominated intercompany net receivables resulted in a cash inflow of
approximately $24 million and less than $1 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31, 2004,
respectively. These positive effects may not be indicative of future
effects.

A substantial portion of our net sales is denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In our consolidated financial
statements, we translate our local currency financial results into U.S.
dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting
period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. During times of
a strengthening U.S. dollar, at a constant level of business, our
reported international sales, earnings, assets and liabilities will be
reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S.
dollars. We estimate that the translation effects of changes in the
value of other currencies against the U.S. dollar increased net sales
by approximately 3% for the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
6% for the three months ended March 31, 2004, 7% for the
year ended December 31, 2003 and increased net sales by approximately
2% in 2002. We estimate that the translation effects of changes
in the value of other currencies against the U.S. dollar increased
total assets by approximately 3% for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, decreased total assets by approximately 1%
for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and increased total assets by
approximately 5% in 2003.

In addition to currency
translation risks, we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of
our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales
transaction using a currency different from the operating
subsidiary's functional currency. Given the volatility of
exchange rates, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction
and/or translation risks effectively, or volatility in currency
exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of
operations to a significant additional risk. Since a


portion of our indebtedness is and will be
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, a weakening of the
U.S. dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our
indebtedness.

Significant changes in
pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension
costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension
obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our pension
cost.

Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate
plan assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present value
of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially
affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the
level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the
measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in
the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding
increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, particularly
equity securities, or in a change of the expected rate of return on
plan assets. A change in the discount rate would result in a
significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension
obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans
as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years.
Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in
significant changes in the net periodic pension cost of the following
fiscal years. As of December 31, 2004, our underfunded position related
to our defined benefit pension plans was $636 million. During the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, we contributed approximately $434
million to the plans. During the three months ended March 31, 2004, we
contributed approximately $39 million to the plans.

We have preliminarily recorded a significant
amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, and we may
never realize the full value of our intangible assets.

In
connection with the Transactions, we have recorded a significant amount
of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill and
other net identifiable intangible assets were approximately $1,147
million as of December 31, 2004, or 15% of our total assets
based on preliminary purchase accounting. Goodwill and net identifiable
intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition
and, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, will be reviewed at
least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other
things, deterioration in our performance, adverse market conditions,
adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes
that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services
sold by our business, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any
quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to
results of operations. Depending on future circumstances, it is
possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible
assets. Any future determination of impairment of a significant portion
of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets would have an
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

CAG may be required to make
payments to Hoechst.

Under its 1999 demerger agreement with
Hoechst, CAG agreed to indemnify Hoechst for environmental liabilities
that Hoechst may incur with respect to CAG's German production
sites, which were transferred from Hoechst to CAG in connection with
the demerger. CAG also has an obligation to indemnify Hoechst against
liabilities for environmental damages or contamination arising under
certain divestiture agreements entered into by Hoechst prior to the
demerger. As the indemnification obligations depend on the occurrence
of unpredictable future events, the costs associated with them are not
yet determinable and may materially affect operating results.
CAG's obligation to indemnify Hoechst against liabilities for
environmental contamination in connection with the divestiture
agreements is subject to the following thresholds (translated into U.S.
dollars using the December 31, 2004 exchange rate):

•

CAG will indemnify
Hoechst for the total amount of these liabilities up to
€250 million (approximately $340 million);

•

Hoechst will bear the
full amount of those liabilities between €250 million
(approximately $340  million) and €750 million
(approximately $1,020 million); and


•

CAG
will indemnify Hoechst for one third of those liabilities for amounts
exceeding €750  million (approximately $1,020
million).

CAG has made payments through December 31, 2004 of $38
million for environmental contamination liabilities in connection with
the divestiture agreements, and may be required to make additional
payments in the future. As of December 31, 2004, we have reserves of
approximately $46  million for this contingency, and may be
required to record additional reserves in the future.

Also, CAG
has undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify Hoechst to the
extent that Hoechst is required to discharge liabilities, including tax
liabilities, in relation to assets included in the demerger, where such
liabilities have not been demerged due to transfer or other
restrictions. CAG did not make any payments to Hoechst in 2004 and did
not make any payments in either 2003 or 2002 in connection with this
indemnity.

Under the demerger agreement, CAG will also be
responsible, directly or indirectly, for all of Hoechst's
obligations to past employees of businesses that were demerged to CAG.
Under the demerger agreement, Hoechst agreed to indemnify CAG from
liabilities (other than liabilities for environmental contamination)
stemming from the agreements governing the divestiture of
Hoechst's polyester businesses, which were demerged to CAG,
insofar as such liabilities relate to the European part of that
business. Hoechst has also agreed to bear 80 percent of the financial
obligations arising in connection with the government investigation and
litigation associated with the sorbates industry for price fixing
described in "Legal Proceedings—Sorbates Antitrust
Actions" and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and CAG has agreed to bear the remaining 20 percent.

Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to
interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to
increase significantly and affect our operating results.

Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under the senior
credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to
interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, which we expect to
occur, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness
would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and
our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would
decrease. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $1.1 billion of
variable rate debt. A 1% increase in interest rates would
increase annual interest expense by approximately $11 million.

We may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the
exposure of interest rate risk inherent in our debt portfolio. We have,
in the past, used swaps for hedging purposes only.

Because our Sponsor controls us, the
influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions
will be limited, and conflicts of interest between our Sponsor and us
or you could arise in the future.

Our Sponsor (as defined in
this document) beneficially owns approximately 63% of our
outstanding common stock. As a result, our Sponsor, through its control
over the composition of our board of directors and its control of the
majority of the voting power of our common stock, has effective control
over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and will
have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval
of equityholders regardless of whether or not other equityholders or
noteholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best
interests. For example, our Sponsor effectively could cause us to make
acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or sell revenue-generating
assets. Additionally, our Sponsor is in the business of making
investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold
interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.
Our Sponsor may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be
complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. So long as our Sponsor
continues to own a significant amount of our equity, even if such
amount is less than 50%, it will continue to be able to
significantly influence or effectively control our decisions. Under the
amended and restated shareholders' agreement between us and the
Original Shareholders which are affiliates of the Sponsor, such
Original Shareholders will be entitled to designate all nominees for
election to our board of directors for so long as they hold at least
25% of the total voting power of our common stock. Thereafter,
although our Sponsor will not have an explicit contractual right to do
so, it may still nominate directors in its capacity as a stockholder.


Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy that we have in,
or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, specified
business opportunities.

Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation provides that none of the Original Shareholders
(including the Sponsor) or their affiliates or any director who is not
employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one
of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or
her affiliates has any duty to refrain from (i) engaging in a corporate
opportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or our
affiliates now engage or propose to engage or (ii) otherwise competing
with us. In addition, in the event that any of the Original
Shareholders (including the Sponsor) or any non-employee director
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business
opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for itself or himself
or its or his affiliates and for us or our affiliates, such Original
Shareholder or non-employee director has no duty to communicate or
offer such transaction or business opportunity to us and may take any
such opportunity for themselves or offer it to another person or
entity.

We are a "controlled
company" within the meaning of The New York Stock Exchange
rules and, as a result, are exempt from certain corporate governance
requirements.

Our Sponsor controls a majority of the voting
power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a
"controlled company" within the meaning of
the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. Under the
New York Stock Exchange rules, a company of which more than 50%
of the voting power is held by another company is a
"controlled company" and need not comply with
certain requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of
the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) the
requirement that the nominating committee be composed entirely of
independent directors with a written charter addressing the
committee's purpose and responsibilities, (3)  the
requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of
independent directors with a written charter addressing the
committee's purpose and responsibilities and (4) the requirement
for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate
governance and compensation committees. We utilize these exemptions. As
a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors nor do our
nominating and compensation committees consist entirely of independent
directors. Accordingly, our shareholders do not have the same
protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to
all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance
requirements.

Our future success will
depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property
rights, and our inability to enforce these rights could reduce our
ability to maintain our market position and our margins.

We
attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights and product
designs in order to protect our investment in research and development,
manufacturing and marketing. Our policy is to seek the widest possible
protection for significant product and process developments in its
major markets. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate
products and product uses. Protection for individual products extends
for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application
filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The
protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country,
depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage. Our
continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where
intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to
enforce.

As patents expire, the products and processes described
and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the
public. Our European and U.S. patents for making Sunett, an important
product in our Performance Products segment, expired at the end of the
first quarter of 2005, which will reduce our ability to realize
revenues from making Sunett due to increased competition and potential
limitations and will result in our results of operations and cash flows
relating to the product being less favorable than today.

We also
seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the
brand names of our products, which brand names become more important
once the corresponding patents have expired. If we are not successful
in protecting our trademark rights, our revenues, results of operations
and cash flows may be adversely affected.


The market price
of our common stock and BCP Crystal's public debt may be
volatile, which could cause the value of our shareholders'
investment and the debt holders' investment, respectively, to
decline.

Securities markets worldwide experience significant
price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as
general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the
market price of our common stock and BCP Crystal's public debt in
spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results
could be below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors, and in response, the market price of our common stock and
BCP Crystal's public debt could decrease significantly.

Provisions in our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as any
shareholders' rights plan, may discourage a takeover
attempt.

Provisions contained in our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult
for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial
to our shareholders. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other
requirements, which could make it more difficult for shareholders to
effect certain corporate actions. For example, our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to
determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of
unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our
shareholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue
shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could
adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our Series A
common stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring
a change of control of our company. In addition, a change of control of
our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three
classes of directors (each class elected for a three year term). In
addition, we would be required to issue additional shares of our Series
A common stock to holders of the preferred stock who convert following
a fundamental change. These provisions could limit the price that
certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
our common stock.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
Risks

We are exposed to market risk through commercial and
financial operations. Our market risk consists principally of exposure
to currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The
Predecessor had in place policies of hedging against changes in
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices as
described below. Contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under
SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

amended by SFAS No. 138,

Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities

and SFAS No.
148,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

We and the Predecessor have receivables and payables denominated in
currencies other than the functional currencies of the various
subsidiaries, which create foreign exchange risk. For the purposes of
this document, the Predecessor's reporting currency is the U.S.
dollar, the functional reporting currency of Celanese AG continues to
be the euro. The U.S. dollar, the euro, Mexican peso, Japanese yen,
British pound sterling, and Canadian dollar are the most significant
sources of currency risk. Accordingly, we enter into foreign currency
forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency
fluctuations. The foreign currency contracts are designated for
recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions. The
terms of these contracts are generally under one year. Our centralized
hedging strategy states that foreign currency denominated receivables
or liabilities recorded by the operating entities will be internally
hedged, only the remaining net foreign exchange position will then be
hedged externally with banks. As a result, foreign currency forward
contracts relating to this centralized strategy did not meet the
criteria of SFAS No. 133 to qualify for hedge accounting. Net foreign
currency transaction gains or losses are recognized on the underlying
transactions, which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign
currency forward contracts.

On June  16, 2004, as part of
its currency risk management, the Company entered into a currency swap
with certain financial institutions. Under the terms of the swap
arrangement, the Company will pay


approximately €13
million in interest and receive approximately $16  million in
interest on each June  15 and December  15 (with interest
for the first period prorated). Upon maturity of the swap agreement on
June  16, 2008, the Company will pay approximately
€276  million and receive approximately $333
million. The Company designated the swap, the euro term loan and a euro
note as a net investment hedge (for accounting purposes) in the fourth
quarter of 2004. The loss related to the swap was $21 million for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004, of which $14 million is related to
the ineffectiveness, of the net investment hedge. During the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, the effects of the swap resulted in an
increase in total liabilities and a decrease in shareholder's
equity of $57  million and $36  million, respectively.

Contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $288 million
and $765 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are
predominantly in U.S. dollars, British pound sterling, Japanese yen,
and Canadian dollars. The Company recognizes net foreign currency
transaction gains or losses on the underlying transactions, which are
offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward
contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's
foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total
assets and an increase in total liabilities of $42 million and $2
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, these contracts, in
addition to natural hedges, hedged approximately 100% of the
Company's net receivables held in currencies other than the
entities' functional currency for the Company's European
operations. Related to the unhedged portion during the year, a net gain
(loss) of approximately ($2) million and $4 million from foreign
exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income (expense), net
for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended
March 31, 2004. During 2003, the Predecessor's foreign currency
forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets of $8 million
and an increase in total liabilities of $1 million. As of December 31,
2003, these contracts hedged a portion (approximately 85%) of
the Predecessor's U.S. dollar denominated intercompany net
receivables held by euro denominated entities. Related to the unhedged
portion, a net loss of approximately $14 million from foreign exchange
gains or losses was recorded to other income (expense), net in 2003.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Predecessor hedged all of
its U.S. dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro
denominated entities. Therefore, there was no material net effect from
foreign exchange gains or losses. Receivables yielded cash flows from
operating activities of approximately $24 million, less than $1
million. Hedging activities primarily related to intercompany net
receivables yielded cash flows from operating activities of
approximately $17 million, $180 million and $95 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

A substantial portion of our assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than U.S.
dollar, principally the euro. Fluctuations in the value of these
currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the value of the euro,
can have, and in the past have had, a direct and material impact on the
business and financial results. For example, a decline in the value of
the euro versus the U.S. dollar, results in a decline in the U.S.
dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and earnings due to
translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the euro
versus the U.S. dollar would result in an opposite effect. The Company
estimates that the translation effects of changes in the value of other
currencies against the U.S. dollar increased net sales by approximately
3% and increased total assets by approximately 3% for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004. The Predecessor estimated that the
translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against
the U.S. dollar increased net sales by approximately 6% for the
three months ended March 31, 2004 and by approximately 7% for
the year ended December 31, 2003 and by approximately 2% in
2002. The Predecessor also estimated that the translation effects of
changes in the value of other currencies against the U.S. dollar
decreased total assets by approximately 1% for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and increased total assets by approximately
5% in 2003. Exposure to transactional effects is further reduced
by a high degree of overlap between the currencies in which sales are
denominated and the currencies in which the raw material and other
costs of goods sold are denominated.

As of December 31, 2004, we
had total debt of $3,387 million, of which approximately $610 million
(€447 million) is euro denominated debt. A 1%
increase in foreign exchange rates would increase the euro denominated
debt by $6 million.


Interest Rate Risk
Management

The Company may enter into interest rate swap
agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in the
Company's outstanding debt by locking in borrowing rates to
achieve a desired level of fixed/floating rate debt depending on market
conditions. At December 31, 2004, the Successor had no interest rate
swap agreements in place. The Predecessor had open interest rate swaps
with a notional amount of $200 million at December 31, 2003. In the
second quarter of 2004, the Successor recorded a loss of less than $1
million in other income (expense), net associated with the early
termination of its $200 million interest rate swap. During 2003, the
Predecessor recorded a loss of $7 million in other income (expense),
net, associated with the early termination of one of its interest rate
swaps. The Successor recognized net interest expense from hedging
activities relating to interest rate swaps of $1 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004. The Predecessor recognized net interest
expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of $2
million, $11 million and $12 million for the three months ended March
31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. During 2003,
the Predecessor's interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow
hedges, resulted in a decrease in total assets and total liabilities
and an increase in shareholders' equity of $4 million, $14
million and $7 million, net of related income tax of $4 million,
respectively. The Predecessor recorded a net gain (loss) of less than
($1) million, $2 million and ($3) million in other income (expense),
net of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps, during the
three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

On a pro forma basis, after giving
effect to the Concurrent Financings, as of December 31, 2004, we had
approximately $1,900 million of variable rate debt. A 1%
increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by
approximately $19 million.

Commodity Risk
Management

The Company's policy for the majority of our
natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply
agreements and forward purchase or cash-settled swap contracts. Fixed
price natural gas forward contracts are principally settled through
actual delivery of the physical commodity. The maturities of the
cash-settled swap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the
commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices for the
underlying commodity. Although these contracts are structured to limit
our exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the
potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in
commodity prices. These cash-settled swap contracts are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. Realized gains and losses on these contracts are
included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract.
The Successor recognized losses of less than $1 million from natural
gas swaps and butane contracts for the nine months ended December 31,
2004. The Predecessor recognized losses of $1 million, $3 million and
less than $1 million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for
the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. There was no material impact on the
balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. There were no
unrealized gains and losses associated with the cash-settled swap
contracts as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The Company
did not have any open commodity swaps as of December 31, 2004. The
Company had open swaps with a notional amount of $5 million as of
December 31, 2003.

Item 9A.

Controls and
Procedures

In 2004, certain members of our accounting
staff identified two significant deficiencies in internal controls in
the computation of certain accounting adjustments. These deficiencies
were discovered in addition to, and separate from, the evaluation
process we are conducting in connection with Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, which is further described
below. The first deficiency was identified during the quarter ended
June  30, 2004 by members of our corporate financial reporting
group and related to the qualifications and ability of certain
accounting managers to initially calculate the change from the LIFO
(last-in, first-out) method of accounting for inventories to FIFO
(first-in, first-out) and the resulting failure of such employees to
correctly make such calculations. The second was identified during the
quarter ended June  30, 2004 by one of our financial accounting
managers and related to an omitted employee benefit accrual due to the
failure to provide the applicable employment contracts to the actuary
prior to the cut-off date for the December  31, 2003 pension
valuation. Corrective actions taken by us included an internal audit
review, the development of enhanced guidelines, the termination and
reassignment of responsible persons and an elevation of the issues to
the Supervisory Board of Celanese AG. The significant deficiencies
noted were identified and corrected in the quarter ended
September  30, 2004 and thus did not exist as of December
31, 2004.

On March 30, 2005, we received a letter from KPMG LLP
("KPMG"), our independent auditors,
identifying two material weaknesses. These material weaknesses were
determined in the course of the audit of our financial statements as of
and for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. The first material
weakness related to several deficiencies in the assessment of
effectiveness and documentation of derivative financial instruments.
The required adjustments were made in the proper accounting period, and
we do not believe they had any material impact on previously reported
financial information. The second material weakness was for the same
period and related to conditions preventing our ability to adequately
research, document, review and draw conclusions on accounting and
reporting matters, which resulted in adjustments that had to be
recorded to prevent our financial statements from being materially
misleading. The conditions largely related to significant increases in
the frequency of, and the limited amount of time and technical
accounting resources available to address, complex accounting matters
and transactions and as a result of the consummation of simultaneous
debt and equity offerings during the year-end closing process. In
response to the letter from KPMG, we are increasing the resources
within our finance organization to include experts in the accounting
for derivative financial instruments and in financial reporting,
including tax accounting issues. We are also taking steps to ensure
that adequate time is made available for company personnel to
adequately research, document, review and conclude on accounting and
reporting matters. These initiatives have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to affect materially our internal controls over
financial reporting.

Celanese, under the supervision and with the
participation of Celanese's management, including the chief
executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), performed an
evaluation of the effectiveness of Celanese's
"disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended). Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls
and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that
it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Commission. Based on this
evaluation, and as a result of the foregoing material weaknesses that
were identified, Celanese's CEO and CFO concluded that, as of
December 31, 2004, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report,
Celanese's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
for gathering, analyzing and disclosing the material information
Celanese is required to disclose in the reports it files under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the Commssion. Except as discussed above, there
have been no significant changes in Celanese's
"internal controls over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) during the period covered by this Annual Report that
has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
internal controls over financial reporting.

Beginning with the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2006, Section 404 will require us to
include an internal control report of management with our Annual Report
on Form 10-K. The internal control report must contain (1) a statement
of management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining
adequate


internal control over financial reporting
for us, (2) a statement identifying the framework used by management to
conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting, (3) management's assessment of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of the end of our most recent fiscal year, including a statement as to
whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is
effective, and (4) a statement that our independent auditors have
issued an attestation report on management's assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting.

In connection
therewith, we are currently performing the system and process
evaluation and testing required (and any necessary remediation) in an
effort to comply with the management certification and auditor
attestation requirements of Section  404. In the course of our
ongoing Section  404 evaluation, we have identified areas of
internal controls that may need improvement, and plan to design
enhanced processes and controls to address these and any other issues
that might be identified through this review. As we are still in the
evaluation process, we may identify other conditions that may result in
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future.

We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our
evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the
same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the
requirements of Section  404 in a timely manner or with adequate
compliance or our independent auditors are not able to certify as to
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we
may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities,
such as the Commission. As a result, there could be a negative reaction
in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability
of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur
costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of
additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our
results.

We expect to incur expenses in an aggregate of
approximately $9 million to $14  million in the 2005 fiscal year
in connection with our preparation for compliance with Section
404.

To the Board of
Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Celanese
Corporation and subsidiaries ("Successor") as
of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for
the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed
in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
April 1, 2004 (a convenience date for the April 6, 2004 acquisition
date), a subsidiary of Celanese Corporation acquired 84.3% of
the outstanding stock of Celanese AG in a business combination. As a
result of the acquisition, the consolidated financial information for
the period after the acquisition is presented on a different cost basis
than that for the periods before the acquisition and, therefore, is not
comparable.

Description of the
Company and Change in Ownership

Description of the
Company

Celanese Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively
the "Company" or the
"Successor") is a global industrial chemicals
company, representing the former business of Celanese AG and its
subsidiaries ("CAG" or the
"Predecessor"). The Company's business
involves processing chemical raw materials, such as ethylene and
propylene, and natural products, including natural gas and wood pulp,
into value-added chemicals and chemical-based products.

On
November 3, 2004, Blackstone Crystal Holdings Capital Partners (Cayman)
IV  Ltd., reorganized as a Delaware corporation and changed its
name to Celanese Corporation. Additionally, BCP Crystal Holdings
Ltd.  2, a subsidiary of Celanese Corporation, was reorganized as
a Delaware limited liability company and changed its name to Celanese
Holdings LLC.

Basis of Presentation

The financial
position, results of operations and cash flows and related disclosures
for periods prior to April 1, 2004 (a convenience date for the April 6,
2004 acquisition date), the effective date of the transaction (the
"Effective Date"), are presented as the
results of the Predecessor. The financial position, results of
operations and cash flows subsequent to the Effective Date, are
presented as the results of the Successor as of and for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004.

The consolidated financial statements
of the Successor as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2004
reflect the acquisition of CAG under the purchase method of accounting
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No.  141,

Business Combinations

.

The results of the Successor are
not comparable to the results of the Predecessor due to the difference
in the basis of presentation of purchase accounting as compared to
historical cost. Furthermore, the Successor and the Predecessor have
different accounting policies with respect to certain matters (See Note
4). The consolidated financial statements for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 have been prepared in accordance with CAG's
accounting policies (see Note 4) and the requirements for interim
financial reporting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
("APB") No. 28,

Interim Financial
Reporting

.

Change in Ownership

Pursuant to a
voluntary tender offer commenced in February  2004, Celanese
Europe Holding GmbH  & Co. KG, formerly known as BCP Crystal
Acquisition GmbH  & Co. KG (the
"Purchaser"), an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Celanese Corporation, on April  6, 2004 acquired
approximately 84% of the ordinary shares of Celanese AG,
excluding treasury shares, (the "CAG Shares")
for a purchase price of $1,693  million, including direct
acquisition costs of approximately $69  million (the
"Acquisition"). During the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, the Purchaser acquired additional shares of Celanese
AG for a purchase price of $33 million. As the shares primarily
represented exercised employee stock options, the Purchaser's
ownership percentage remained at approximately 84% as of
December 31, 2004.

Funding for the Acquisition included equity
investments of $641 million from Blackstone Capital Partners
(Cayman)  Ltd. 1, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman)
Ltd. 2, and Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman)  Ltd. 3
(collectively, "Blackstone") and BA Capital
Investors Sidecar Fund, L.P. (and together with Blackstone, the
"Original Shareholders"), term loan
facilities of approximately $608  million, $1,565  million
in borrowings under senior subordinated bridge loan facilities as well
as the issuance of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock totaling
$200  million. In June  2004, BCP Caylux Holdings
Luxembourg S.C.A. ("BCP Caylux"), an indirect
subsidiary of Celanese Corporation, used the proceeds

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

from its offerings of $1,000  million
and €200  million ($244  million) principal
amount of its senior subordinated notes due 2014, together with
available cash and borrowings under a $350  million senior
secured floating rate term loan to repay the senior subordinated bridge
loan facilities, plus accrued interest, and to pay related fees and
expenses. See Notes 16, 18 and 20 for further description of
financings.

Following the completion of the Acquisition, the CAG
Shares were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on June  2,
2004. In addition, a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement
(the "Domination Agreement") between Celanese
AG and the Purchaser was approved by the necessary majority of
shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting held on July
30 and 31, 2004, registered in the Commercial Register on August
2, 2004, and became operative on October  1, 2004. When the
Domination Agreement became operative, the Purchaser became obligated
to offer to acquire all outstanding CAG Shares from the minority
shareholders of Celanese AG in return for payment of fair cash
compensation. The amount of this fair cash compensation has been
determined to be €41.92 per share, plus interest, in
accordance with applicable German law. The total amount of funds
necessary to purchase all of the remaining CAG Shares as of December
31, 2004, assuming all such shares were tendered on or prior to that
date that the Domination Agreement became operative would be at least
€334 million. The Purchaser may elect, or be required, to
pay a purchase price in excess of €41.92 to acquire the
remaining outstanding CAG Shares. Any minority shareholder who elects
not to sell its shares to the Purchaser will be entitled to remain a
shareholder of CAG and to receive from the Purchaser a gross guaranteed
fixed annual payment on its shares of €3.27 per CAG Share
less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any future dividend. Beginning
October  1, 2004, taking into account the circumstances and the
tax rates at the time of entering into the Domination Agreement, the
net guaranteed fixed annual payment would be €2.89 per
share for a full fiscal year. The net guaranteed fixed annual payment
may, depending on applicable corporate tax rates, in the future be
higher, lower or the same as €2.89 per share. In the
fourth quarter of 2004, a charge of approximately $7 million was
recorded for the guaranteed payment.

Beginning October  1,
2004, under the terms of the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser, as
the dominating entity, among other things, is required to compensate
Celanese AG for any statutory annual loss incurred by Celanese AG, the
dominated entity, on a non-consolidated basis, at the end of the fiscal
year when the loss was incurred. This obligation to compensate Celanese
AG for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the
Domination Agreement.

There is no assurance that the Domination
Agreement will remain operative in its current form. If the Domination
Agreement ceases to be operative, the Company will not be able to
directly give instructions to the Celanese AG board of management. The
Domination Agreement cannot be terminated by the Purchaser in the
ordinary course until September 30, 2009. However, irrespective of
whether a domination agreement is in place between the Company and
Celanese AG, under German law Celanese AG is effectively controlled by
the Company because of the Company's approximate 84%
ownership of the outstanding shares of Celanese AG. The Company does
have the ability, through a variety of means, to utilize its
controlling rights as an owner of approximately 84% of the
outstanding shares of Celanese AG, to, among other things, (1)
ultimately cause a domination agreement to become operative; (2)
use its ability, through its approximately 84% voting power at
any shareholders' meetings of Celanese AG, to elect the
shareholder representatives on the supervisory board and to thereby
effectively control the appointment and removal of the members of the
Celanese AG board of management; and (3)  effect all decisions
that an approximately 84% majority shareholder is permitted to
make under German law. The controlling rights of the Company constitute
a controlling financial interest for accounting purposes and result in
the Company being required to consolidate CAG as of the date of
acquisition.

Acquisition of
Celanese

Acquisition of Celanese

As described
further in Note  1, in April  2004, the Purchaser, a
consolidated subsidiary of the Company, acquired financial control of
CAG. The Company has allocated the purchase price on the basis of its
current estimate of the fair value of the underlying assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are reflected at fair value for the approximate 84% portion
acquired and at historical basis for the remaining minority interest of
approximately 16%. Upon completion of the organizational
restructuring in October 2004 (See Note 31), the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed of Celanese Americas Corporation and its
subsidiaries ("CAC") are reflected at fair
value for the 100% portion acquired. The excess of the purchase
price over the amounts allocated to specific assets and liabilities is
included in goodwill. The purchase price allocation is as follows:

Cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, other current assets, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities and other current liabilities were stated at their
historical carrying values, given the short term nature of these assets
and liabilities.

The estimated fair value of inventory, as of
the Effective Date, has been allocated based on management's
computations. The consolidated statement of operations for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 includes $53  million in cost of
sales representing the capitalized manufacturing profit in inventory on
hand as of the Effective Date. The capitalized manufacturing profit was
recorded in purchase accounting and the inventory was subsequently sold
during the nine months ended December 31, 2004.

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Deferred income taxes have been provided
in the consolidated balance sheet based on the Company's estimate
of the tax versus book basis of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Valuation allowances have been established against those
assets for which realization is not likely, primarily in the U.S. (See
Note  22).

The Company's estimate of pension and
other postretirement benefit obligations has been reflected in the
allocation of purchase price at the projected benefit obligation less
plan assets at fair market value.

The Company's estimates
of the fair values of property, plant and equipment, customer and
vendor contracts, other intangible assets, debt, cost and equity method
investments and other assets and liabilities have been reflected in the
Company's financial statements as of December 31, 2004. Included
in other non-current assets above is investments accounted for under
the cost method of accounting whose fair value approximated $220
million at the acquisition date. The estimated remaining useful lives
of the CAG property, plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired
are as follows:

Leasehold
improvements are amortized over 10 years or the remaining term of the
respective lease, whichever is shorter. Assets acquired in business
combinations are recorded at their fair values and depreciated over the
assets' estimated remaining useful life.

In connection
with the Acquisition, at the acquisition date, the Company began
formulating a plan to exit or restructure certain activities. The
Company has not completed this analysis, but has recorded initial
liabilities of $60  million, primarily for employee severance and
related costs in connection with the preliminary plan, as well as
approving the continuation of all existing Predecessor restructuring
and exit plans. As the Company finalizes its plans to exit or
restructure activities, it may record additional liabilities for, among
other things, severance and severance related costs, which would also
increase the goodwill recorded.

The primary reasons for the
Acquisition and the primary factors that contribute to a purchase price
that results in recognition of goodwill
include:

•

leading market position as a
global producer of acetic acid and the world's largest producer
of vinyl acetate monomer.

•

competitive
cost structures, which are based on economies of scale, vertical
integration, technical know-how and the use of advanced
technologies.

•

global reach, with major
operations in North America, Europe and Asia and its extensive network
of ventures, is a competitive advantage in anticipating and meeting the
needs of its global and local customers in well-established and growing
markets, while its geographic diversity mitigates the potential impact
of volatility in any individual country or
region.

•

broad range of products into a
variety of different end-use markets, which helps to mitigate the
potential impact of volatility in any individual end-use market.

Other considerations affecting the value of goodwill
include:

•

the potential to reduce
production and raw material costs further through advanced process
control projects that will help to generate significant savings in
energy and raw materials while increasing yields in production
units.

•

the potential to increase its
cash flow further through increasing productivity, managing trade
working capital, receiving cash dividends from its ventures and
continuing to pursue cost reduction efforts.

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

STATEMENTS

•

the ability of
the assembled workforce to continue to deliver value-added solutions
and develop new products and industry leading production technologies
that solve customer problems.

•

the
potential to optimize the value of the Company's portfolio
further through divestitures, acquisitions and strategic investments
that enable the Company to extend its global market leadership position
and focus on businesses in which it can achieve market, cost and
technology leadership over the long
term.

•

the application of purchase
accounting, particularly for items such as pension and other
postretirement benefits and restructuring activities for which
significant reserve balances were or may be recorded.

Pro Forma
Information

The following pro forma information for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was prepared as if the Acquisition had
occurred as of the beginning of such
period:

Pro forma
adjustments include adjustments for (1)  purchase accounting,
including (i)  the elimination of $53 million in cost of sales
recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of the fair
value adjustment to inventory that was subsequently sold and
(ii)  the application of purchase accounting to pension and other
postretirement obligations (iii)  the application of purchase

Initial Public Offering and Concurrent
Financings

In January 2005, the Company completed an
initial public offering of 50,000,000 shares of Series A common stock
and received net proceeds after deducting underwriters' discounts
and estimated offering expenses of $760 million. Concurrently, the
Company received net proceeds of $233 million from the offering of its
convertible perpetual preferred stock. A portion of the proceeds of the
share offerings were used to redeem $188 million of senior discount
notes and approximately $521 million of senior subordinated notes which
excludes premiums of $19 million and $51 million,
respectively.

Subsequent to the closing of the initial public
offering, the Company borrowed an additional $1,135 million under the
amended and restated senior credit facilities; a portion of which was
used to repay $350 million of a floating rate term loan and $200
million was primarily used to finance the February 2005 acquisition of
the Vinamul emulsion business (see Notes 7 and 16). See Note 16 for
significant terms of the amended and restated Senior Credit
Facilities.

On April 7, 2005, the Company expects to use the
remaining proceeds of the initial public offering and concurrent
financings to pay a special cash dividend to holders of the
Company's Series B common

stock of $804 million which was declared
March 8, 2005. In addition, on March 8, 2005, the Company issued a
7,500,000 Series A common stock dividend to the Original Shareholders
of its Series  B common stock. Upon payment of the $804 million
dividend, the shares of Series B common stock convert automatically to
shares of Series A common stock.

As a result of the offering in
January 2005, the Company now has $240 million aggregate liquidation
preference of outstanding preferred stock. Holders of the preferred
stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if, declared by the
Company's board of directors, out of funds legally available
therefor, cash dividends at the rate of 4.25% per annum of
liquidation preference, payable quarterly in arrears, commencing on May
1, 2005. Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date
of initial issuance. Accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at an
annual rate of 4.25%. The preferred stock is convertible, at the
option of the holder, at any time into one share of Series A common
stock per $25.00 liquidation preference of preferred stock and will be
recorded in shareholders' equity.

Upon completion of the
initial public offering, the Company terminated its advisor monitoring
agreement and paid the Advisor a $35 million termination fee (See Note
6).

Prior to the completion of the initial public offering, the
Company effected a 152.772947 for 1 stock split of the outstanding
shares of Series B common stock.

Summary of
Accounting
Policies

•

Consolidation
principles

The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for all
periods presented and include the accounts of the Company and its
majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control as
well as variable interest entities where the Company is deemed the
primary beneficiary (See Note 5). All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

•

Business combinations

Upon
closing an acquisition, the Company estimates the fair values of assets
and liabilities acquired and consolidate the acquisition as soon as
practicable. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to
finalize the acquired company's balance sheet (frequently with
implications for the purchase price of the acquisition), then to adjust
the acquired company's accounting policies, procedures, books and
records to our standards, it is often several quarters before the
Company is able to finalize those initial fair value estimates.
Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be
subsequently revised.

•

Estimates and
assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting
period. The more significant estimates pertain to purchase price
allocations, impairments of intangible assets and other long-lived
assets, restructuring costs and other special charges, income taxes,
pension and other postretirement benefits, asset retirement
obligations, environmental liabilities, and loss contingencies. Actual
results could differ from those
estimates.

•

Revenue
recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and
risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, generally at the
time of shipment of products, and provided four basic criteria are met:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and
determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Should
changes in conditions cause

F-13

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

management to determine revenue recognition
criteria are not met for certain transactions, revenue recognition
would be delayed until such time that the transactions become
realizable and fully earned. Payments received in advance of revenue
recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.

•

Cash and cash equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less are considered cash
equivalents.

•

Investments in
marketable securities

The Company has classified its
investments in debt and equity securities as
"available-for-sale" and has reported those
investments at their fair or market values in the balance sheet as
other assets. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the related tax effect
on available-for-sale securities, are excluded from earnings and are
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) until realized. The cost of securities sold is determined by
using the specific identification method.

A decline in the
market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is
deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the
carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings
and a new cost basis for the security is established. To determine
whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers
whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a
market price recovery and evidence indicating the cost of the
investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence
considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment,
the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value
subsequent to year-end, and forecasted performance of the
investee.

•

Financial
instruments

The Company addresses certain financial
exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes
the use of derivative financial instruments (see Note 26). As a matter
of principle, the Company does not use derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes. The Company has been party to interest rate swaps
as well as foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposures. The Company
generally utilizes interest rate derivative contracts in order to fix
or limit the interest paid on existing variable rate debt. The Company
utilizes foreign currency derivative financial instruments to eliminate
or reduce the exposure of its foreign currency denominated receivables
and payables, which includes the Company's exposure on its dollar
denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated
entities. Additionally, the Company has utilized derivative instruments
to reduce the exposure of its commodity prices and stock compensation
expense.

The Company also uses derivative and non-derivative
financial instruments that may give rise to foreign currency
transaction gains or losses, to hedge the foreign currency exposure of
a net investment in a foreign operation. The effective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative and the foreign currency gain or loss on
the non-derivative financial instrument is recorded as a currency
translation adjustment in other comprehensive income
(loss).

Differences between amounts paid or received on interest
rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense
over the life of each swap, thereby adjusting the effective interest
rate on the hedged obligation. Gains and losses on instruments not
meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, or that
cease to meet hedge accounting criteria, are included as income or
expense.

If a swap is terminated prior to its maturity, the gain
or loss is recorded to other income (expense), net and recognized over
the remaining original life of the swap if the item hedged remains
outstanding, or immediately, if the item hedged does not remain
outstanding. If the swap is not terminated prior to maturity, but the
underlying hedged item is no longer outstanding, the interest rate swap
is marked to market and any unrealized gain or loss is recognized
immediately.

Gains and losses on derivative instruments as well
as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged items are reported in
earnings in the same accounting period. Gains and losses relating to
the ineffective

F-14

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

portion of hedges are recorded in other
income (expense), net. Foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges
for anticipated exposures are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with the
contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying hedged transactions
affect earnings. Derivative instruments that are not designated as
hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with
the results included in earnings.

The Company's risk
management policy for the majority of its natural gas and butane
requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward
purchase or cash-settled swap contracts. As of December 31, 2004, there
were no derivative contracts outstanding. In 2003, there were forward
contracts covering approximately 35% of the Company's
Chemical Products segment North American requirements. Management
regularly assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its
commodity requirements forward and the utilization of a variety of
other raw material hedging instruments, in addition to forward purchase
contracts, in accordance with changes in market conditions. The fixed
price natural gas forward contracts and any premium associated with the
purchase of a price cap are principally settled through actual delivery
of the physical commodity. The maturities of the cash-settled swap or
cap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and
have the effect of securing or limiting predetermined prices for the
underlying commodity. Although these contracts were structured to limit
exposure to increases in commodity prices, certain swaps may also limit
the potential benefit the Company might have otherwise received from
decreases in commodity prices. These cash-settled swap contracts were
accounted for as cash flow hedges. Realized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of
the contract. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses
associated with the cash-settled swap contracts are deferred as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the
underlying hedged transactions affect earnings.

The Predecessor
selectively used call options to offset some of the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in
the Company's stock price related to its stock appreciation
rights plans. The options are designated as cash flow hedging
instruments. The Predecessor excluded the time value component from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in the call
option's time value is reported each period in interest expense.
The intrinsic value of the option contracts is deferred as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the compensation
expense associated with the underlying hedged transactions affect
earnings.

Financial instruments which could potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily receivables
concentrated in various geographic locations and cash equivalents. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition. Generally, collateral is not required from
customers. Allowances are provided for specific risks inherent in
receivables.

•

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out or FIFO method. Cost includes
raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Stores and
supplies are valued at cost or market, whichever is lower. Cost is
generally determined by the average cost method.

F-15

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Upon Acquisition, the Predecessor changed
its inventory valuation method of accounting for its U.S. subsidiaries
from the last-in, first-out or LIFO method to the first-in, first-out
method or FIFO method to be consistent with the Successor's
accounting policy. This change will more closely represent the physical
flow of goods resulting in ending inventory which will better represent
the current cost of the inventory and the costs in income will more
closely match the flow of goods. The financial statements of the
Predecessor have been adjusted for all periods presented to reflect
this change. The impact of this change on the Predecessor's
reported net earnings and earnings per share for the three months ended
March  31,  2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 is as follows:

•

Deferred financing
costs

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred to
obtain debt financings and amortizes these costs over the terms of the
related debt. Upon the extinguishment of the related debt, any
unamortized capitalized debt financing costs are immediately expensed.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the Successor recorded
amortization of deferred financing costs, which is classified in
interest expense, of $98  million, of which $89 million related
to accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with
the $1,565  million bridge loans and the $200  million
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. As of December 31, 2004, the
Successor has $105  million of deferred financing costs included
within long term other assets. As of December 31, 2003, the Predecessor
had $5 million of deferred financing costs included within long-term
other assets.

•

Investments and
equity in net earnings of affiliates

Accounting Principles
Board ("APB") Opinion No. 18,

The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

, stipulates
that the equity method should be used to account for investments in
corporate joint ventures and certain other companies when an investor
has "the ability to exercise significant influence over
operating and financial policies of an investee". APB
Opinion No. 18 generally considers an investor to have the ability to
exercise significant influence when it owns 20 percent or more of the
voting stock of an investee. FASB Interpretation No. 35,

Criteria
for Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
Stock

, which was issued to clarify the criteria for applying the
equity method of accounting to 50 percent or less owned companies,
lists circumstances under which, despite 20 percent ownership, an
investor may not be able to exercise significant influence. Certain
investments where the Company owns greater than a 20 percent ownership
and can not exercise

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

significant influence or control are
accounted for under the cost method. Such investments aggregate $186
million and $76 million as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
respectively, and are included within long-term other assets.

In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 142, adopted by the Predecessor
effective January 1, 2002, the excess of cost over underlying equity in
net assets acquired is no longer amortized.

The Company assesses
the recoverability of the carrying value of its investments whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate a loss in value that is
other than a temporary decline. See "Impairment of
property, plant and equipment" for explanation of the
methodology utilized.

•

Property,
plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are
capitalized at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives of the
assets.

Leasehold improvements are amortized
over 10 years or the remaining life of the respective lease, whichever
is shorter. Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at
their fair values and depreciated over the assets' remaining
useful life or the life of the Company's policy, whichever is
shorter.

Repair and maintenance costs, including costs for
planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not extend the useful life of
the asset are charged against earnings as incurred. Major replacements,
renewals and significant improvements are capitalized.

Interest
costs incurred during the construction period of assets are applied to
the average value of constructed assets using the estimated weighted
average interest rate incurred on borrowings outstanding during the
construction period. The interest capitalized is amortized over the
life of the asset.

Impairment of property, plant and
equipment

– the Company assesses the recoverability of the
carrying value of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The estimate of fair value
may be determined as the amount at which the asset could be bought or
sold in a current transaction between willing parties. If this
information is not available, fair value is determined based on the
best information available in the circumstances. This frequently
involves the use of a valuation technique including the present value
of expected future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved, or other acceptable valuation techniques. Impairment
of property, plant and equipment to be disposed of is determined in a
similar manner, except that fair value is reduced by the costs to
dispose of the assets (See Note 12).

•

Intangible assets

Beginning in 2002, the excess of the purchase price over fair value
of net identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired business
("goodwill") and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for
impairment at least annually. Patents, trademarks and other intangibles
with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated economic lives.

Impairment of intangible assets

– the Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value
of its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.

F-17

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Recoverability of goodwill is measured at
the reporting unit level based on a two-step approach. First, the
carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as
estimated by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying value
of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a
second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit's assets and
liabilities are fair valued. To the extent that the reporting
unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value
of goodwill, impairment exists and must be recognized. The implied fair
value of goodwill is calculated as the fair value of the reporting unit
in excess of the fair value of all non-goodwill assets and liabilities
allocated to the reporting unit. The estimate of fair value may be
determined as the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in
a current transaction between willing parties. If this information is
not available, fair value is determined based on the best information
available in the circumstances. This frequently involves the use of a
valuation technique including the present value of expected future cash
flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved, or
other acceptable valuation techniques.

Recoverability of other
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the fair
value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying
value of the intangible assets over the fair value of the intangible
assets is recognized as an impairment loss. The estimate of fair value
is determined similar to that for goodwill outlined above.

The
Company assesses the recoverability of intangible assets with finite
lives in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. See
"Impairment of property, plant and
equipment".

•

Income
taxes

The provision for income taxes has been determined
using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences
is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as
applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax
jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date.

The Company
reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a
valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected
future taxable income, applicable tax strategies, and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation
allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

•

Environmental
liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse
line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly, the
Company's operations are subject to various hazards incidental to
the production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling,
processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. The
Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating to
environmental matters if available information indicates it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. If the event of a loss is neither probable nor
reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible, the Company provides
appropriate disclosure in the notes to its consolidated financial
statements if the contingency is material. The Company estimates
environmental liabilities on a case-by-case basis using the most
current status of available facts, existing technology and presently
enacted laws and regulations. Environmental liabilities for which the
remediation period is fixed and associated costs are readily
determinable are recorded at their net present value. Recoveries of
environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as
assets when their receipt is deemed probable (See Note
19).

Legal
Fees

The Company accrues for legal fees related to
litigation matters when the costs associated with defending these
matters can be reasonably estimated and are probable of occurring. All
other legal fees are expensed as
incurred.

•

Minority
interests

Minority interests in the equity and results of
operations of the entities consolidated by the Company are shown as a
separate item in the consolidated financial statements. As a result of
the Company's ownership interest in Celanese AG, the Successor
recorded approximately 16% of the equity and results of
operations of Celanese AG as minority interest as of, and for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004. In addition to the Company's
ownership interest in Celanese AG, additional entities included in the
consolidated financial statements that have minority interests at
December 31, 2004 are as
follows:

The Company has a 60 percent voting
interest and the right to appoint a majority of the board of management
of Synthesegasanlage Ruhr GmbH, which results in the Company
controlling this entity and, accordingly, the Predecessor and Successor
are consolidating this entity in their consolidated financial
statements.

Dacron GmbH and Pemeas GmbH are variable interest
entities as defined under FASB Interpretation
("FIN") No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.

The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of
these variable interest entities and, accordingly, consolidates these
entities in its consolidated financial statements (See Note
5).

•

Accounting for Sorbates
Matters

On October 22, 1999, Celanese AG was demerged from
Hoechst AG ("Hoechst"). In accordance with
the demerger agreement between Hoechst and Celanese AG, Celanese AG
then new owner to Hoechst's sorbates business, was assigned the
obligation related to the Sorbates matters. However, Hoechst agreed to
indemnify Celanese AG for 80 percent of payments for such obligations.
Expenses related to this matter are recorded gross of any such
recoveries from Hoechst, and its legal successors, in the consolidated
statement of operations. Recoveries from Hoechst, and its legal
successors, which represent 80 percent of such expenses, are recorded
directly to shareholders' equity (deficit), net of tax, as a
contribution of capital in the consolidated balance sheet.

Research and development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense in
the period in which they are
incurred.

Functional and reporting
currencies

For the Company's international operations
where the functional currency is other than the U.S. Dollar, assets and
liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates, while the
statement of operations amounts are translated using the average
exchange rates for the respective period. Differences arising from the
translation of assets and liabilities in comparison with the
translation of the previous periods or from initial recognition during
the period are included as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).

Earnings per share

Basic
earnings per share is based on the net earnings divided by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per shares is based on the net earnings divided by the

Stock-based
compensation

As permitted by SFAS No.  123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

("SFAS
No.  123"), the Successor accounts for employee
stock-based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No.  25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

("APB
No.  25"), using an intrinsic value approach to
measure compensation expense, if any.

For the three months ended
March  31, 2004, and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
the Predecessor accounted for stock options and similar equity
instruments under the fair value method, which requires compensation
cost to be measured at the grant date based on the value of the award.
The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the
grant date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the
volatility and the expected dividends of the underlying stock, and the
risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option.
Compensation expense based on the fair value of stock options is
recorded over the vesting period of the options and has been recognized
in the Predecessor consolidated financial statements. The Celanese AG
stock options do not contain changes in control provisions, which would
have resulted in accelerated vesting, as a result of the Acquisition
(See Note  23).

Compensation expense for stock appreciation
rights, either partially or fully vested, is recorded based on the
difference between the base unit price at the date of grant and the
quoted market price of Celanese AG's common stock on the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange at the end of the period proportionally
recognized over the vesting period and adjusted for previously
recognized expense (See Note 23).

The following table
illustrates the effect on net earnings (loss) if the Successor had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based employee compensation for the nine months ended December
31,
2004:

Accounting Changes and Pronouncements

Accounting Changes Adopted in 2004

During 2004, the
Predecessor changed its inventory valuation method of accounting for
its US subsidiaries from the LIFO method to the FIFO method to conform
with the Successor's accounting policy. The Predecesor's
financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to
reflect this change (See Note 4).

In January  2003, and
subsequently revised in December  2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation ("FIN") No.  46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

and FIN No.
46 Revised (collectively "FIN No.
46"). FIN No.  46 clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No.  51,
"

Consolidation of Financial
Statements

" requiring the consolidation of certain
variable interest entities ("VIEs") which are
defined as entities having equity that is not sufficient to permit such
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinate
financial support or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics
of a controlling financial interest. The company deemed to be the
primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE. FIN No.
46 requires VIEs that meet the definition of a special purpose entity
to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary as of December  31,
2003. For pre-existing VIEs that do not meet the definition of a
special purpose entity, consolidation is not required until
March  31, 2004. At March  31, 2004, upon adoption of FIN
No.  46, the Predecessor did not identify any VIEs other than the
VIE disclosed below.

The Company has a lease agreement for its
cyclo-olefin copolymer ("COC") plant with
Dacron GmbH, a special purpose entity. This special purpose entity was
created primarily for the purpose of constructing and subsequently
leasing the COC plant to the Company. This arrangement qualifies as a
VIE. Based upon the terms of the lease agreement and the residual value
guarantee Celanese provided to the lessors, the Company is deemed the
primary beneficiary of the VIE. At December  31, 2003, the
Predecessor recorded $44  million of additional assets and
liabilities from the consolidation of this special purpose entity.

In April 2004, the Company and a group of investors led by Conduit
Ventures Ltd. entered into a venture, which was named Pemeas GmbH. This
venture was formed in order to advance the commercialization of the
Company's fuel cell technology. Pemeas GmbH is considered a
variable interest entity as defined under FIN No. 46. The Company is
deemed the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity and,
accordingly, consolidates this entity in its consolidated financial
statements. The consolidation of this entity did not have a material
impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations and cash flows for the nine months ended December 31,
2004.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") reached a consensus on Issue No.
03-01,

Other than Temporary Impairment

, which outlines the basic
model to be used to evaluate whether an investment is impaired and sets
the disclosure requirements for such investments. EITF  Issue No.
03-1 is to be applied prospectively in periods beginning after
June  15, 2004. The Company has applied the provisions of EITF
Issue No. 03-01 in the current reporting period with no material impact
on the Company's financial position or results of operations and
cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2004.

On
December  8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Medicare
Act") was signed into law. The Act introduces a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare ("Medicare
Part  D") as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors
of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part  D. As of
March  31, 2004, as permitted by FASB Staff Position

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003,

the Company deferred accounting for the
effects of the Act in the measurement of its Accumulated Postretirement
Benefit Obligation (APBO) and the effect to net periodic postretirement
benefit costs. Specific guidance with respect to accounting for the
effects of the Act was recently issued in FSP No.  106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,

and
the Company has adopted the provisions of FSP No.  106-2 as of
the Effective Date, and included any impact in the overall measurement
of the liabilities of the U.S. postretirement medical plans in purchase
accounting.

Accounting Changes Adopted in 2003

The Predecessor adopted SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,

on January  1, 2003. The statement
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The
liability is measured at its discounted fair value and is adjusted to
its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is
recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as
part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. On January 1, 2003, the
Predecessor recognized transition amounts for existing asset retirement
obligation liabilities, associated capitalized costs and accumulated
depreciation. An after-tax transition charge of $1 million was recorded
as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The ongoing expense
on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143
is immaterial (See Note 15). The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143
on proforma net income and proforma earnings per share for prior
periods presented is not material.

In November 2002, the EITF
reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables

. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on
how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or
performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.
The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 apply to revenue arrangements
entered into after June 30, 2003.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities

. SFAS No. 149 is intended to result in more
consistent reporting of contracts as either freestanding derivative
instruments subject to SFAS No. 133 in their entirety, or as hybrid
instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features.
In addition, SFAS No. 149 clarifies the definition of a derivative by
providing guidance on the meaning of initial net investments related to
derivatives. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have
a material effect on the Predecessor's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the EITF reached
a consensus on Issue No. 01-8,

Determining Whether an Arrangement
Contains a Lease

. EITF Issue No. 01-8 provides guidance on
identifying leases contained in contracts or other arrangements that
sell or purchase products or services. This consensus is effective
prospectively for contracts entered into or significantly modified
after May 28, 2003. The impact of EITF Issue No. 01-8 did not have a
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position
or results of operations. The impact of EITF Issue No. 01-8 on the
Company's future results of operations and financial position
will depend on the terms contained in contracts signed or contracts
amended in the future.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 104,

Revenue
Recognition

. The SAB updates portions of the interpretive guidance
included in Topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins
in order to make the guidance consistent with current authoritative
accounting literature. The principal revisions relate to the
incorporation of certain sections of the staff's frequently asked
questions document on revenue recognition into Topic 13. The adoption
of SAB 104 did not have an effect on the Predecessor's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised),

Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits

. SFAS No. 132 (revised) prescribes employers'
disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;
it does not change the measurement or recognition

F-22

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

of those plans. The statement retains and
revises the disclosure requirements contained in the original SFAS No.
132. It also requires additional disclosures about the assets,
obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined
benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The
statement generally is effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2003. The Company's disclosures in Note 17 incorporate the
requirements of SFAS No. 132 (revised).

Accounting Changes
Adopted in 2002

In 2002, the Predecessor recorded income of
$18 million for the cumulative effect of two accounting changes. This
amount consisted of income of $9 million ($0.18 per share) from the
implementation of SFAS No. 142, as disclosed below, and income of $9
million ($0.18 per share), net of income taxes of $5 million, as a
result of the change in the measurement date of the Predecessor's
U.S. benefit plans (See Note 17).

Effective January 1, 2002, the
Predecessor adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, and accordingly applied the standards of the statement
prospectively. This statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and
provides that goodwill and some intangibles no longer be amortized on a
recurring basis. Instead, goodwill and intangible assets with an
indefinite life are subject to an initial impairment test within six
months of adoption of SFAS No. 142 and at least annually
thereafter.

As of January 1, 2002, the Predecessor had goodwill
with a net carrying value of $1,024 million that was subject to the
transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. During the first half of 2002,
the Predecessor performed the required impairment tests of goodwill as
of January 1, 2002 and determined that there was no impairment. Other
intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their
useful lives and reviewed for impairment.

Additionally, SFAS No.
142 requires that any unamortized negative goodwill (excess of fair
value over cost) on the balance sheet be written off immediately and
classified as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in
the consolidated statement of operations. As a result, income of $9
million was recorded to cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles in the Predecessor's consolidated statement of
operations in the first quarter of 2002 (See Note 13).

The
Predecessor adopted SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Asset

s, on January 1, 2002, and accordingly
applied the statement prospectively. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No.
121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

. The Statement also supersedes
APB No. 30,

Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the
Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions

. This
Statement establishes a single accounting model to test impairment,
based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale. The Statement retains most of the
requirements in SFAS No. 121 related to the recognition of impairment
of long-lived assets to be held and used. Additionally, SFAS No. 144
extends the applicability to discontinued operations, and broadens the
presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an
entity. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material effect on
the Predecessor's consolidated financial statements.

Effective October 2002, the Predecessor early adopted SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,

and accordingly applied the Statement prospectively to exit or
disposal activities initiated after September 30, 2002. The statement
nullifies EITF Issue No.  94-3,

Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

. The
principal difference between SFAS No.  146 and EITF Issue
No. 94-3 relates to the criteria for recognition of a liability for a
cost associated with an exit or disposal activity.

F-23

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

SFAS No. 146 requires recognition only
when the liability is incurred. In contrast, under EITF Issue
No. 94-3, a liability was recognized when the Company committed to an
exit plan. Additionally, SFAS No. 146 stipulates that the liability be
measured at fair value and be adjusted for changes in cash flow
estimates.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45,

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others

, which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in
its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under
guarantees. These disclosure requirements are included in Note 27. FIN
No. 45 also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at
the inception of certain guarantees entered into or modified subsequent
to adoption.

FIN No. 45 requires the guarantor to recognize a
liability for the non-contingent component of the guarantee, this is
the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified
triggering events or conditions occur. The initial measurement of this
liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception. The
recognition of a liability is required even if it is not probable that
payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was
issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple
elements. As noted above, the Predecessor has adopted the disclosure
requirements of FIN No. 45 and applied the recognition and measurement
provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after December
31, 2002.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs,
amendment to ARB No. 43 Chapter 4

, which clarifies the accounting
for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs,
and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is in the process of
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 151 on its future results of
operations and financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB
revised SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

,
which requires that the cost from all share-based payment transactions
be recognized in the financial statements. SFAS No. 123 (revised) is
effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June
15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of
SFAS No. 123 (revised), although it is anticipated that the adoption
will have a negative impact on results of operations.

In
December  2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.  153,

Exchanges
of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No.  29,
Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

. The amendments made by
SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with
a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
have commercial substance. The statement is effective for nonmonetary
asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June
15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of
issuance. The provisions of this statement shall be applied
prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
of this statement.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law.
Three of the more significant provisions of the Act relate to a
one-time opportunity to repatriate foreign earnings at a reduced rate,
manufacturing benefits for qualified production activity income and new
requirements with respect to deferred compensation plans. The Company
has not yet determined the impact, if any, of this Act on its future
results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, under new Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code, created in connection with the Act,
the U.S. Treasury Department is directed to issue regulations providing
guidance and provide a limited period during which deferred
compensation plans may be amended to comply with the requirements of
Section 409A. When the regulations are issued, the Company may be
required to make modifications to certain compensation plans to comply
with Section 409A.

Acquisitions:

•

On
April 6, 2004, the Company acquired CAG (See Notes 1 and
2).

•

On December 31, 2002, the
Predecessor acquired Clariant AG's European emulsions and
worldwide emulsion powders businesses, valued at $154 million,
including the assumption of related liabilities. Net of purchase price
adjustments of $2 million and the assumption of liabilities of $21
million, the Predecessor paid $131 million cash for the net assets of
the business in 2002. In 2003, the purchase price adjustment related to
the acquisition was finalized, which resulted in the Predecessor making
an additional payment of $7 million. The addition of this business to
the Chemical Products segment enabled the Predecessor to offer a
comprehensive range of value-added emulsions and emulsion powders that
serve as the primary ingredients in quality surface coatings,
adhesives, non-woven textiles and other applications. The emulsions and
emulsion powders business has four production facilities servicing the
product requirements of customers across Europe. There are also 11
sales offices and seven research and technology centers, located to
provide rapid response to customers. Two of the production facilities
are located in Germany and Spain, in close proximity to the
Company's plants that supply chemical ingredients for emulsions.
The Predecessor recorded $35 million of initial goodwill in 2002, which
was subsequently reduced by $24 million upon completion of the purchase
price allocation in 2003. In addition, the fair value of the intangible
assets acquired was $42 million, consisting primarily of patents and
trademarks (See Note 13).

•

On
October  27, 2004, the Company agreed to acquire Acetex
Corporation ("Acetex"), a Canadian
corporation, for approximately $261  million and the assumption
by the Company of debt owed by Acetex, valued at approximately

approved the transaction. Presently, Acetex has two primary
businesses—its Acetyls business and its Specialty Polymers and
Films business. The Acetyls business produces acetic acid, polyvinyl
alcohol and vinyl acetate monomer, which are used to produce paints,
coatings, adhesives, textiles and other products. These chemicals and
their derivatives are used in a wide range of applications in the
automotive, construction, packaging, pharmaceutical and textile
industries. Specialty polymers developed and manufactured by Acetex are
used in the manufacture of a variety of plastics products, including
packaging and laminating products, auto parts, adhesives and medical
products. The Films business focuses on products for the agricultural,
horticultural and construction industries. Closing of the acquisition
is conditioned upon regulatory approvals and other customary
conditions. In connection with the funding of this acquisition, the
Company expects to borrow $242 million under the delayed draw
acquisition facility provided for in the amended and restated senior
credit facilities (See Note
16).

•

In February 2005, the
Company acquired Vinamul Polymers, the North American and European
emulsion polymer business of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC

In September
2003, the Predecessor and The Dow Chemical Company
("Dow") reached an agreement for Dow to
purchase the acrylates business of the Predecessor. This transaction
was completed in February 2004 for a sales price of approximately $149
million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $14 million
in the three months ended March 31, 2004. Dow acquired the
Predecessor's acrylates business line, including inventory,
intellectual property and technology for crude acrylic acid, glacial
acrylic acid, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, methyl acrylate and
2-ethylhexyl acrylate, as well as acrylates production assets at the

certain contract manufacturing services to Dow, and Dow supplies
acrylates to the Company for use in its emulsions production.
Simultaneous with the sale, the Predecessor repaid an unrelated
obligation of $95 million to Dow. The acrylates business was part of
the Predecessor's Chemical business. As a result of this
transaction, the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to
the acrylates product lines at the Clear Lake, Texas facility as well
as the gain recorded on the sale are reflected as a component of
discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No. 144.

$40 million for discontinued operations, which includes a tax benefit
associated with a tax deductible write down of the tax basis for
Trespaphan's subsidiary in Germany relating to tax years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000. Since this tax benefit relates to an entity
solely engaged in a business designated as discontinued operations,

Estech
GmbH & Co. KG is a venture created in 2002 for the production and
marketing of neopolyol esters. The Company accounts for its ownership
interest in Estech GmbH & Co. KG under the equity method of
accounting because the minority shareholder has substantive
participating rights that allow it to participate in significant
decisions made in the ordinary course of business.

In October
2003, the Predecessor and Degussa completed the formation of European
Oxo Chemicals GmbH, a venture created to own and operate the European
propylene-based oxo businesses of the Predecessor and Degussa (See Note

The Company accounts for its ownership interest in
Sherbrooke Capital Health and Wellness, L.P. under the equity method of
accounting because the Company is able to exercise significant
influence.

In addition to equity method investments, the Company
has certain investments that it accounts for under the cost method of

December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In the first quarter
of 2004, as part of the acrylates divestiture, the Predecessor entered
into a site agreement with Dow to allow Dow to use certain property,
plant, and equipment. As the agreement met the stipulations of a
capital lease under EITF Issue No. 01-8,

related to property, plant and equipment into other long-term
receivables.

In December 2004, the Company approved a plan to
sell its COC business and recorded an impairment charge of $32 million

In October 2004, the
Company announced plans to consolidate its tow production to fewer
sites by 2007 and to discontinue the production of acetate filament by
mid-2005. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded
restructuring charges of $50 million related to asset impairment of the
Company's acetate business.

At December 31, 2003, the
consolidation of a variable interest entity, Dacron GmbH, resulted in
the recording of $53 million in net property, plant and equipment.

Predecessor contributed property, plant, and equipment with a net book
value of $7 million to European Oxo GmbH.

In 2003, the purchase
price allocation associated with the December 2002 acquisition of the
Emulsions business was finalized. As a result, property, plant and
equipment was increased by $35 million.

As of January 1, 2003,
the Predecessor adopted SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, and recognized transition amounts for
existing asset retirement obligations and corresponding capitalized
costs and accumulated depreciation. Upon adoption, the Predecessor
recorded $8 million in land and land improvements, and a corresponding
$5 million in accumulated depreciation. In addition, in the fourth
quarter of 2003, the Predecessor assigned a probability that certain
facilities in the Acetate products segment would close in the latter
half of this decade and the Predecessor recorded $10 million in land
and land improvements and $1 million in machinery and equipment as well
as a corresponding $11 million in accumulated depreciation.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Successor

As a result of the Acquisition and Restructuring, the Company
performed purchase price allocations and recorded goodwill of
$747  million. (See Notes 2 and 31).

Predecessor

Effective January 1, 2002, the Predecessor adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, and accordingly applied
the standards of the statement prospectively. This statement provides
that goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life no
longer be amortized, rather they will be tested at least annually for
impairment. Additionally, the adoption of SFAS No. 142 required that
any unamortized negative goodwill (excess of fair value over cost) on
the balance sheet be written off immediately and classified as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated
statement of operations. As a result, income of $9 million was recorded
to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in the
Predecessor's consolidated statement of operations in the first
quarter of 2002.

Successor

The Company has
estimated the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the
Acquisition, as
follows:

Aggregate
amortization expense charged against earnings for intangible assets
with finite lives during the nine months ended December  31, 2004
totaled $38  million. Estimated amortization expense for the
succeeding five fiscal years is approximately $49 million in 2005, $48
million in 2006, $47 million in 2007, $44 million in 2008 and $42
million in 2009. The Company has trademarks and tradenames of $68
million which have an indefinite life. Accordingly, no amortization is
recorded on these intangible assets.

Predecessor

The
Predecessor's cost and accumulated amortization of other
intangible assets, primarily related to the emulsion acquisition, as of
December  31, 2003 were $67  million and $31
million, respectively. Aggregate amortization expense charged against
earnings for intangible assets with finite lives during the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 totaled $2 million, $11 million and $2 million, respectively.
Predecessor's intangible assets subject to amortization have a
weighted average life of five years.

In 2003, it was determined
that of the other intangible assets acquired in the emulsions
acquisition, $7 million represents a trademark which has an indefinite
life and is not subject to amortization. Accordingly, since 2003
amortization expense was not recorded for this
trademark.

As

million and $137 million, respectively, of liabilities related to
sorbates matters (See Note 27).

As of December 31, 2003, the
Other caption above includes a reclassification from Other liabilities
of approximately $56 million in anticipation of an early payment of an
obligation under a separate agreement with Dow, which was accelerated
upon the close of the sale of the acrylates business. As of December

this matter was $95 million, including interest. This amount was paid
in February 2004 (See Note 7).

Other
Liabilities

Prior to
the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the Predecessor had $33 million of post
closure liabilities included within environmental liabilities. As
provided under SFAS No. 143, such amounts were reversed, and $39
million of asset retirement obligations were established. As of
December 31, 2004, estimated liabilities for asset retirement
obligations were approximately $52 million, of which $42 million is
included as a component of other long-term liabilities included in the
Other caption above. This amount primarily represents the
Company's estimated future liability for site demolition and for
various landfill closures and the associated monitoring costs at these
operating sites.

Changes in asset retirement obligations
are reconciled as
follows:

In
October  2004, the Company announced plans to consolidate its tow
production to fewer sites by 2007 and to discontinue the production of
acetate filament by mid-2005. The restructuring is being implemented to
increase efficiency, reduce overcapacity and to focus on products and
markets that provide long-term value. The establishment of $12 million
in asset retirement obligations resulted in a corresponding charge to
depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2004.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Predecessor assigned a
probability that facilities in the Acetate Products segment will close.
These facilities were previously deemed to have indeterminable lives.
As a result, the Predecessor recorded depreciation expense of $11
million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The Company has
identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to
substantially all of its existing operating facilities. Examples of
these types of obligations include demolition, decommissioning,
disposal and restoration activities. Legal obligations exist in
connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the
facilities or abandonment of the existing operations. However, the
Company currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities
indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot
be determined at this time. In the event the Company considers plans to
abandon or cease operations at these sites, an asset retirement
obligation will be reassessed at that time. If certain operating
facilities were to close, the related asset retirement obligations
could significantly affect the Company's results of operations
and cash flows.

Debt

In
connection with the acquisition of CAG, the Company borrowed
$1,565  million under the senior subordinated bridge loan
facilities, which were repaid in June  2004 through the issuance
of: (a)  $1.0  billion, 9.625% senior subordinated
notes due in 2014; (b) € 200  million
($244  million), 10.375% senior subordinated notes due in
2014; and (c)  $350  million floating rate term loan due in
2011. Additionally, the Company entered into senior credit facilities
in April 2004, which provided financings of up to approximately
$1.2  billion. As a result of the acquisition of CAG, the Company
prepaid, in April 2004, $175 million of debt scheduled to mature in
2005 and 2008 and, in September 2004, prepaid approximately $60 million
of additional pre-acquisition debt of CAG previously scheduled to
mature in 2009.

In July 2004, the Company issued $225 million in
9.625% senior subordinated notes for cash proceeds of $231.
These proceeds were used to repay mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock (See Note 18).

In January 2005, the Company amended and
restated these senior credit facilities, which now provide borrowings
of up to approximately $2.8 billion, including a delayed draw
acquisition facility of $242 million and repaid the $350 million
floating rate term loan. In February 2005, the Company redeemed $521
million of the senior subordinated notes and $188 million of the
Company's senior discount notes (See Note  3).

Senior Credit Facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, the
senior credit facilities of $1,232 million consist of a term loan
facility, a revolving credit facility and a credit-linked revolving
facility.

The term loan facility consists of commitments of $454
million and €125 million, both maturing in 2011. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company borrowed $624 million (including
€125 million) under the term loan facility.

The
revolving credit facility, through a syndication of banks, provides for
borrowings of up to $380 million, including the availability of letters
of credit in U.S. dollars and euros and for borrowings on same-day
notice. As of December 31, 2004, there were no amounts outstanding
under the revolving credit facility, which matures in 2009.

Subsequent to the consummation of the initial public offering in
January 2005, the Company entered into amended and restated senior
credit facilities. The terms of the amended and restated senior credit
facilities are substantially similar to the terms of the
Company's existing senior credit facilities. Under the amended
and restated facility, the term loan facility increased to $1,759
million (including €275 million). In addition, there is a
new $242 million delayed draw facility which when drawn will be added
to the existing term loan facility. The Company expects to use this
delayed draw facility to finance the acquisition of Acetex.

Also
in January 2005, the revolving credit facility was increased from $380
million to $600 million under the amended and restated senior credit
facilities. The $228 million credit-linked revolving facility, which
matures in 2009, includes borrowing capacity available for letters of
credit. As of December 31, 2004, there were $207 million of letters of
credit issued under the credit-linked revolving facility. As of
December 31, 2004, $401 million remained available for borrowing under
the revolving credit facilities (taking into account letters of credit
issued under the revolving credit facilities).

Substantially all
of the assets of Celanese Holdings LLC ("Celanese
Holdings"), the direct parent of BCP Crystal US Holdings
Corp. ("BCP Crystal"), and, subject to
certain exceptions, substantially all of its existing and future U.S.
subsidiaries, referred to as U.S. Guarantors, secure these facilities.
The borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a
rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrower's
option, either a base rate or a LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for
borrowing under the base rate option is 1.50% and for the LIBOR
option, 2.50% (in each case, subject to a step-down based on a
performance test).

The senior credit facilities are subject to
prepayment requirements and contain covenants, defaults and other
provisions. The senior credit facilities require BCP Crystal to prepay
outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:

– 75% (such percentage will be reduced to 50% if
BCP Crystal's leverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any
fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2005) of BCP
Crystal's excess cash flow;

– 100% of the net
cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and
condemnation events, unless BCP Crystal reinvests or contracts to
reinvest those proceeds in assets to be used in BCP Crystal's
business or to make certain other permitted investments within 12
months, subject to certain limitations;

– 100% of
the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt other than debt
permitted under the senior credit facilities, subject to certain
exceptions; and

– 50% of the net cash proceeds of
issuances of equity of Celanese Holdings, subject to certain
exceptions.

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

BCP Crystal may voluntarily repay
outstanding loans under the senior credit facility at any time without
premium or penalty, other than customary
"breakage" costs with respect to LIBOR
loans.

In connection with the borrowing by BCP Crystal under the
term loan portion of the senior credit facilities, BCP Crystal and CAC
have entered into an intercompany loan agreement whereby BCP Crystal
has agreed to lend the proceeds from any borrowings under its term loan
facility to CAC. The intercompany loan agreement contains the same
amortization provisions as the senior credit facilities. The interest
rate with respect to the loans made under the intercompany loan
agreement is the same as the interest rate with respect to the loans
under BCP Crystal's term loan facility plus three basis points.
BCP Crystal intends to service the indebtedness under its term loan
facility with the proceeds of payments made to it by CAC under the
intercompany loan agreement. This loan and related interest eliminate
in consolidation.

Floating Rate Term Loan.

The $350
million floating rate term loan matures in 2011. The borrowings under
the floating rate term loan bear interest at a rate equal to an
applicable margin plus, at BCP Crystal's option, either a base
rate or a LIBOR rate. Prior to the completion of the Restructuring, the
applicable margin for borrowings under the base rate option was
3.25% and for the LIBOR option, 4.25%. Subsequent to the
completion of the Restructuring, the applicable margin for borrowings
under the base rate option is 2.50% and for the LIBOR option,
3.50%. The floating rate term loan accrues interest. We used a
portion of new borrowings under the amended and restated senior credit
facilities to repay the floating rate term loan and $3 million of
associated premium in January 2005.

Senior Subordinated
Notes.

The senior subordinated notes consist of $1,225 million
of 9 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and
€200 million of 10 3/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2014. From the completion of the Restructuring,
all of BCP Crystal's U.S. domestic, wholly owned subsidiaries
that guarantee BCP Crystal's obligations under the senior credit
facilities guarantee the senior subordinated notes on an unsecured
senior subordinated basis. In February 2005, approximately $521 million
of the net proceeds of the offering of our Series A common stock was
used to redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and $51
million to pay the premium associated with the
redemption.

Senior Discount Notes.

In September 2004,
Crystal LLC and Crystal US Sub 3 Corp., a subsidiary of Crystal LLC,
issued $853 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of their
senior discount notes due 2014 consisting of $163 million principal
amount at maturity of their 10% Series A senior discount notes
due 2014 and $690 million principal amount at maturity of their
10½% Series B Senior Discount Notes due 2014
(collectively, the "senior discount notes").
The gross proceeds of the offering were $513 million. Approximately
$500 million of the proceeds were distributed to the Company's
Original Shareholders, with the remaining proceeds used to pay fees
associated with the refinancing. Until October 1, 2009, interest on the
senior discount notes will accrue in the form of an increase in the
accreted value of such notes. Cash interest on the senior discount
notes will accrue commencing on October 1, 2009 and be payable
semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1. In February 2005,
used approximately $37 million of the net proceeds of the offering of
our Series A common stock to redeem a portion of the Series A senior
discount notes and $151 million to redeem a portion of the Series B
senior discount notes and $19 million to pay the premium associated
with such redemption. Under the terms of the senior discount notes
registration statement, the Company is required to use its reasonable
best efforts to file a registration statement with the SEC relative to
offers to exchange the outstanding notes for exchange notes and
thereafter cause the registration statement to become effective not
later than 270 days following the closing date of the first issuance of
the outstanding notes or the interest rate on the outstanding notes
will be increased. The Company expects to meet this requirement within
the period specified.

Covenants.

The indentures
governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes
limit the ability of the issuers of such notes and the ability of their
restricted subsidiaries to:

•

incur
additional indebtedness or issue preferred
stock;

•

Subject to certain exceptions, the

The senior credit facilities contain a number of
covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain

Benefit Obligations

Pension obligations

.    Pension obligations are
established for benefits payable in the form of retirement, disability
and surviving dependent pensions. The benefits offered vary according
to the legal, fiscal and economic conditions of each country. The
commitments result from participation in defined contribution and
defined benefit plans, primarily in the U.S. Benefits are dependent on
years of service and the employee's compensation. Supplemental
retirement benefits provided to certain employees are non-qualified for
U.S. tax purposes. Separate trusts have been established for some
non-qualified plans.

Defined benefit pension plans exist at
certain locations in North America and Europe. As of December 31, 2004,
the Company's U.S. qualified pension plan represented greater
than 85 percent and 80 percent of Celanese's pension plan assets
and liabilities, respectively. Effective January 1, 2001, for the U.S.
qualified pension plan, the Company began providing pension benefits
for certain new employees hired in the United States after December 31,
2000 based upon a new Cash Balance Plan formula. Independent trusts or
insurance companies administer the majority of these plans. Actuarial
valuations for these plans are prepared annually.

The Company
sponsors various defined contribution plans in Europe and North America
covering certain employees. Employees may contribute to these plans and
the Company will match these contributions in varying amounts.
Contributions to the defined contribution plans are based on specified
percentages of employee contributions and they aggregated $8 million
for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, $3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2004, $11 million in 2003 and $12 million in
2002.

In connection with the acquisition of CAG, the Purchaser
agreed to pre-fund $463 million of certain pension obligations. During
the nine months ended December 31, 2004, $409 million was pre-funded to
the Company's pension plans. The Company contributed an
additional $42 million to the non-qualified pension plan's rabbi
trusts in February 2005.

Other postretirement
obligations

.    Certain retired employees receive postretirement
medical benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which has the
right to modify or terminate these plans at any time. Company employees
in the U.S. who were 50 years of age as of January 1, 2001, are
eligible to receive postretirement medical benefits, both pre-65
coverage and continued secondary coverage at age 65, provided that upon
termination they are at least age 55 and have a minimum of 10 years of
service. On January 1, 2001, Celanese AG eliminated continued
postretirement medical coverage at age 65 for employees who were not 50
on January 1, 2001 or were hired on or after January 1, 2001. This
group of employees continues to be eligible for pre-65 postretirement
medical coverage provided that upon termination they are at least age
55 and have a minimum of 10 years of service. Generally, the cost for
coverage is shared between the Company and the employee, and is
determined based upon completed years of service.

In 2003, the U.S. postretirement medical
plan was amended to introduce defined dollar caps for pre-1993
retirees. The amendments included: pre-age 65 cap was set to $9,600 and
the post-age 65 cap was set to $3,000; the elimination of pre-1993
retiree contributions until the cap is reached; moving all retirees to
the managed choice program; and the introduction of relatively minor
changes to the retiree cost sharing in order to simplify
administration. These changes were approved in June 2003 and were
reflected with a remeasurement of the retiree medical plan resulting in
a reduction in the accumulated projected benefit obligation
("APBO") which was set up as a $67 million
negative prior service cost base as these changes become effective July
1, 2004.

In December 2003, the Medicare Act established a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare known as
"Medicare Part D." As a result of this new
federally funded benefit, the Company expects a reduction to the
post-65 medical per capita claims cost in its postretirement plan.
Accordingly, the Company treated the resulting $6 million reduction in
APBO at July 1, 2004 as an actuarial gain. The introduction of the
federal benefit reduced the Company's SFAS No. 106 net periodic
benefit cost for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004 by less than
$1 million, due to lower service cost and interest, as well as
amortization of the unrecognized net gain.

The
projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value of plan assets for all defined benefit pension plans with
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at the end of
2004 and 2003 were as
follows:

The accumulated
benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2,964
million and $2,670 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
respectively.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31
for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

In 2003,
Celanese AG changed the actuarial valuation measurement date for its
Canadian pension and other postretirement benefit plans from September
30 to December 31. The net effect of this change is not material.

In 2002, Celanese AG changed the actuarial valuation measurement
date for its U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans from
September 30 to December 31. Celanese AG believed this method was
preferable because a calendar year reporting brought the valuation date
in line with its fiscal year-end reporting allowing for a more current
measurement of the related actuarial components. Celanese AG accounted
for this as a change in accounting principle, which resulted in a
cumulative effect adjustment in 2002. As a result, income of $9
million, net of income taxes of $5 million, was recorded to cumulative
effect of changes in accounting principles in the consolidated
statement of operations. In addition, this change reduced total 2002
pension and postretirement benefit expense cost by approximately $14
million.

and 2002, respectively. To fund these obligations, non-qualified trusts
were established, included within other non-current assets, which had
market values of $127 million and $130 million at December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, respectively, and recognized income (loss) of $6
million, $(1) million and $3 million for the nine months ended December
31, 2004, the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the year ended
December 31, 2003, respectively. There was no income recorded in 2002
related to these trusts. In 2003, the Predecessor contributed $18
million to these trusts from proceeds received from the demutualization
of an insurance company. The gain associated with these proceeds was
included within interest and other income, net, in the consolidated
statement of operations.

The asset allocation for the qualified
U.S. defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,

The
Company's other post-retirement benefit plans are unfunded.

The financial objectives of the qualified U.S. and Canadian pension
plans are established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of
each plan's liability structure. Asset allocation policy is based
on detailed asset/liability analysis. In developing investment policy
and financial goals, consideration is given to the plan's
demographics, the returns and risks associated with alternative
investment strategies, and the current and projected cash, expense and
funding ratios of the plan. A formal asset/liability mix study of the
plan is undertaken every 3 to 5 years or whenever there has been a
material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or funding
status and investment market. The Company has adopted a long-term
investment horizon such that the risk and duration of investment losses
are weighed against the long-term potential for appreciation of assets.
Although there cannot be complete assurance that these objectives will
be realized, it is believed that the likelihood for their realization
is reasonably high, based upon the asset allocation chosen and the
historical and expected performance of the asset classes utilized by
the plans. The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified
across asset classes, investment styles, investment managers, developed
and emerging markets, business sectors and securities in order to
moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments may be in separate
accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and other pooled asset
portfolios provided they all conform to fiduciary standards.

External investment managers are hired to manage the pension assets.
An investment consultant assists with the screening process for each
new manager hired. Over the long-term, the investment portfolio is
expected to earn returns that exceed a composite of market indices that
are weighted to match each plan's target asset allocation.
Long-term is considered three (3) to five (5) years; however,
incidences of underperformance are analyzed. The portfolio return
should also (over the long-term) meet or exceed the return used for
actuarial calculations in order to minimize future pension
contributions and escalation in pension expense.

The expected
rate of return assumptions for plan assets are based mainly on
historical performance achieved over a long period of time (15 to 20
years) encompassing many business and economic cycles. Adjustments,
upward and downward, may be made to those historical returns to reflect
future capital market expectations; these expectations are typically
derived from expert advice from the investment community and surveys of
peer company assumptions.

As a result of the $105 million
contribution made to the German plans for the year ended December 31,
2004, the four largest German plans, for the first time, have pension
plan assets. The asset allocation for the German defined benefit
pension plans as of December 31, 2004, and the target allocation ranges
for 2005 by asset category are presented below. The fair value of plan
assets for these plans was $118 million as of December 31, 2004. These
asset amounts represent approximately 5% of the Company's
total pension assets at December 31, 2004. The expected long-term rate
of return on these assets was 5.25% at December 31,
2004.

Plan
assets did not include any investment in Celanese AG or the
Company's common shares during the periods presented.

External investment managers have been hired to manage the German
pension assets. For the equity securities portion, the goal is to
approximate the development of the Euro Stoxx 50 Total Return
performance using a passive equity mandate. For the debt security
portion, a benchmark oriented active fixed income mandate that is
oriented towards the Lehman Euro Aggregate Bond Index is used.

To limit the market price risk of the invested funds it was decided
to invest the majority of the funds into fixed income instruments. The
remaining portion of the funds were invested into equity instruments to
benefit from a potentially higher equity performance compared with the
current performance of fixed income instruments.

Beginning
October 1, 2004, two different fund managers, one for equity and one
for fixed income, began investing in the equity and fixed income fund.
By the end of October 2004 both funds were completely invested.
Moderate lower interest rates as well as rising equity markets provided
a positive performance in the fourth quarter of 2004 for both
funds.

The funds are designated and managed in a way that the
assets invested provide a Euro based performance to meet the pension
requirements of German entities which are predominantly in Euro. This
ensures that additional risks from currency fluctuations are kept at a
low level.

The expected rate of return assumptions for plan
assets are based mainly on historical performance achieved over a long
period of time (15 to 20 years) encompassing many business and economic
cycles. Adjustments, upward and downward, may be made to those
historical returns to reflect future capital market expectations; these
expectations are typically derived from expert advice from the
investment community and surveys of peer company assumptions.

The table below reflects the pension benefits expected to be paid
from the plan or from the Company's assets. The postretirement
benefits represent both the Company's share of the benefit cost
and the participants' share of the cost, which is funded by
participant contributions to the plan. Expected contributions reflect
amounts expected to be contributed to funded
plans.

Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Stock

In April  2004, the
Company issued 200,000 shares of Series  A Cumulative
Exchangeable Preferred Shares due 2016 for gross proceeds of
$200  million, exclusive of $18  million of fees. These
non-voting preferred shares had an initial liquidation preference of
$1,000 per share and a dividend rate of 13%. As these preferred
shares were mandatorily redeemable, they were recorded as a liability
on the consolidated balance sheet, and the Company recorded associated
interest expense of $6  million for the nine months ended
December  31, 2004. These preferred shares were redeemed on
July  1, 2004 for $227  million, which included $6
million in accrued interest and a redemption premium of $21
million. Accordingly, the Company expensed $18  million of
unamortized deferred financing costs and the redemption premium of
$21  million, both of which are included within interest expense
in the nine months ended December  31, 2004.

Environmental

General

– The
Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations worldwide
which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air
and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that it is
in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and
regulations. The Company is also subject to retained environmental
obligations specified in various contractual agreements arising from
divestiture of certain businesses by the Company or one of its
predecessor companies.

For the nine months ended December 31,
2004, the Successor's worldwide expenditures, including
expenditures for legal compliance, internal environmental initiatives
and remediation of active, orphan, divested and U.S. Superfund sites
were $66 million. The Predecessor's worldwide expenditures for
the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 were $22 million, $80 million and $83 million,
respectively. The Successor's capital project related
environmental expenditures for the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
and the Predecessor's for the three months ended March 31, 2004
and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, included in worldwide
expenditures, were $6 million, $2 million, $10 million and $4 million,
respectively. Environmental reserves for remediation matters were $143
million and $159 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As of December 31, 2004, the estimated range for
remediation costs is between $100 million and $143 million, with the
best estimate being $143 million.

Remediation

– Due to its
industrial history and through retained contractual and legal
obligations, the Company has the obligation to remediate specific areas
on its own sites as well as on divested, orphan or U.S. Superfund
sites. In addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the
Predecessor and Hoechst, a specified portion of the responsibility for
environmental liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was
transferred to the Predecessor. The Company provides for such
obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably
estimable.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the
three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, the total remediation efforts charged to earnings before tax
were $3 million, $0 million, $0 million and $7 million, respectively.
These charges were offset by reversals of previously established
environmental reserves due to favorable trends in estimates at
unrelated sites of $2 million, $2 million, $6 million and $15 million
during the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the three months ended
March 31, 2004, and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Management believes that environmental remediation costs
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of
the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations or cash flows in any given accounting period.

The
Company did not record any insurance recoveries related to these
matters for the reported periods. There are no receivables for
recoveries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

German
InfraServs

– On January 1, 1997, coinciding with a
reorganization of the Hoechst businesses in Germany, real estate
service companies ("InfraServs") were created
to own directly the land and property and to provide various technical
and administrative services at each of the manufacturing locations. The
Company has manufacturing operations at three InfraServ locations in
Germany: Oberhausen, Frankfurt am Main-Hoechst and Kelsterbach, and
holds interests in the companies which own and operate the former
Hoechst sites in Gendorf, Knapsack and Wiesbaden.

InfraServs are
liable for any residual contamination and other pollution because they
own the real estate on which the individual facilities operate. In
addition, Hoechst, as the responsible party under German public law, is
liable to third parties for all environmental damage that occurred
while it was still the owner of the plants and real estate. The
contribution agreements entered into in 1997 between Hoechst and the
respective operating companies, as part of the divestiture of these
companies, provide that the operating companies will indemnify Hoechst
against environmental liabilities resulting from the transferred
businesses. Additionally, the InfraServs have agreed to indemnify
Hoechst against any environmental liability arising out of or in
connection with environmental pollution of any site. Likewise, in
certain circumstances the Company could be responsible for the
elimination of residual contamination on a few sites that were not
transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst must
reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between the
partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination caused
predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which cannot be
attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no third party is
responsible, is required to be borne by the InfraServ Partnership. In
view of this potential obligation to eliminate residual contamination,
the InfraServs, primarily relating to equity and cost affiliates which
are not consolidated by the Company, have reserves of $81 million and
$72 million as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
respectively.

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective
indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination, the
owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ companies have
agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a number of limitations. To
the extent that any liabilities are not satisfied by either the
InfraServs or their owners, these liabilities are to be borne by the
Company in accordance with the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst
will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any such costs. Likewise,
in certain circumstances the Company could be responsible for the
elimination of residual contamination on several sites that were not
transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst must also
reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred. The
German InfraServs are owned partially by the Company, as noted below,
and the remaining ownership is held by various other

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

companies. The Company's ownership
interest and environmental liability participation percentages for such
liabilities which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner were as
follows as of December 31,
2004:

U.S.
Superfund Sites

– In the U.S., the Company may be subject to
substantial claims brought by U.S. Federal or state regulatory agencies
or private individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law.
In particular, the Company has a potential liability under the U.S.
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws (collectively
referred to as "Superfund") for investigation
and cleanup costs at approximately 50 sites. At most of these sites,
numerous companies, including certain companies comprising the Company,
or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the
Environmental Protection Agency, state governing bodies or private
individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible
parties ("PRP") under Superfund or related
laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages.
The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites and the status
of the insurance coverage for most of these proceedings is uncertain.
Consequently, the Company cannot determine accurately its ultimate
liability for investigation or cleanup costs at these sites. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Successor and the Predecessor had
provisions totaling $14 million and $12 million, respectively, for U.S.
Superfund sites and utilized $2 million, less than $1 million, $1
million and $1 million of these reserves during the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. There were no significant additional
provisions recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the
three months ended March 31, 2004, and the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002.

As events progress at each site for which it has
been named a PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for
site cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable and
can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these liabilities, the
Company considers its shipment of waste to a site, its percentage of
total waste shipped to the site, the types of wastes involved, the
conclusions of any studies, the magnitude of any remedial actions that
may be necessary and the number and viability of other PRPs. Often the
Company will join with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that
will settle, among PRPs, each party's percentage allocation of
costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ from the
estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities and revises the
estimate, as appropriate, based on the most current information
available.

Hoechst Liabilities –

In connection with
the Hoechst demerger, Celanese AG agreed to indemnify Hoechst for the
first €250 million (approximately $340 million) of future
remediation liabilities for environmental damages arising from 19
specified divested Hoechst entities. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
reserves of $46 million and $53 million, respectively, for these
matters are included as a component of the total environmental
reserves. Celanese AG and its legal successors, have made total
payments through the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $38
million and $35 million, respectively. If such future liabilities
exceed €250 million (approximately $340 million), Hoechst
will bear such excess up to an additional €500 million
(approximately $680 million). Thereafter, the Company will bear
one-third and Hoechst will bear two-thirds of any further environmental
remediation liabilities. Where the Company is unable to reasonably
determine the probability of loss or estimate such loss under this
indemnification, the Company has not recognized any liabilities
relative to this indemnification.

industry. During 2003, the Predecessor recorded a $44 million increase
to additional paid-in capital related to recoveries due from Hoechst
for the antitrust matters in the sorbates industry (See Note 27).
During 2002, the Predecessor recorded a $7 million increase to

During 2003 and 2002, the
Predecessor granted stock options totaling 0.1 million and 1.1 million,
respectively, and, in accordance with SFAS No. 123, expensed the fair
value of these options. As a result, additional paid-in capital
increased by $1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2004,

and unrealized gains/losses on derivative contracts.

The
after-tax components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
are as

Dividends

Successor

In September 2004, the Company issued senior
discount notes for gross proceeds of $513 million and distributed $500
million of the proceeds to the Original Stockholder in the form of a

the Series B common stock shareholders, which is expected to be paid on
April 7, 2005. The dividends will substantially reduce the equity
received from the initial public offering (See Note 3). Upon payment of
the $804 million dividend, the shares of the Series B common stock
convert automatically to shares of Series A common stock.

Special Charges

Special charges include provisions for restructuring and other
expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of
operations. Restructuring provisions represent costs related to
severance and other benefit programs related to major activities
undertaken to fundamentally redesign the business operations, as well
as costs incurred in connection with decisions to exit non-strategic
businesses. These measures are based on formal management decisions,
establishment of agreements with employees' representatives or
individual agreements with affected employees, as well as the public
announcement of the restructuring plan. The related reserves reflect
certain estimates, including those pertaining to separation costs,
settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs. The
Company reassesses the reserve requirements to complete each individual
plan under existing restructuring programs at the end of each reporting
period. Actual experience may be different from these estimates.

The components of special charges for the nine months ended December

Successor

Included in the above restructuring reserve of $86 million at
December 31, 2004 are $18 million of long-term reserves included in
Other liabilities.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
the Successor recorded expense of $91 million in special charges, which
consisted of $60 million of restructuring charges and $34 million from
other special charges. The $60 million of additions to the
restructuring reserve included employee severance costs of $8 million
and plant and office closure costs of $52 million. Within other special
charges there were $34 million of expenses, of which $32 million
related to a non-cash impairment charge based on the Company's
decision to sell its COC business within the Ticona Technical Polymers
segment, and $2 million related to an asset impairment of a chemical
unit in Canada.

In October 2004, the Company announced plans to
consolidate its tow production to fewer sites by 2007 and to
discontinue the production of acetate filament by mid-2005. In the
third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges of
$50 million related to asset impairment of the Company's acetate
business. The restructuring is being implemented to increase
efficiency, reduce overcapacity and to focus on products and markets
that provide long-term value.

During the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, the Company continued with its redesign initiatives.
The Chemical Products segment recorded approximately $4 million of
severance and organizational redesign costs, which included
approximately $2 million related to the shutdown of an obsolete
synthesis gas unit in Germany. Ticona recorded approximately $6 million
similarly for severance, relocation and employee related expenses,
primarily associated with management's initiative to relocate the
segment's administrative and research and development functions
from Summit, New Jersey to Florence, Kentucky.

In connection with the Acquisition, at
the Acquisition Date, the Company began formulating a plan to exit or
restructure certain activities. The Company has not completed this
analysis, but has recorded initial purchase accounting liabilities of
$60 million, $51 million of which is included in the table above, with
the remaining $9 million recorded in other current liabilities. These
liabilities are primarily for employee severance and related costs in
connection with the preliminary plan as well as approving the
continuation of all existing Predecessor restructuring and exit plans.
As the Company finalizes its plans to exit or restructure activities,
it may record additional liabilities, for among other things, severance
and severance related costs and such amounts could be significant.

Predecessor

Included in the above restructuring reserve of
$49 million as of December 31, 2003, is $9 million of long-term
reserves included in other liabilities.

For the three months
ended March 31, 2004, the Predecessor recorded $28 million in special
charges, comprised primarily of expenses for advisory services related
to the Acquisition.

In 2003, the Predecessor recorded expense of
$5 million in special charges, which consisted of $25 million of
restructuring charges, $6 million of income from favorable adjustments
to restructuring reserves that were recorded previously and $14 million
of income from other special charges. The $25 million of additions to
the restructuring reserve included employee severance costs of $18
million and plant and office closure costs of $7 million. Within other
special charges there was income of $107 million related to insurance
recoveries associated with the plumbing cases, partially offset by $95
million of expenses for antitrust matters in the sorbates industry,
primarily related to a decision by the European Commission.

In
2003, the Chemical Products segment recorded employee severance charges
of $4 million, which primarily related to the shutdown of an obsolete
synthesis gas unit in Germany.

In 2003, Ticona commenced the
redesign of its operations. These plans included a decision to sell the
Summit, New Jersey site and to relocate administrative and research and
development activities to the existing Ticona site in Florence,
Kentucky in 2004. As a result of this decision, the Predecessor
recorded termination benefit expense of $5 million in 2003. In addition
to the relocation in the United States, Ticona has streamlined its
operations in Germany, primarily through offering employees early
retirement benefits under an existing employee benefit arrangement. As
a result of this arrangement, Ticona recorded a charge of $7 million in
2003.

Also in 2003, based on a 2002 restructuring initiative to
concentrate its European manufacturing operations in Germany, Ticona
ceased its manufacturing operations in Telford, United Kingdom. This
resulted in contract termination costs and asset impairments totaling
$7 million and employee severance costs of $1 million in 2003. Through
December 31, 2003, the total costs of the Telford shutdown through 2003
were $12 million.

The $6 million of income from favorable
adjustments of previously recorded restructuring reserves consisted of
a $1 million adjustment to the 2002 reserves, a $4 million adjustment
to the 2001 reserves and a $1 million adjustment to the 1999 reserves.
The adjustment to the 2002 reserve related to lower than expected costs
related to the demolition of the GUR Bayport facility. The adjustment
to the 2001 reserve was primarily due to the lower than expected
decommissioning costs of the Mexican production facility. The
adjustment to the 1999 reserve was due to lower than expected payments
related to the closure of a former administrative facility in the
United States.

In 2002, the Predecessor recorded income from
special charges of $5 million, which consisted of $14 million of
restructuring charges, $10 million of income from favorable adjustments
to previously recorded restructuring reserves, $1 million of income
from reimbursements from third party site partners related to prior
year initiatives, and $8 million of income from other special charges.
The $14 million of restructuring charges included employee severance
costs of $8 million and plant and office closure costs of $6
million.

Project Focus, initiated in early 2001,
set goals to reduce trade working capital, limit capital expenditures
and improve earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and

announced in August 2001 and initiated additional restructuring and
other measures to reduce costs and increase profitability. During 2002,
the Predecessor recorded employee severance charges of $8 million, of
which $3 million related to adjustments to the 2001 forward initiatives
and $4 million for streamlining efforts of production facilities in
Germany and the United States, and $1 million for employee severance
costs in the polyvinyl alcohol business.

Ticona recorded asset

shutdown operations in Telford, United Kingdom in 2003. In addition,
with the construction of a new and expanded GUR plant in Bishop, Texas,
the GUR operations in Bayport, Texas were transferred to a new
facility. Decommissioning and demolition costs associated with the
Bayport closure were $2 million.

The $10 million of favorable
adjustments of previously recorded restructuring reserves consisted of
an $8 million adjustment to the 2001 reserves and a $2 million
adjustment to the 2000 reserves. The 2001 adjustment was primarily due
to lower than expected personnel and closure costs associated with the
streamlining of chemical facilities in the United States, Canada, and
Germany. The 2000 adjustment was due to lower than expected demolition
costs for the Chemical Products production facility in Knapsack,
Germany. The other special charges income of $8 million related to a
reduction in reserves associated with settlements of environmental
indemnification obligations associated with former Hoechst
entities.

Income Taxes

As of the
period ended December 31, 2004, the Company is headquartered in the
U.S. Under federal U.S. tax law, U.S. corporations are subject to a
35% federal corporate income tax. In addition, U.S. corporations
are generally subject to state income taxes at various rates based on
location. The estimated average state income tax rate, after federal
benefit, is approximately 2%.

For the three months ended
March 31, 2004, and for the years ended 2003 and 2002, the Predecessor
was headquartered in Germany. Under German tax law, German corporations
are subject to both a corporate income tax and a trade income tax, the
latter of which varies based upon location. The German corporate income
tax rate in 2003 was 26.5%. Combined with a solidarity surcharge
of 5.5% on the corporate tax, and the blended trade income tax
rate after corporate tax benefit, the statutory tax rate in Germany was
41 percent. In 2002 and for the three months ended March 31, 2004, the
corporate rate was 25%. Combined with a solidarity surcharge of
5.5% on the corporate tax, and the blended trade income tax rate
after corporate tax benefit, the statutory tax rate in Germany was
40%.

Deferred taxes are being provided at a 37%
percent rate for the U.S. companies as of December 31, 2004. Deferred
taxes are being provided on all other companies at the tax rate that
will be in effect in the local tax jurisdictions at the time the
temporary differences are expected to reverse.

2004, and as compared to the statutory rate,
the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected primarily by the
application of full valuation allowances against post-acquisition net
U.S. deferred tax assets, Canadian deferred tax assets due to
post-acquisition restructuring and certain German deferred tax assets.
A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
a deferred tax asset, all or in part, will not be realized. The
effective rate was also unfavorably affected by the non-recognition of
tax benefits associated with acquisition related expenses. The
unfavorable effects were partially offset by unrepatriated low taxed
earnings, primarily in Singapore. In the nine months ended December 31,
2004, the Company finalized certain tax audits related to the
pre-acquisition period which resulted in a reduction to income taxes
payable of approximately $113 million with a corresponding reduction to
goodwill.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 was based on a 24% annualized effective rate
which was primarily attributable to projected unrepatriated low taxed
earnings in Singapore.

In comparison to the German statutory tax
rate, the 2003 effective rate was favorably affected by unrepatriated
low-taxed earnings, favorable settlement of prior year (1996) taxes in
the U.S., equity earnings from Polyplastics Co. Ltd. which are excluded
from U.S. taxable income and utilization of a U.S. capital loss
carryforward that had been subject to a valuation allowance. The
effective tax rate was unfavorably affected in 2003 by dividend
distributions from subsidiaries and writedowns of certain German
corporate income and trade tax benefits related to prior years.

In comparison to the German statutory tax rate, the
effective tax rate in 2002 was favorably affected by the utilization of
certain net operating loss carryforwards in Germany, the release of
certain valuation allowances on prior years' deferred tax assets,
unrepatriated low-taxed earnings and a lower effective minimum tax
burden in Mexico. The effective tax rate was unfavorably affected in
2002 by distributions of taxable dividends from equity investments and
the reversal of a tax-deductible writedown in 2000 of a German
investment.

The tax effects of the temporary differences
which give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as
follows:

(1)

Includes
deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustments of approximately
$390 million which were recorded to Goodwill. These account for the
primary differences with respect to items which are not reflected in
the effective tax rate reconciliation.

The Company has
established valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets in the
U.S., Mexico and certain Canadian and German entities. These valuation
allowances relate to net operating loss carryforward benefits and other
net deferred tax assets, all of which may not be realizable.

At December 31, 2004, the Company has net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $300 million for Germany
and Mexico, with various expiration dates. The U.S. federal net
operating loss carryforwards are approximately $490 million for the
pre-acquisition period and are subject to significant limitation. The
acquisition and corresponding tax law governing the utilization of
acquired net operating losses triggered this limitation. The associated
deferred tax asset was $172 million at the acquisition date. Except for
an estimated $19 million, potentially realizable as a result of the
annual limitation effect and utilizable against future U.S. taxable
income (which has been subject to a full valuation allowance), the
remaining tax benefit for the pre-acquisition U.S. net operating loss
carryforward has been written off.

Post-acquisition U.S. federal
net operating loss carryforwards are approximately $280 million and
will expire in 2024. Post acquisition foreign net operating loss
carryforwards are approximately $80 million and will expire at various
dates.

The other U.S. net deferred tax assets as of March 31,
2004 was $351 million. As a result of the acquisition, a full valuation
allowance was applied against these net assets with a corresponding
increase in Goodwill. A subsequent recognition of any tax benefit
related to these temporary differences and/or certain pre-acquisition
net operating losses will be a decrease to Goodwill.

The Company
had U.S. capital loss carryforwards of $104 million, which expired in
October 2004 and accordingly are not reflected in the 2004 deferred tax
assets and valuation allowance amounts above.

Provisions have
not been made for income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on
cumulative earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $83
million because such earnings will either not be subject to any such
taxes or are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in those
operations. In addition, the Company has not provided taxes on
approximately $480 million of temporary differences attributable to
investments in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures
because such differences are essentially permanent in duration. It is
not practical to determine the tax liability, if any, that would be
payable if such amounts were not reinvested indefinitely or were not
permanent in duration.

The Act provides for a one-time tax
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated. This provision is applicable to the last tax year that
began before the enactment date, or that begins in the one-year period
beginning on the enactment date. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision, and as a result,
the tax impact for the year ending December 31, 2004 is zero. The
evaluation process will be completed by the fourth quarter 2005 with a
potential range of earnings to be repatriated under this provision of
zero to $200 million. The related range of income tax effects of such
repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

The
income tax (benefit) expense for the nine months ended December 31,
2004, the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 was allocated to continuing operations and
accumulated other comprehensive income. The aggregate tax expense
(benefit) amounts allocated to accumulated other comprehensive income,
for unrealized gains (losses) on securities, additional minimum pension
liabilities and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative contracts was
$(2) million, $2 million, $11 million and ($121 million) for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, the three months ended March 31, 2004
and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
income tax (benefit) expense associated with other comprehensive income
is dependent upon the tax jurisdiction in which the items arise and
accordingly could result in an effective tax rate that is different
from the overall consolidated effective income tax rate on the
statement of operations.

Stock-based and Other
Management Compensation Plans

In December
2004, the Company approved a stock incentive plan for executive
officers, key employees and directors, a deferred compensation plan for
executive officers and key employees as well as other management
incentive programs.

The Company's stock incentive
plan allows for the issuance or delivery of up to 16.25  million
shares of the Company's Series  A common stock through
stock options and a discounted share program. In

F-63

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

January 2005, options were initially granted
at an exercise price equal to the initial public offering price. The
options have a ten-year term with vesting terms pursuant to a schedule,
with no vesting to occur later than the 8th anniversary of the date of
the grant. Accelerated vesting depends on meeting specified performance
targets.

In December 2004, the Company granted rights to
executive officers, key employees and directors to purchase up to
1,797,386 shares of Series A common stock at a discount of $8.80 per
share. As a result of this discounted share offering, the Company
recorded a one-time pre-tax non-cash charge of $14 million, with a
corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital within
shareholders' equity (deficit).

The deferred
compensation plan has an aggregate maximum amount payable of
$192  million. The initial component of the deferred compensation
plan, totaling an aggregate of approximately $27  million, vested
in 2004 and was paid in the first quarter of 2005. The remaining
aggregate maximum amount payable of $165  million is subject to
downward adjustment if the price of the Company's common stock
falls below the initial public offering price and vests subject to both
(1)  continued employment or the achievement of the certain
performance criteria and (2)  the disposition by Blackstone of at
least 90% of its equity interest in the Company with at least a
25% cash internal rate of return on their equity interest.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded
compensation expense of $27 million associated with this plan.

At the Annual General Meetings of Celanese AG on May 15, 2002 and
April 1, 2003, shareholders approved the 2002 Celanese Stock Option
Plan (the "2002 Plan") and the 2003 Celanese
Stock Option Plan (the "2003 Plan"),
respectively. Each plan authorized the issuance of up to 1.25 million
options to purchase shares of Celanese AG common stock. Options are
granted at an exercise price reflecting the reference price (twenty day
average of market price prior to grant date) plus a 20% exercise
premium and become exercisable five years from the date of grant. Two
year vesting is possible, if the market price per share outperforms the
median performance of Celanese competitors as defined in the plan over
the holding period. All unexercised options expire ten years from the
date of grant. If the market price per Celanese AG share of common
stock on the date of exercise is at least 20% higher than the
reference price at the time of the grant, the holder is entitled to
receive a cash payment equal to the exercise premium of 20%.

On July 8, 2002, the Predecessor granted 1.1 million stock options
relating to the 2002 Plan, at an exercise price of €27.54
per share, to members of the Board of Management and key employees for
the purchase of Celanese AG shares of common stock. On January 31,
2003, the Predecessor granted an additional 0.1 million stock options
relating to the 2002 plan, at an exercise price of €23.78
per share, to individuals who became eligible persons since the last
grant for the purchase of Celanese AG shares of common stock.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the fair value of the 1.1 million and 0.1
million options granted approximated €10 million ($10
million) and €1 million ($1 million), respectively. As a
result of Celanese AG's market price per share outperforming the
median performance of Celanese AG's peer group, the fair value of
these options was recognized over the accelerated vesting period of two
years. For the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Predecessor recognized compensation
expense of $2 million, $6 million and $3 million, respectively, for
these options to the Consolidated Statements of Operations with a
corresponding increase to additional paid in capital within
shareholders' equity (deficit).

ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was estimated to be
€6.41($6.93) per option and €9.33 ($9.10) per
option, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following
assumptions:

Effective
January 15, 2001, the Predecessor adopted the Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the "2000 Celanese AG LTIP"). The 2000
Celanese AG LTIP covers the Board of Management and senior executives
of the Predecessor. Stock appreciation rights
("Rights") granted under the 2000 Celanese AG
LTIP have a ten-year term and generally will be exercisable in whole or
in part, subject to certain limitations, at any time during the period
between January 15, 2003 and January 14, 2011, provided at the time of
exercise, the performance of an ordinary share of Celanese AG on the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange must exceed the performance of the median of
the share prices of Celanese AG's peer group companies as defined
by the Board of Management of Celanese AG. Under the 2000 Celanese AG
LTIP, the participant will receive the cash difference between the base
price and the share price of Celanese AG on the day of exercise. Of the
total Rights granted under this plan, approximately 8,500 remain
outstanding as of December 31, 2004. The Predecessor recognized expense
of less than $1 million, $24 million and $1 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2004, and the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, for the 2000 Celanese AG LTIP. Rights remaining
unexercised as of January 15, 2011 will be deemed to have been
forfeited as of that date. The grant price of these Rights was
€19.56 per share.

During 1999, the Predecessor
adopted the Equity Participation Plan (the "1999 Celanese
AG EPP") and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
"1999 Celanese AG LTIP"). The 1999 Celanese
AG EPP covers the Board of Management and certain senior executives of
the Predecessor. The participants in the 1999 Celanese EPP were
required to purchase a defined value of Celanese AG stock over a one or
two year period. The Rights granted under the 1999 Celanese AG EPP were
based on the required amount of

money invested in Celanese AG shares by the
participant, divided by the base price of the stock and multiplied by
two. Rights granted under the EPP have a ten-year term and generally
will be exercisable in whole or in part, subject to certain
limitations, at any time during the period between October 25, 2001 and
October 25, 2009, provided at the time of exercise, the performance of
an ordinary share of Celanese AG on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange must
exceed the median of performance of the share prices of Celanese
AG's peer group companies as defined by the Celanese AG Board of
Management. Under the 1999 Celanese AG EPP, the participant will
receive the cash difference between the base price and the Celanese AG
share price on the day of exercise. Of the total Rights granted under
this plan, approximately 3,700 remain outstanding as of December 31,
2004. Rights remaining unexercised as of October 26, 2009 will be
deemed to have been forfeited as of that date. The grant price of these
Rights was €16.37 per share. The Predecessor recognized
expense of less than $1 million, $18 million and $1 million for the
1999 Celanese AG EPP for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The 1999
Celanese AG LTIP covers the Board of Management and senior executives
of Celanese. AG Rights granted under the 1999 Celanese AG LTIP have a
ten-year term and generally are exercisable in whole or in part,
subject to limitations, at any time during the period between October
25, 2001 and October 25, 2009, provided at the time of exercise, the
performance of an ordinary share of Celanese AG on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange must exceed the performance of the median of the share prices
of Celanese AG's peer group companies as defined by the Celanese
AG Board of Management. Under the 1999 Celanese AG LTIP, the
participant will receive the cash difference between the base price and
the share price of Celanese AG on the day of exercise. At December 31,
2004, approximately 8,650 of the total Rights granted under this plan
remained outstanding. Rights remaining unexercised as of October 26,
2009 will be deemed to have been forfeited as of that date. The grant
price of these Rights was €16.37 per share. The
Predecessor recognized expense of less than $1 million, $17 million and
$1 million for the 1999 Celanese AG LTIP for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

appreciation rights plans is presented in the table below (Rights in

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Beginning in 2000, the Predecessor
offered stock participation plans ("SPP") to
employees not eligible to participate in the stock appreciation rights
plans. Under these plans, active employees who invested a defined
amount of money in Celanese AG shares during a limited period of time
were entitled to receive a 35 percent rebate from the Company. The SPP
was not offered to employees during 2004 or 2003. Compensation expense
of $2 million was recognized in 2002 related to the SPP.

In
connection with its demerger from Hoechst, the Predecessor assumed
obligations associated with the Hoechst 1997 Stock Appreciation Rights
Plan (the "1997 Hoechst SAR Plan") and the
Hoechst 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "1998 Hoechst Option
Plan") for participating employees under these
compensation programs. As a result of the merger of Hoechst and
Rhône—Poulenc to form Aventis in December 1999, the terms
and conditions of these compensation programs were modified to take
into account the changed circumstances.

The 1997 Hoechst SAR
Plan and 1998 Hoechst Option Plan, including all rights and options
granted, expired in 2002 and 2003, respectively. There was no impact on
earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 or the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and less than $1 million of income for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for the 1998
Hoechst Option Plan. The Predecessor recognized $1 million of income in
2002 for the 1997 Hoechst SAR Plan.

Earnings (Loss) Per
Share

Prior
to the completion of the initial public offering of Celanese
Corporation Series A common stock in January 2005, the Company effected
a 152.772947  for  1 stock split of outstanding shares of
common stock (see Note  20). Accordingly, basic and diluted
shares for the nine months ended December  31, 2004 have been
calculated based on the weighted average shares outstanding, adjusted
for the stock split. Earnings (loss) per share for the Predecessor
periods has been calculated by dividing net income available to common
shareholders by the historical weighted average shares outstanding of
the Predecessor. As the capital structure of the Predecessor and
Successor are different, the reported earnings (loss) per share are not
comparable.

Shares issuable pursuant to outstanding common stock
options under the Predecessor's Stock Option Plans of 544,750
have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per
share for the nine months ended December  31, 2004 because their
effect is antidilutive.

The
related assets for capital leases are included in machinery and
equipment in the consolidated balance sheets.

Management expects
that, in the normal course of business, leases that expire will be

Financial
Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company
uses various financial instruments, including derivative financial
instruments, to manage risks associated with interest rate, currency,
certain raw material price and stock based compensation exposures. The
Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company may
enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of
interest rate risk inherent in the Company's outstanding debt by
locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired level of fixed/floating
rate debt depending on market conditions. At December 31, 2004, the
Successor had no interest rate swap agreements in place. The
Predecessor had open interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $200
million at December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of 2004, the
Successor recorded a loss of less than $1 million in other income
(expense), net, associated with the early termination of its $200
million interest rate swap. During 2003, the Predecessor recorded a
loss of $7 million in other income (expense), net, associated with the
early termination of one of its interest rate swaps. The Successor
recognized interest expense from hedging activities relating to
interest rate swaps of $1 million for the nine months ended December
31, 2004. The Predecessor recognized net interest expense from hedging
activities relating to interest rate swaps of $2 million, $11 million
and $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, the
Predecessor's interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow
hedges, resulted in a decrease in total assets and total liabilities
and an increase in shareholders' equity of $4 million, $14
million and $7 million, net of related income tax of $4 million,
respectively. The Predecessor recorded a net gain (loss) of less than
($1)

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

million, $2 million and ($3) million in other
income (expense), net of the ineffective portion of the interest rate
swaps, during the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Foreign Exchange Risk
Management

Certain entities have receivables and payables
denominated in currencies other than their respective functional
currencies, which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company may enter
into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize its exposure to
foreign currency fluctuations. The foreign currency contracts are
mainly for booked exposure and, in some cases, cash flow hedges for
anticipated exposure associated with sales from the Performance
Products segment.

On June  16, 2004, as part of its
currency risk management, the Company entered into a currency swap with
certain financial institutions. Under the terms of the swap
arrangement, the Company will pay approximately €13
million in interest and receive approximately $16  million in
interest on each June  15 and December  15 (with interest
for the first period prorated). Upon maturity of the swap agreement on
June  16, 2008, the Company will pay approximately
€276  million and receive approximately $333
million. The Company designated the swap, the euro term loan and a euro
note as a net investment hedge (for accounting purposes) in the fourth
quarter of 2004. The loss related to the swap was $21 million for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004, of which $14 million is related to
the ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge. During the nine months
ended December 31, 2004, the effects of the swap resulted in an
increase in total liabilities and a decrease in shareholders'
equity (deficit) of $57  million and $36  million,
respectively.

Contracts with notional amounts totaling
approximately $288 million and $765 million at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, are predominantly in U.S. dollars, British pound
sterling, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Most of the
Company's foreign currency forward contracts did not meet the
criteria of SFAS No. 133 to qualify for hedge accounting. The Company
recognizes net foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the
underlying transactions, which are offset by losses and gains related
to foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31,
2004, the Company's foreign currency forward contracts resulted
in a decrease in total assets and an increase in total liabilities of
$42 million and $2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004,
these contracts, in addition to natural hedges, hedged approximately
100% of the Company's net receivables held in currencies
other than the entities' functional currency for the
Company's European operations. Related to the unhedged portion
during the year, a net gain (loss) of approximately ($2) million and $4
million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other
income (expense), net for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and
the three months ended March 31, 2004, respectively. During 2003, the
Predecessor's foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a
decrease in total assets of $8 million and an increase in total
liabilities of $1 million. As of December 31, 2003, these contracts
hedged a portion (approximately 85%) of the Predecessor's
U.S. dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro
denominated entities. Related to the unhedged portion, a net loss of
approximately $14 million from foreign exchange gains or losses was
recorded to other income (expense), net in 2003. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Predecessor hedged all of its US. dollar
denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated
entities. Therefore, there was no material net effect from foreign
exchange gains or losses in interest. Hedging activities related to
intercompany net receivables yielded cash flows from operating
activities of approximately $24 million, less than $1 million, $180
million and $95 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There was no material impact
on the balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and 2003. There were no
unrealized gains and losses associated with the cash-settled swap
contracts as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Celanese did not have any
open commodity swaps as of December 31, 2004. The Predecessor had open
swaps with a notional amount of $5 million as of December 31, 2003.

Stock Based Compensation Risk Management

During 2001, the
Predecessor purchased call options for one million shares of Celanese
AG stock to offset, in part, its exposure of the 2000 Celanese LTIP.
These options had a maturity of two years, a strike price of
€19.56 per share and an average premium of
€4.39 per share. These options expired during 2003. As a
result, a net loss of $1 million was recorded to interest income in
2003.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Summarized
below are the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial
instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For these
purposes, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing
parties.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair values of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, notes payable, trade payables, short-term
debt and the current installments of long-term debt approximate
carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
These items have been excluded from the table. Additionally, certain
long-term receivables, principally insurance recoverables, are carried
at net realizable value (See Note 27).

Included in other assets
are certain investments accounted for under the cost method and
long-term marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. In
general, the cost investments are not publicly traded and their fair
values are not readily determinable; however, the Company believes that
the carrying value approximates or is less than the fair value.

The fair value of long-term debt and debt-related financial
instruments is estimated based upon the respective implied forward
rates as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, as well as quotations from
investment bankers and on current rates of debt for similar type
instruments.

27.

Commitments and
Contingencies

The Company is involved in a number of legal
proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of
its business, relating to such matters as product liability,
anti-trust, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into
the environment. While it is impossible at this time to determine

F-71

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

with certainty the ultimate outcome of these
proceedings, lawsuits and claims, management believes, based on the
advice of legal counsel, that adequate provisions have been made and
that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on
the financial position of the Company, but may have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given
accounting period.

Plumbing Actions

CNA Holdings, Inc.
("CNA Holdings"), a U.S. subsidiary of the
Company, included the U.S. business now conducted by the Ticona
segment. CNA Holdings, along with Shell Chemical Company
("Shell") and E. I. du Pont de Nemours
("DuPont"), among others, have been the
defendants in a series of lawsuits, alleging that plastics manufactured
by these companies that were utilized in the production of plumbing
systems for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing
systems to fail. Based on, among other things, the findings of outside
experts and the successful use of Ticona's acetal copolymer in
similar applications, CNA Holdings does not believe Ticona's
acetal copolymer was defective or caused the plumbing systems to fail.
In many cases, CNA Holdings' exposure may be limited by
invocation of the statute of limitations since CNA Holdings ceased
selling the resin for use in the plumbing systems in site built homes
during 1986 and in manufactured homes during 1990.

CNA Holdings
has been named a defendant in ten putative class actions, further
described below, as well as a defendant in other non-class actions
filed in ten states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. In these
actions, the plaintiffs typically have sought recovery for alleged
property damages and, in some cases, additional damages under the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices Act or similar type statutes. Damage amounts
have not been specified.

Developments under this matter are as
follows:

•

Class certification has been
denied in putative class actions pending in Florida state court.
Although plaintiffs subsequently sought to bring actions individually,
they were dismissed and subsequently their appeal was denied.

•

Class certification has been denied in a
putative class action pending in South Carolina state court. CNA
Holdings' motion to dismiss has been granted and
plaintiffs' appeals up to the U.S. Supreme Court have been
denied.

•

In April 2000, the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey denied class certification for a
putative class action (of insurance companies with respect to
subrogation claims). The plaintiffs' appeal to the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals was denied in July 2000 and the case was subsequently
dismissed. In September 2000, a similar putative class action seeking
certification of the same class that was denied in the New Jersey
matter was filed in Tennessee state court. The court denied
certification in March 2002, and plaintiffs are attempting an appeal.
Cases are continuing on an individual basis.

•

Class certification of recreational vehicle
owners was denied by the Chancery Court of Tennessee, Weakley County in
July 2001, and cases are proceeding on an individual
basis.

•

The U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas denied certification of a putative class
action in March 2002, and the plaintiffs' appeals have been
dismissed by the appellate court. Plaintiff's petition to appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.

•

Four putative class actions are pending in
Canadian courts. Two matters pending in Ontario were consolidated and
denied class certification. This consolidated action is currently on
appeal. The two matters pending in Quebec and British Columbia are
"on hold" pending the outcome of the Ontario
appeal, as in Canadian practice, Ontario tends to be the lead
jurisdiction in such matters. Dupont and Shell have each settled these
matters. Their settlement agreements have been approved by the courts.
Consequently, CNA Holdings remains the only defendant in these
matters.

•

The court in a
putative class action pending in the U.S. Virgin Islands denied
certification to a U.S. territories-wide class and dismissed CNA
Holdings on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs are seeking
reconsideration of those rulings.

•

A
putative nationwide class action was filed in federal court in Indiana
in December 2002, against, among others, CNA Holdings and Shell. CNA
Holdings' motion to dismiss this lawsuit was granted in December
2003. Plaintiffs appealed to the Seventh Circuit in January 2004 and
that appeal was dismissed.

In November 1995, CNA Holdings,
DuPont and Shell entered into national class action settlements, which
have been approved by the courts. The settlements call for the
replacement of plumbing systems of claimants who have had qualifying
leaks, as well as reimbursements for certain leak damage. Furthermore,
the three companies had agreed to fund such replacements and
reimbursements up to $950 million. As of December 31, 2004, the funding
is $1,073 million due to additional contributions and funding
commitments, made primarily by other parties. There are additional
pending lawsuits in approximately ten jurisdictions not covered by this
settlement; however, these cases do not involve (either individually or
in the aggregate) a large number of homes, and management does not
expect the obligations arising from these lawsuits to have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

In 1995, CNA Holdings and Shell
settled the claims of certain individuals, owning 110,000 property
units for an amount not to exceed $170 million. These claimants are
also eligible for a replumb of their homes in accordance with the terms
similar to those of the national class action settlement. CNA
Holdings' and Shell's contributions under this settlement
were subject to allocation as determined by binding arbitration.

CNA Holdings has accrued its best estimate of its share of the
plumbing actions. At December 31, 2004, the Company had remaining
accruals of $73 million for this matter, of which $11 million is
included in current liabilities. Management believes that the plumbing
actions are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial
statements. However, if the Company were to incur an additional charge
for this matter, such a charge would not be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the financial position, but may have a material
adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows of the
Company in any given accounting period. The Company has reached
settlements with CNA Holdings' insurers specifying their
responsibility for these claims; as a result, the Company has recorded
receivables relating to the anticipated recoveries from certain third
party insurance carriers. These receivables are based on the
probability of collection, an opinion of external counsel, the
settlement agreements with the Company's insurance carriers whose
coverage level exceeds the receivables and the status of current
discussions with other insurance carriers. As of December 31, 2004, the
Company has $75 million of receivables related to a settlement with an
insurance carrier. This receivable is discounted and recorded within
Other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as it will be collected
over the next four years.

In February 2005, the Company settled
with an insurance carrier and received cash proceeds of $44 million in
March 2005. This $44 million, included in the $75 million receivable
noted above, was previously not recognized in the Predecessor's
consolidated financial statements and is accounted for as a purchase
price adjustment with a corresponding decrease to goodwill.

Sorbates Litigation

In 1998, Nutrinova Inc., a U.S.
subsidiary of Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients
GmbH, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hoechst, received a grand jury
subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California in connection with a U.S. criminal antitrust investigation
of the sorbates industry. On May 3, 1999, Hoechst and the Government of
the United States of America entered into an agreement under which
Hoechst pled guilty to a one-count indictment charging Hoechst with
participating in a conspiracy to fix prices and allocate market shares
of sorbates sold in the U.S. Hoechst and the U.S. Government agreed to
recommend that the U.S. District Court fine Hoechst $36 million. This
fine was payable over five years, with the last payment of $5 million
being made in June 2004.

F-73

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Hoechst also agreed to cooperate with the
government's investigation and prosecutions related to the
sorbates industry. The U.S. District Court accepted this plea on June
18, 1999 and imposed the penalty as recommended in the plea
agreement.

In addition, several civil antitrust actions by
sorbates customers, seeking monetary damages and other relief for
alleged conduct involving the sorbates industry, have been filed in
U.S. state and federal courts naming Hoechst, Nutrinova, and other
subsidiaries of the Company, as well as other sorbates manufacturers,
as defendants. Many of these actions have been settled and dismissed by
the court.

In July 2001, Hoechst and Nutrinova entered into an
agreement with the Attorneys General of 33 states, pursuant to which
the statutes of limitations were tolled pending the states'
investigations. This agreement expired in July 2003. Since October
2002, the Attorneys General for New York, Illinois, Ohio, Nevada, Utah
and Idaho filed suit on behalf of indirect purchasers in their
respective states. The Utah, Nevada and Idaho actions have been
dismissed as to Hoechst, Nutrinova and the Company. A motion for
reconsideration is pending in Nevada. The Ohio and Illinois actions
have been settled and the Idaho action was dismissed in February 2005.
The New York action is the only Attorney General action still pending.
The court in the New York matter dismissed all antitrust claims;
however other state law claims are still pending. A settlement
agreement with the Attorneys General of Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii,
Maryland, South Carolina, Oregon and Washington is currently being
negotiated and these attorney generals have been granted extensions of
the tolling agreement.

Nutrinova and Hoechst have cooperated
with the European Commission since 1998. In May 2002, the European
Commission informed Hoechst of its intent to investigate officially the
sorbates industry, and in January 2003, the European Commission served
Hoechst, Nutrinova and a number of competitors with a statement of
objections alleging unlawful, anticompetitive behavior affecting the
European sorbates market. In October 2003, the European Commission
ruled that Hoechst, Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries
Ltd., The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. and Ueno Fine
Chemicals Industry Ltd. operated a cartel in the European sorbates
market between 1979 and 1996. The European Commission imposed a total
fine of €138.4 million ($189 million), of which
€99 million ($135 million) was assessed against Hoechst.
The case against Nutrinova was closed. The fine against Hoechst is
based on the European Commission's finding that Hoechst does not
qualify under the leniency policy, is a repeat violator and, together
with Daicel, was a co-conspirator. In Hoechst's favor, the
European Commission gave a discount for cooperating in the
investigation. Hoechst appealed the European Commission's
decision in December 2003. Payment of the obligation is deferred, but
is subject to interest, pending a ruling on the appeal.

Based on
the advice of external counsel and a review of the existing facts and
circumstances relating to the sorbates matter, including the status of
government investigations, as well as civil claims filed and settled,
the Company has remaining accruals of $145 million. This amount is
included in current liabilities at December 31, 2004 for the estimated
loss relative to this matter. Although the outcome of this matter
cannot be predicted with certainty, management's best estimate of
the range of possible additional future losses and fines (in excess of
amounts already accrued), including any that may result from the above
noted governmental proceedings, as of December 31, 2004 is between $0
and $9 million. The estimated range of such possible future losses is
management's best estimate based on the advice of external
counsel taking into consideration potential fines and claims, both
civil and criminal, that may be imposed or made in other
jurisdictions.

Pursuant to the Demerger Agreement with Hoechst,
Celanese AG was assigned the obligation related to the sorbates matter.
However, Hoechst agreed to indemnify Celanese AG for 80 percent of any
costs Celanese may incur relative to this matter. Accordingly, Celanese
AG has recognized a receivable from Hoechst and a corresponding
contribution of capital, net of tax, from this indemnification. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company has receivables, recorded within current
assets, relating to the sorbates indemnification from Hoechst totaling
$116 million. In 2003, Celanese AG recorded a $44 million, net of tax,
increase to additional paid-in capital related to the recoveries from
Hoechst for the special charges

F-74

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

discussed above. The remaining accrual and
the estimated range of possible additional future losses, noted above,
for this matter are gross of any recovery from Hoechst. The Company
believes that any resulting liabilities, net of amounts recoverable
from Hoechst, will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, but may have a
material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows in any
given accounting period.

Shareholder Litigation

Celanese AG, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a
defendant in nine consolidated actions brought by minority shareholders
during August 2004 in the Frankfurt District Court
(

Landgericht

). Among other things, these actions request the
court to set aside shareholder resolutions passed at the extraordinary
general meeting held on July 30 and 31, 2004 based on allegations that
include the alleged violation of procedural requirements and
information rights of the shareholders. Based on the information as
available, the outcome of the foregoing proceedings cannot be predicted
with certainty. The time period to bring forward challenges has
expired.

Further, two minority shareholders instituted public
register proceedings with the Königstein Local Court
(

Amtsgericht)

and the Frankfurt District Court, both with a view
to have the registration of the Domination Agreement in the Commercial
Register deleted (

Amtslöschungsverfahren)

. These actions
are based on an alleged violation of procedure requirements at the
extraordinary general meeting held  July 30 and 31, 2004, an
alleged undercapitalization of the Purchaser and its related entities
at the time of the tender offer, and an alleged misuse of discretion by
the competent court with respect to the registration of the Domination
Agreement in the Commercial Register. Based on the information as
available, the outcome of the foregoing proceedings cannot be predicted
with certainty.

As of the date of this annual report, several
minority shareholders had initiated special award proceedings
(

Spruchverfahren)

seeking the court's review of the
amounts of the fair cash compensation (

Abfindung)

and of the
guaranteed fixed annual payment (

Ausgleich)

offered under the
Domination Agreement. As a result of these proceedings, the amounts of
the fair cash compensation and the guaranteed fixed annual payment
could have been increased by the court so that all minority
shareholders, including those who have already tendered their shares
into the mandatory offer and have received the fair cash compensation,
could claim the respective higher amounts. The Court dismissed these
proceedings on the grounds of inadmissability in March 2005. The
dismissal is subject to appeal.

In February 2005, a former
shareholder of Celanese AG also brought a lawsuit against the Purchaser
as well as a former member of Celanese AG's board of management
and a former member of Celanese AG's supervisory board in the
Frankfurt District Court. Among other things, this action seeks to
unwind the tender of the plaintiff's shares in the Tender Offer
and seeks compensation for damages suffered as a consequence of
tendering shares in the Tender Offer. Based on the information as
available, the outcome of the foregoing proceedings cannot be predicted
with certainty.

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to
guarantee or indemnify third parties for environmental and other
liabilities pursuant to a variety of agreements, including asset and
business divestiture agreements, leases, settlement agreements, and
various agreements with affiliated companies. Although many of these
obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, others do not
provide such limitations.

The Company has accrued for all
probable and reasonably estimable losses associated with all known
matters or claims that have been brought to its attention (See Note
19).

These known obligations include the following:

Demerger Obligations

The Company has obligations to
indemnify Hoechst for various liabilities under the Demerger Agreement
as follows:

F-75

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

•

The Company
agreed to indemnify Hoechst for environmental liabilities associated
with contamination arising under 19 divestiture agreements entered into
by Hoechst prior to the demerger.

The Company's obligation
to indemnify Hoechst is subject to the following
thresholds:

•

The Company will indemnify
Hoechst against those liabilities up to €250 million
(approximately $340 million);

•

Hoechst
will bear those liabilities exceeding €250 million
(approximately $340 million), however the Company will reimburse
Hoechst for one-third of those liabilities for amounts that exceed
€750 million (approximately $1,022 million) in the
aggregate.

The Company's obligation regarding two
agreements has been settled. The aggregate maximum amount of
environmental indemnifications under the remaining divestiture
agreements that provide for monetary limits is approximately
€750 million ($1,022 million). Three of the divested
agreements do not provide for monetary limits.

Based on the
estimate of the probability of loss under this indemnification, the
Company had reserves of $46 million as of December  31,
2004, for this contingency. Where the Company is unable reasonably to
determine the probability of loss or estimate such loss under an
indemnification, the Company has not recognized any related liabilities
(See Note 19).

The Company has also undertaken in the Demerger
Agreement to indemnify Hoechst to the extent that Hoechst is required
to discharge liabilities, including tax liabilities, associated with
businesses that were included in the demerger where such liabilities
were not demerged, due to legal restrictions on the transfers of such
items. These indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time
limitations. The Company has not provided for any reserves associated
with this indemnification. Neither the Company nor the Predecessor did
not make any payments to Hoechst in the nine months ended December 31,
2004, the three months ended March 31, 2004 or the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002 in connection with this indemnification.

Divestiture Obligations

The Company and its predecessor
companies agreed to indemnify third party purchasers of former
businesses and assets for various pre-closing conditions, as well as
for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. Such
liabilities also include environmental liability, product liability,
antitrust and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees
represent standard contractual terms associated with typical
divestiture agreements and, other than environmental liabilities, the
Company does not believe that they expose the Company to any
significant risk.

The Company and the Predecessor have divested
in the aggregate over 20 businesses, investments and facilities,
through agreements containing indemnifications or guarantees to the
purchasers. Many of the obligations contain monetary and/or time
limitations, ranging from one year to 30 years, the aggregate amount of
guarantees provided for under these agreements is approximately $2.9
billion as of December 31, 2004. Other agreements do not provide for
any monetary or time limitations.

Based on historical claims
experience and its knowledge of the sites and businesses involved, the
Company believes that it is adequately reserved for these matters. As
of December 31, 2004, the Company has reserves in the aggregate of $52
million for all such environmental matters.

Plumbing Insurance
Indemnifications

CAG entered into agreements with insurance
companies related to product liability settlements associated with
Celcon

®

plumbing claims. These agreements, except those
with insolvent insurance companies, require the Company to indemnify
and/or defend these insurance companies in the event that third parties
seek additional monies for matters released in these agreements. The
indemnifications in these agreements do not provide for time
limitations.

F-76

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

In certain of the agreements, CAG
received a fixed settlement amount. The indemnities under these
agreements generally are limited to, but in some cases are greater
than, the amount received in settlement from the insurance company. The
maximum exposure under these indemnifications is $95 million. Other
settlement agreements have no stated limits.

There are other
agreements whereby the settling insurer agreed to pay a fixed
percentage of claims that relate to that insurer's policies. The
Company has provided indemnifications to the insurers for amounts paid
in excess of the settlement percentage. These indemnifications do not
provide for monetary or time limitations.

The Company has
reserves associated with these product liability claims. See

Plumbing Actions

above.

Other Obligations

•

The Company is secondarily liable under a
lease agreement pursuant to which the Company has assigned a direct
obligation to a third party. The lease assumed by the third party
expires on April 30, 2012. The lease liability for the period from
January 1, 2005 to April 30, 2012 is estimated to be approximately $55
million.

•

The Company has agreed to
indemnify various insurance carriers, for amounts not in excess of the
settlements received, from claims made against these carriers
subsequent to the settlement. The aggregate amount of guarantees under
these settlements is approximately $10 million, which is unlimited in
term.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the
occurrence of unpredictable future events, the future costs associated
with them cannot be determined at this time. However, the Company were
to incur additional charges for these matters, such charges may have a
material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company in any given accounting
period.

Other Matters

In the normal course of business,
the Company enters into commitments to purchase goods and services over
a fixed period of time. The Company maintains a number of
"take-or-pay" contracts for the purchase of
raw materials and utilities. As of December 31, 2004, there were
outstanding future commitments of approximately $935 million under
take-or-pay contracts. The Company does not expect to incur any losses
under these contractual arrangements. Additionally, as of December 31,
2004, there were outstanding commitments relating to capital projects
of approximately $41 million.

Celanese Ltd. and/or CNA Holdings,
both U.S. subsidiaries of the Company, are defendants in approximately
800 asbestos cases as of December 31, 2004. Because many of these cases
involve numerous plaintiffs, the Company is subject to claims
significantly in excess of the number of actual cases. The Company has
reserves for defense costs related to claims arising from these
matters. The Company believes it does not have any significant exposure
in these matters.

The Company entered into an agreement with
Goldman, Sachs & Co. oHG, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs and Co.,
on December 15, 2003 (the "Goldman Sachs Engagement
Letter"), pursuant to which Goldman Sachs acted as the
Company's financial advisor in connection with the tender offer.
Pursuant to the terms of the Goldman Sachs Engagement Letter, in March
2004, Celanese AG paid Goldman Sachs a financial advisory fee equal to
$13 million and a discretionary bonus equal to $5 million, upon
consummation of the tender offer. In addition, Celanese AG agreed to
reimburse Goldman Sachs for all its reasonable expenses and to
indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons for all direct damages
arising in connection with Goldman Sachs Engagement Letter.

On
July 31, 2003, a federal district court ruled that the formula used in
International Business Machine Corporation's
("IBM") cash balance pension plan violated
the age discrimination provisions of

F-77

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974. The IBM decision, however, conflicts with the decisions from
two other federal district courts and with the proposed regulations for
cash balance plans issued by the Internal Revenue Service in December
2002. IBM has announced that it will appeal the decision to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The effect of the IBM
decision on the Company's cash balance plan cannot be determined
at this time.

28.

Captive Insurance
Companies

The Company consolidates two wholly-owned
insurance companies (the "Captives"). The
Captives are a key component of the Company's global risk
management program as well as a form of self-insurance for property,
liability and workers' compensation risks. The Captives issue
insurance policies to the Company's subsidiaries to provide
consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the insurance market and
to lower long-term insurance costs by avoiding or reducing commercial
carrier overhead and regulatory fees. The Captives issue insurance
policies and coordinate claims handling services with third party
service providers. They retain risk at levels approved by Management
and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net
risk retained. One of the Captives also insures certain third party
risks. Third party premiums earned are shown
below.

F-78

CELANESE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

The
assets of the Captives consist primarily of marketable securities and
reinsurance receivables. Marketable securities values are based on
quoted market prices or dealer quotes. The carrying value of the
amounts recoverable under the reinsurance agreements approximate fair
value due to the short-term nature of these items.

The
liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated risk of
loss recorded by the Captives, which is based on management estimates
and actuarial valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the
portion of the premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of
the policies in-force. The establishment of the provision for
outstanding losses is based upon known facts and interpretation of
circumstances influenced by a variety of factors. In establishing a
provision, management considers facts currently known and the current
state of laws and litigation where applicable. Liabilities are
recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been
developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and management
can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition, liabilities have
been established to cover additional exposure on both known and
unasserted claims. Estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and
updated regularly. It is possible that actual results could differ
significantly from the recorded liabilities.

The Captives use
reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risk of loss. Reinsurance
arrangements, however, do not relieve the Captives from their
obligations to policyholders. Failure of the reinsurers to honor their
obligations could result in losses to the Captives. The Captives
evaluate the financial condition of their reinsurers and monitor
concentrations of credit risk to minimize their exposure to significant
losses from reinsurer insolvencies and establish allowances for amounts
deemed uncollectible.

Premiums written are recognized as revenue
based on the terms of the policies. Capitalization of the Captives is
determined by regulatory guidelines.

In the fourth quarter of 2003,
the Predecessor realigned its business segments to reflect a change of

Products, was introduced and consists primarily of the former Acetyl
Products and Chemical Intermediates segments. Additionally, legacy
pension and other postretirement benefit costs associated with
previously divested Hoechst businesses, which were historically
allocated to the business segments, are reflected as part of Other

systems are based on the same accounting policies as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 4. Celanese
evaluates performance based on operating profit, net earnings (loss),
cash flows and other measures of financial performance reported in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Sales and revenues related to
transactions between segments are generally recorded at values that
approximate third-party selling prices. Revenues and long-term assets
are allocated to countries based on the location of the business.
Capital expenditures represent the purchase of property, plant and
equipment.

The reconciliation column includes (a) operations of
certain other operating entities and their related assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, (b) the elimination of inter-segment sales, (c)
assets and liabilities not allocated to a segment, (d) corporate center
costs for support services such as legal, accounting and treasury
functions and (e) interest income or expense associated with financing
activities of the Company.

Additionally, the Company recognized
special charges in the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 primarily related to restructuring costs and environmental and
other costs associated with previously divested entities of Hoechst,
and demerger costs (See Note 21).

Other operating entities
consist of primarily ancillary businesses as well as companies which
provide infrastructure services.

The following table presents financial
information based on the geographic location of Celanese's
facilities:

Organizational
Restructuring

In October 2004, Celanese Corporation and
certain of its subsidiaries completed an organizational restructuring
(the "Restructuring") pursuant to which the
Purchaser effected, by giving a corresponding instruction under the
Domination Agreement, the transfer of all of the shares of Celanese
Americas Corporation ("CAC") from Celanese
Holding GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celanese AG, to BCP Caylux,
which resulted in BCP Caylux owning 100% of the equity of CAC
and, indirectly, all of its assets, including subsidiary stock. This
transfer was effected by CAG selling all outstanding shares in CAC for
a €291 million note. This note eliminates in
consolidation.

Following the transfer of CAC to BCP Caylux, (1)
Celanese Holdings LLC contributed substantially all of its assets and
liabilities (including all outstanding capital stock of BCP Caylux) to
BCP Crystal in

exchange for all outstanding capital stock of
BCP Crystal and (2) BCP Crystal assumed certain obligations of BCP
Caylux, including all rights and obligations of BCP Caylux under the
senior credit facilities, the floating rate term loan and the senior
subordinated notes. BCP Crystal, at its discretion, may subsequently
cause the liquidation of BCP Caylux.

As a result of these
transactions, BCP Crystal holds 100% of CAC's equity and,
indirectly, all equity owned by CAC in its subsidiaries. In addition,
BCP Crystal holds, indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of
Celanese AG held by the Purchaser and all of the wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee BCP Caylux's
obligations under the senior credit facilities guarantee the senior
subordinated notes issued on June 8, 2004 and July 1, 2004 (see Note
16) on an unsecured senior subordinated basis.

32.

Consolidating Guarantor Financial
Information

In September 2004, Crystal US Holdings 3 LLC
and Crystal US Sub 3 Corp (the "Issuers")
both wholly owned subsidiaries of Celanese Corporation issued senior
discount notes (the "Notes") for gross
proceeds of $513 million (See Note 16). Effective March 2005, Celanese
Corporation (the "Parent Guarantor")
guaranteed the Notes in March 2005 in order that the financial
information required to be filed under the indenture can be filed by
the Company rather than the Issuers. No other subsidiaries guaranteed
these notes.

The Parent Guarantor was formed on February 24,
2004, and the Issuers were formed in September 2004. The Parent
Guarantor and the Issuers held no assets and conducted no operations
prior to the acquisition of the CAG Shares. The Parent Guarantor
currently has no independent assets or operations. Accordingly, there
is no financial information for the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers for
the periods prior to the nine months ended December 31, 2004.

The following consolidating financial statements are presented in
the provided form because:

(i) the Issuers are wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor; (ii) the guarantee is considered
to be full and unconditional, that is, if the Issuers fail to make a
scheduled payment, the Parent Guarantor is obligated to make the
scheduled payment immediately and, if they do not, any holder of notes
may immediately bring suit directly against the Parent Guarantor for
payment of all amounts due and payable.

Separate financial
statements and other disclosures concerning the Parent Guarantor are
not presented because management does not believe that such information
is material to investors.
