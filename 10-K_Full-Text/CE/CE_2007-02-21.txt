    of the ordinary shares of Celanese AG, excluding treasury
    shares, for a purchase price of $1,693 million, including
    direct acquisition costs of $69 million. During the year
    ended December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004, the Purchaser acquired additional CAG
    shares for $473 million and $33 million, respectively,
    including direct acquisition costs of $4 million and less
    than $1 million, respectively. As of December 31,
    2006, our ownership percentage in CAG was approximately 98%. As
    a result of the effective registration of the Squeeze-Out (as
    defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements)
    in the commercial register in December 2006, we acquired the
    remaining 2% of CAG in January 2007.



On November 3, 2004, Blackstone Crystal Holdings Capital
    Partners (Cayman) IV Ltd., reorganized as a Delaware corporation
    and changed its name to Celanese Corporation. Additionally, BCP

    $48 million. Concurrently, we received net proceeds of
    $233 million from the offering of our convertible perpetual
    preferred stock. A portion of the proceeds of the share
    offerings were used to redeem $188 million of our senior
    discount notes and $521 million of our senior subordinated
    notes, excluding early redemption premiums of $19 million
    and $51 million, respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Overview

We are an integrated global hybrid producer of value-added
    industrial chemicals. We are the world’s largest producer
    of acetyl products, including acetic acid and vinyl acetate
    monomer (“VAM”), polyacetal products
    (“POM”), as well as a leading global producer of
    high-performance engineered polymers used in consumer and
    industrial products and designed to meet highly technical
    customer requirements. We believe that approximately 95% of our
    differentiated intermediate and specialty products hold first or
    second market positions globally. Our operations are located
    primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. We believe we are
    one of the lowest-cost producers of key building block chemicals
    in the acetyls chain, such as acetic acid and VAM, due to our
    economies of scale, operating and purchasing efficiencies and
    proprietary production technologies. In addition, we have a
    significant portfolio of strategic investments, including a
    number of ventures in North America, Europe and Asia.
    Collectively, these strategic investments create value for the
    Company and contribute significantly to sales, earnings and cash
    flow.

Our large and diverse global customer base primarily consists of
    major companies in a broad array of industries. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, approximately 33% of our net sales
    were to customers located in North America, 42% to customers in
    Europe and Africa and 25% to customers in Asia and the rest of
    the world.

    alcohol and emulsions. We are a leading global producer of
    acetic acid and the world’s largest producer of VAM. We are
    also the largest polyvinyl alcohol producer in North America.
    These products are generally used as building blocks for
    value-added products or in intermediate chemicals used in the
    paints, coatings, inks, adhesives, films, textiles and building
    products industries. Other chemicals produced in this segment
    are



organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical,
    agricultural and chemical products. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, net sales to external customers of
    acetyls were $2,168 million, acetyl derivatives and polyols
    were $1,083 million and all other business lines combined
    were $1,357 million.

    as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceuticals
    industries.

Competitive
    Strengths

We benefit from a number of competitive strengths, including the
    following:

Leading
    Market Positions

We believe we have the first or second market positions globally
    in approximately 95% of our differentiated intermediate and
    specialty products that make up a majority of our sales. We also
    believe we are a leading global producer of acetic acid and the
    world’s largest producer of VAM. Ticona and our ventures,
    Polyplastics and Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd.
    (“KEPCO”), are leading suppliers of POM and other
    engineering resins in North America, Europe and the Asia/Pacific
    region. Our leadership positions are based on our large share of
    global production capacity, operating efficiencies, proprietary
    technology and competitive cost structures in our major products.

Proprietary
    Production Technology and Operating Expertise

Our production of acetyl products employs industry leading
    proprietary and licensed technologies, including our proprietary
    AO Plus acid-optimization technology for the production of
    acetic acid and VAntage and VAntage Plus vinyl acetate monomer
    technology. AO Plus enables plant capacity to be increased with
    minimal investment, while VAntage and VAntage Plus enables
    significant increases in production efficiencies, lower
    operating costs and increases in capacity at ten to fifteen
    percent of the cost of building a new plant.

Low
    Cost Producer

Our competitive cost structures are based on economies of scale,
    vertical integration, technical know-how and the use of advanced
    technologies.



Global
    Reach

We operate thirty-five production facilities throughout the
    world. The ventures in which we participate operate ten
    additional facilities. Our infrastructure of manufacturing
    plants, terminals, and sales offices provides us with a
    competitive advantage in anticipating and meeting the needs of
    our global and local customers in well-established and growing
    markets, while our geographic diversity reduces the potential
    impact of volatility in any individual country or region. We
    have a strong, growing presence in Asia, particularly in China,
    and we have defined a strategy to continue this growth. Our
    strategy will help us to meet customer demand in this fast
    growing region. For more information regarding our financial
    information with respect to our geographic areas, see
    Note 27 to our consolidated financial statements.

Strategic
    Investments

Our strategic investments, including our ventures, have enabled
    us to gain access, minimize costs and accelerate growth in new
    markets, while also generating significant cash flow and
    earnings. Our equity investments and cost investments represent
    an important component of our growth strategy. See Note 10
    to the consolidated financial statements and
    “Investments” commencing on page 16 of
    Item 1 for additional information on our equity and cost
    investments.

Diversified
    Products and End-Use Markets

We offer our customers a broad range of products in a wide
    variety of end-use markets. For example, Ticona offers customers
    a broad range of high-quality engineering plastics to meet the
    needs of customers in numerous end-use markets, such as
    automotive, electrical/electronics, appliance and medical.
    Chemical Products has leading market positions in an integrated
    chain of basic and performance-based acetyl products that are
    sold into diverse industrial applications. This product and
    market diversity helps us to reduce the potential impact of
    volatility in any individual market segment.

Business
    Strategies

We are focused on increasing operating cash flows,
    profitability, return on investment and shareholder value, which
    we believe can be achieved through the following business
    strategies:

Execution
    and Productivity

We continually seek ways to reduce our production and raw
    material costs. We have established an operational excellence
    culture which has enabled us to make productivity improvements.
    Most significantly, Six Sigma is a pervasive and important tool
    being used in both operations and administration for achieving
    greater productivity and growth. We continue to pursue
    opportunities and process technology improvements focused on
    energy reduction. We will also continue using best practices to
    reduce costs and increase equipment reliability in maintenance
    and project engineering. Global operational excellence is an
    integral part of our strategy to maintain our cost advantage and
    productivity leadership.

Focused
    Portfolio

We continue to further optimize our business portfolio through
    divestitures, acquisitions and strategic investments that enable
    us to focus on businesses in which we can achieve market, cost
    and technology leadership over the long term. In addition, we
    intend to expand our product mix into higher value-added
    products.

Growth

We are investing strategically in growth areas and adding new
    production capacity, when appropriate, to extend our global
    market leadership position. Historically, our strong market
    position has enabled us to initiate capacity growth to take
    advantage of projected demand growth. For example, we are
    building a 600,000 metric ton per year world-scale acetic acid
    plant in China, the world’s fastest growing market for
    acetic acid and its derivatives. The plant is scheduled for
    commercial sales in 2007. As part of our growth strategy, we
    also continue to develop new



products and industry-leading production technologies that
    deliver value-added solutions for our customers. For example,
    Ticona has worked closely with fuel system suppliers to develop
    an acetal copolymer with the chemical and impact resistance
    necessary to withstand exposure to hot diesel fuels. In our
    emulsions business, we pioneered a technological solution that
    leads the industry in product offerings for ecologically
    friendly emulsions for solvent-free interior paints. We believe
    that our customers value our expertise, and we will continue to
    work with them to enhance the quality of their products.

Business
    Segments

For more information with respect to the financial results and
    conditions of our business segments, see Note 27 to our
    consolidated financial statements.

Chemical
    Products

The Chemical Products segment consists of six business lines:
    Acetyls, Acetyl Derivatives and Polyols, Polyvinyl Alcohol,
    Emulsions, Specialties, and other chemical activities. All
    business lines in this segment conduct business mainly using the
    “Celanese” trade name, except Polyvinyl Alcohol, which
    uses the trademarks Celvol and Erkol, Emulsions, which uses the
    trademarks Mowilith and Celvolit, Vinamul, Elite and Duroset.
    See Item 1. Business — Segment Overview for
    discussion of key products and major end-use markets.

Business
    Lines

Acetyls.

The acetyls business line produces:

•

Acetic acid, used to manufacture VAM, other acetyl derivatives
    and other end uses, including purified terephthalic acid
    (“PTA”). We manufacture acetic acid for our own use,
    as well as for sale to third parties, including other
    participants in the acetyl derivatives business;

•

VAM, used in a variety of adhesives, paints, films, coatings and
    textiles. We manufacture VAM for our own use, as well as for
    sale to third parties;

•

Methanol, principally sold to the merchant market;

•

Acetic anhydride, a raw material used in the production of
    cellulose acetate, detergents and pharmaceuticals; and

•

Acetaldehyde, a major feedstock for the production of polyols.
    Acetaldehyde is also used in other organic compounds such as
    pyridines, which are used in agricultural products.

Acetic acid, methanol and VAM, our basic products, are directly
    impacted by the global supply/demand balance for each of the
    products and can be described as cyclical in nature. The
    principal raw materials in these products are natural gas and
    ethylene, which we purchase from numerous sources; carbon
    monoxide, which we both manufacture and purchase under long-term
    contracts; methanol, which we both manufacture and purchase
    under long-term and short-term contracts; and butane, which we
    purchase from one supplier and can also obtain from other
    sources. All these raw materials, except carbon monoxide, are
    commodities and are available from a wide variety of sources.

Our production of acetyl products employs leading proprietary
    and licensed technologies, including our proprietary AO Plus
    acid-optimization technology for the production of acetic acid
    and VAntage and VAntage Plus vinyl acetate monomer technology.

Acetyl Derivatives and Polyols.

The acetyl
    derivatives and polyols business line produces a variety of
    solvents, polyols, formaldehyde and other chemicals, which in
    turn are used in the manufacture of paints, coatings, adhesives
    and other products.



Many acetyl derivatives products are derived from our production
    of acetic acid and oxo alcohols. Primary products are:

•

Ethyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in
    coatings, inks and adhesives and in the manufacture of
    photographic films and coated papers;

•

Butyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in inks,
    pharmaceuticals and perfume;

•

Propyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in inks,
    lacquers and plastics;

•

Methyl ethyl ketone, a solvent used in the production of
    printing inks and magnetic tapes;

•

Butyric acid, an intermediate for the production of esters used
    in artificial flavors;

•

Propionic acid, an organic acid used to protect and preserve
    grain; and

•

Formic acid, an organic acid used in textile dyeing and leather
    tanning.

Polyols and formaldehyde products are derivatives of methanol
    and are made up of the following products:

•

Formaldehyde, primarily used to produce adhesive resins for
    plywood, particle board, POM engineering resins and a compound
    used in making polyurethane;

•

Polyol products such as trimethylolpropane, used in synthetic
    lubricants; neopentyl glycol, used in powder coatings; and
    1,3-butylene glycol, used in flavorings and plasticizers.

Oxo alcohols and intermediates are produced from propylene and
    ethylene and include:

•

Butanol, used as a solvent for lacquers, dopes and thinners, and
    as an intermediate in the manufacture of chemicals, such as
    butyl acrylate;

•

Propanol, used as an intermediate in the production of amines
    for agricultural chemicals, and as a solvent for inks, resins,
    insecticides and waxes.

Acetyl derivatives and polyols are commodity products
    characterized by cyclicality in pricing. The principal raw
    materials used in the acetyl derivatives business line are
    acetic acid, various alcohols, methanol, acetaldehyde,
    propylene, ethylene and synthesis gas. We manufacture many of
    these raw materials for our own use as well as for sales to
    third parties, including our competitors in the acetyl
    derivatives business. We purchase propylene and ethylene from a
    variety of sources. We manufacture acetaldehyde for our European
    production, but we purchase all acetaldehyde requirements for
    our North American operations from third parties. Acetaldehyde
    is also available from other sources.

Polyvinyl Alcohol.

Polyvinyl alcohol
    (“PVOH”) is a performance chemical engineered to
    satisfy particular customer requirements. It is used in
    adhesives, building products, paper coatings, films and
    textiles. The primary raw material to produce PVOH is VAM, while
    acetic acid is produced as a by-product. Prices vary depending
    on industry segment and end use application. Products are sold
    on a global basis, and competition is from all regions of the
    world. Therefore, regional economies and supply and demand
    balances affect the level of competition in other regions.
    According to industry sources on PVOH, we are the largest North
    American producer of PVOH and the third largest producer in the
    world.

Emulsions.

The products in our emulsions
    business include conventional emulsions and high-pressure vinyl
    acetate ethylene emulsions. Emulsions are made from VAM,
    acrylate esters and styrene. They are a key component of
    water-based quality surface coatings, adhesives, non-woven
    textiles and other applications.

Specialties.

The specialties business line
    produces:

•

Carboxylic acids such as pelargonic acid, used in detergents and
    synthetic lubricants, and heptanoic acid, used in plasticizers
    and synthetic lubricants;

•

Amines such as methyl amines, used in agrochemicals,
    monoisopropynol amines, used in herbicides, and butyl amines,
    used in the treatment of rubber and in water treatment; and



•

Oxo derivatives and special solvents, such as crotonaldehyde,
    which is used by the Performance Products segment for the
    production of sorbates, as well as raw materials for the
    fragrance and food ingredients industry.

The prices for these products are relatively stable due to
    long-term contracts with customers whose industries are not
    generally subject to the cyclical trends of commodity chemicals.

The primary raw materials for these products are olefins and
    ammonia, which are purchased from world market suppliers based
    on international prices.

In December 2006, we announced plans to sell the oxo products
    and derivatives businesses as part of our strategy to optimize
    our portfolio and divest non-core businesses. See Note 32
    to the consolidated financial statements for additional
    information.

During the third quarter of 2006, we discontinued our
    Pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations.

Facilities

Chemical Products has production sites in the United States,
    Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, the United
    Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Germany. The emulsions
    business line also has tolling arrangements in France. We also
    participate in a venture in Saudi Arabia that produces methanol
    and Methyl Tertiary-Butyl Ether (“MTBE”). Over the
    last few years, we have continued to shift our production
    capacity to lower cost production facilities while expanding in
    growth markets, such as China. As a result, we shut down our
    formaldehyde unit in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in mid-2004 and
    announced in August 2005 that we intend to close this facility
    in 2007.

Technical
    Polymers Ticona

The Ticona segment develops, produces and supplies a broad
    portfolio of high performance technical polymers. See
    Item 1. Business — Segment Overview for
    discussion of key products and major end-use markets.

Ticona technical polymers have chemical and physical properties
    enabling them, among other things, to withstand high
    temperatures, resist chemical reactions with solvents and resist
    fracturing or stretching. These products are used in a wide
    range of performance-demanding applications in the automotive
    and electronics sectors and in other consumer and industrial
    goods, often replacing metal or glass. Demand for high
    performance polymers is expected to grow approximately 5% to 6%
    per year.

Ticona works in concert with its customers to enable innovations
    and develop new or enhanced products. Ticona focuses its efforts
    on developing new markets and applications for its product
    lines, often developing custom formulations to satisfy the
    technical and processing requirements of a customer’s
    applications. For example, Ticona has worked closely with fuel
    system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with the
    chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure
    to hot diesel fuels in the new generation of common rail diesel
    engines. The product can also be used in automotive fuel sender
    units where it remains stable at the high operating temperatures
    present in direct-injection diesel engines or meet the
    requirements of the new generation of bio fuels.

Ticona’s customer base consists primarily of a large number
    of plastic molders and component suppliers, which are often the
    primary suppliers to original equipment manufacturers
    (“OEM”). Ticona works with these molders and component
    suppliers as well as directly with the OEMs to develop and
    improve specialized applications and systems.

Prices for most of these products, particularly specialized
    product grades for targeted applications, generally reflect the
    value added in complex polymer chemistry, precision formulation
    and compounding, and the extensive application development
    services provided. The specialized product lines are not
    particularly susceptible to cyclical swings in pricing.



Business
    Lines

POM is sold under the trademark Hostaform in all regions but
    North America, where it is sold under the trademark Celcon.
    Polyplastics and KEPCO are leading suppliers of POM and other
    engineering resins in the

Asia/Pacific

region. POM is used for mechanical parts, including door locks
    and seat belt mechanisms, in automotive applications and in
    electrical, consumer and medical applications such as drug
    delivery systems and gears for large appliances.

The primary raw material for POM is formaldehyde, which is
    manufactured from methanol. Ticona currently purchases
    formaldehyde in the United States from our Chemical Products
    segment and, in Europe, manufactures formaldehyde from purchased
    methanol.

GUR, an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene
    (“UHMW-PE”), is an engineered material used in
    heavy-duty automotive and industrial applications such as car
    battery separator panels and industrial conveyor belts, as well
    as in specialty medical and consumer applications, such as
    sports equipment and prostheses. GUR micro powder grades are
    used for high performance filters, membranes, diagnostic
    devices, coatings and additives for thermoplastics &
    elastomers. GUR fibers are also used in protective ballistic
    applications.

Celstran and Compel are long fiber reinforced thermoplastics,
    which impart extra strength and stiffness, making them more
    suitable for larger parts than conventional thermoplastics.

Polyesters such as Celanex PBT, Vandar, a series of
    PBT-polyester blends and Riteflex, a thermoplastic polyester
    elastomer, are used in a wide variety of automotive, electrical
    and consumer applications, including ignition system parts,
    radiator grilles, electrical switches, appliance housings,
    sensor housings, LEDs and technical fibers. Raw materials for
    polyesters vary. Base monomers, such as dimethyl terephthalate
    and PTA, are widely available with pricing dependent on broader
    polyester fiber and packaging resins market conditions. Smaller
    volume specialty co-monomers for these products are typically
    supplied by a few companies.

Liquid crystal polymers (“LCP”), such as Vectra, are
    used in electrical and electronics applications and for
    precision parts with thin walls and complex shapes or on high
    heat cookware application.

Fortron, a polyphenylene sulfide (“PPS”) product, is
    used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications,
    especially those requiring heat

and/or

chemical resistance, including fuel system parts, radiator pipes
    and halogen lamp housings, and often replaces metal in these
    demanding applications. Other possible application fields
    include non-woven filtration devices such as coal fired power
    plants. Fortron is manufactured by Fortron Industries LLC,
    Ticona’s

50-50

venture with Kureha Corporation (“KCI”) of Japan.

In December 2004, we approved a plan to dispose of our
    Cyclo-olefine Copolymer (“COC”) business. The sale of
    the COC business was completed in December 2005.

Facilities

Ticona has polymerization, compounding and research and
    technology centers in Germany, Brazil and the United States.
    Ticona’s Kelsterbach, Germany production site is located in
    close proximity to one of the sites being considered for a new
    runway under the Frankfurt airport’s expansion plans. In
    November 2006, we announced a settlement with the Frankfurt
    Airport (“Fraport”) to relocate the Kelsterbach,
    Germany operations. The terms of the settlement, which is
    intended to be cost and tax neutral for Celanese, should allow
    Ticona adequate time and resources to select a site, build new
    production facilities and transition business activities within
    Germany to a new location by mid-2011. See Note 31 to the
    consolidated financial statements for further information.

Ticona’s sales in the Asian market are made mainly through
    its ventures, Polyplastics, KEPCO and Fortron Industries, which
    are accounted for under the equity method and therefore not
    included in Ticona’s consolidated net sales. If
    Ticona’s portion of the sales made by these ventures were
    included in the chart above, the percentage of sales sold in
    Asia/Australia would be substantially higher. A number of
    Ticona’s POM customers, particularly in the appliance,
    electrical components, toys and certain sections of the
    electronics/telecommunications fields, have moved tooling and
    molding operations to Asia, particularly southern China. To meet
    the expected increased demand in this region, we, along with
    Polyplastics, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company Inc., and KEPCO
    agreed on a venture which operates a world-scale 60,000 metric
    ton POM facility in Nantong, China. Through our investment in
    the aforementioned companies, we indirectly own an approximate
    38% interest in this venture. The new plant commenced operations
    in 2005.

Ticona’s principal customers are consumer product
    manufacturers and suppliers to the automotive industries. These
    customers primarily produce engineered products, and Ticona
    works closely with its customers to assist them to develop and
    improve specialized applications and systems. Ticona has
    long-standing relationships with most of its major customers,
    but it also uses distributors for most of its major products, as
    well as a number of electronic channels, such as its
    BuyTiconaDirect on-line ordering system, and other electronic
    marketplaces to reach a larger customer base. For most of
    Ticona’s product lines, contracts with customers typically
    have a term of one to two years. A significant swing in the
    economic conditions of the end markets of Ticona’s
    principal customers could significantly affect the demand for
    Ticona’s products.

Competition

Ticona’s principal competitors include BASF, DuPont, DSM
    N.V., General Electric Company and Solvay S.A. Smaller regional
    competitors include Asahi Kasei Corporation, Mitsubishi Gas
    Chemicals, Inc., Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, L.P.,
    Braskem S.A., Lanxess AG, Teijin, Sumitomo, Inc. and Toray
    Industries Inc.

Acetate
    Products

The Acetate Products segment consists of acetate filter products
    or acetate tow and acetate flake, which uses the
    “Celanese” brand to market its products. The acetate
    tow market continues to be characterized by stability and
    expected global growth of between 1% and 2% per year. The
    segment’s acetate filament business line was discontinued
    in the fourth quarter of 2005. See Item 1.
    Business — Segment Overview for discussion of key
    products and major end-use markets.



Business
    Lines

Acetate tow is used primarily in cigarette filters. According to
    the 2006 Stanford Research Institute International Chemical
    Economics Handbook, we are the world’s leading producer of
    acetate tow, including production of our ventures in Asia.

We produce acetate flake by processing wood pulp with acetic
    anhydride. We purchase wood pulp that is made from reforested
    trees from major suppliers and produce acetic anhydride
    internally. The acetate flake is then further processed into
    acetate fiber in the form of a tow band.

We have an approximate 30% interest in three manufacturing
    ventures in China that produce cellulose acetate flake and tow.
    Our partner in each of the ventures is a Chinese state-owned
    tobacco entity. In addition, 12% of our 2006 acetate tow sales
    were sold directly to China, the largest single market for
    acetate tow in the world. Two of the ventures completed tow
    expansions in January 2005, and the third venture completed its
    tow expansion in June 2005. Flake expansion is expected to be
    completed in 2007. Although our direct tow sales into China have
    decreased as a result of the venture expansions, the future
    dividends that we expect to receive from these ventures are
    projected to increase.

Acetate Products is continuing its productivity and operations
    improvement efforts. These efforts are directed toward reducing
    costs while achieving higher productivity of employees and
    equipment. In addition to our operating sites’
    restructuring activities previously undertaken, we closed our
    Charlotte, North Carolina administrative and research and
    development facility. In July 2005, we relocated our Rock Hill,
    South Carolina administrative functions to our Dallas corporate
    headquarters. In December 2005, we sold our Rock Hill and
    Charlotte sites.

Facilities

Acetate Products has production sites in the United States,
    Canada, Mexico and Belgium, and participates in three
    manufacturing ventures in China. In October 2004, we announced
    plans to discontinue our filament business, with operations at
    our Narrows, Virginia and Ocotlan, Mexico sites, which occurred
    in the fourth quarter of 2005. Additionally, we announced our
    intentions to shutdown our high cost operations at our Rock
    Hill, South Carolina flake production site and our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada flake and tow production site. We shutdown our
    Rock Hill flake and Edmonton tow operations in the second
    quarter of 2005 and will shutdown our Edmonton flake facility in
    early 2007. In addition to the above closures, we
    re-commissioned our flake operations at Ocotlan in the first
    quarter of 2005.

pricing for targeted applications reflects the value added by
    Nutrinova, such as technical services provided and consistency
    of product quality. Nutrinova’s strategy is to be the most
    reliable and highest quality producer of this product, to
    develop new applications for the product and to expand into new
    markets. Nutrinova maintains a strict patent enforcement
    strategy, which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number
    of patent infringement matters in Europe and the United States.
    Nutrinova’s European and U.S. primary production
    patents for making
    Sunett

®

expired at the end of the first quarter of 2005.

Nutrinova’s food protection ingredients are mainly used in
    foods, beverages and personal care products. The primary raw
    materials for these products are ketene and crotonaldehyde.
    Sorbates pricing is extremely sensitive to demand and industry
    capacity and is not necessarily dependent on the prices of raw
    materials.

Diketene and ketene are both derivatives of acetic acid, one of
    the primary products of the Chemical Products segment.

Other
    Activities

Other Activities includes revenues mainly from the captive
    insurance companies, Pemeas GmbH (“Pemeas”) until
    December 2005 and, since July 2005, AT Plastics. Pemeas develops
    high temperature membrane assemblies (“MEA”) for fuel
    cells. We contributed our MEA activity to Pemeas in April 2004.
    In December 2005, we sold our common stock interest back to
    Pemeas Corporation. In December 2006, we sold our preferred
    interest in Pemeas Corporation to BASF. Other Activities also
    includes corporate activities, several service companies and
    other ancillary businesses, which do not have significant sales.

Our two wholly-owned captive insurance companies are a key
    component of our global risk management program, as well as a
    form of self insurance for our property, liability and workers
    compensation risks. The captive insurance companies issue
    insurance policies to our subsidiaries to provide consistent
    coverage amid fluctuating costs in the insurance market and to
    lower long-term insurance costs by avoiding or reducing
    commercial carrier overhead and regulatory fees. The captive
    insurance companies issue insurance policies and coordinate
    claims handling services with third party service providers.
    They retain risk at levels approved by our board of directors
    and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the
    net risk retained. One of the captive insurance companies also
    insures certain third party risks.

Investments

We have a significant portfolio of strategic investments,
    including a number of ventures, in Asia, North America and
    Europe. In aggregate, these strategic investments enjoy
    significant sales, earnings and cash flow. We have entered into
    these strategic investments in order to gain access to local
    markets, minimize costs and accelerate



growth in areas we believe have significant future business
    potential. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial

Other
    Equity Investments

InfraServs.

We hold ownership interests in
    several InfraServ groups located in Germany. InfraServs own and
    develop industrial parks and provide

on-site

general and administrative support to tenants.

Major
    Cost Investments

National Methanol Co. (Ibn Sina).

With
    production facilities in Saudi Arabia, National Methanol Co.
    represents 2% of the world’s methanol production capacity
    and is the world’s eighth largest producer of MTBE.
    Methanol and MTBE are key global commodity chemical products. We
    indirectly own a 25% interest in National



Methanol Co., with the remainder held by SABIC (50%) and Texas
    Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. (25%). SABIC has responsibility
    for all product marketing.

China Acetate Products Ventures.

We hold
    approximately 30% ownership interests (50% board representation)
    in three separate Acetate Products production entities in China:
    the Nantong, Kunming and Zhuhai Cellulose Fiber Companies. In
    each instance, Chinese state-owned entities control the
    remainder. The ventures fund investments using operating cash
    flows.

Certain cost investments where we own greater than a 20%
    ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of
    accounting because we cannot exercise significant influence, are
    not involved in the

day-to-day

operations and are unable to obtain timely U.S. GAAP
    financial information from these entities.

Raw
    Materials and Energy

We purchase a variety of raw materials from sources in many
    countries for use in our production processes. We have a policy
    of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for
    materials. However, some of our individual plants may have
    single sources of supply for some of their raw materials, such
    as carbon monoxide, steam and acetaldehyde. Although we have
    been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials, there
    can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect
    our raw material supply. Even if we have multiple sources of
    supply for a raw material, there can be no assurance that these
    sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier. There
    cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected
    should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply in
    the event of the loss of a sole supplier. In addition, the price
    of raw materials varies, often substantially, from year to year.

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are
    commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply/demand
    fundamentals change. Our production facilities rely largely on
    coal, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity for energy. Most of
    the raw materials for our European operations are centrally
    purchased by our subsidiary, which also buys raw materials on
    behalf of third parties. We manage our exposure through the use
    of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for
    commodity price hedging, entering into long-term supply
    agreements and multi-year purchasing and sales agreements. See
    Notes 4 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

We also currently lease supplies of various precious metals,
    such as rhodium, used as catalysts for the manufacture of
    chemical products. With growing demand for these precious
    metals, most notably in the automotive industry, the cost to
    purchase or lease these precious metals has increased, caused by
    a shortage in supply. For precious metals, the leases are
    distributed between a minimum of three lessors per product and
    are divided into several contracts. Although we seek to offset
    increases in raw material prices with corresponding increases in
    the prices of our products, we may not be able to do so, and
    there may be periods when such product price increases lag
    behind raw material cost increases.

Research
    and Development

All of our businesses conduct research and development
    activities to increase competitiveness. Our businesses are
    innovation-oriented and conduct research and development
    activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production
    technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new
    products and applications. We consider the amount spent during
    each of the last three fiscal years on research and development
    activities to be adequate to drive our growth program.

Intellectual
    Property

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    product and process developments in our major markets. Patents
    may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product
    uses. We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means
    of protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names
    become more important once the corresponding



patents have expired. We protect our trademarks vigorously
    against infringement and also seek to register design protection
    where appropriate.

In most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new
    substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications
    and production processes. However, we do business in regions of
    the world where intellectual property protection may be limited
    and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information
    security policies and procedures wherever we do business. Such
    information security policies and procedures include data
    encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of
    confidential information, as well as employee awareness
    training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors and vigorously
    challenge patent and trademark infringement. For example,
    Chemical Products maintains a strict patent enforcement
    strategy, which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number
    of patent infringement matters in Europe, Asia and the United
    States. We are currently pursuing a number of matters relating
    to the infringement of our acetic acid patents. Some of our
    earlier acetic acid patents will expire in 2007; other patent
    applications covering acetic acid are presently pending.

Neither our business as a whole nor any particular segment is
    materially dependent upon any one particular patent, trademark,
    copyright or trade secret.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 8,900
    employees worldwide from continuing operations, compared to
    9,300 as of December 31, 2005. This represents a decrease
    of approximately 4%. The following table sets forth the
    approximate number of employees on a continuing basis as of
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Many of our employees are unionized, particularly in Germany,
    Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Belgium and France. However, in the
    United States, less than one quarter of our employees are
    unionized. Moreover, in Germany and France, wages and general
    working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated
    collective bargaining agreements. Within the limits established
    by these agreements, our various subsidiaries negotiate directly
    with the unions and other labor organizations, such as
    workers’ councils, representing the employees. Collective
    bargaining agreements between the German chemical employers
    associations and unions relating to remuneration typically have
    a term of one year, while in the United States a three year term
    for collective bargaining agreements is typical. We offer
    comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and
    believe our relations with employees are satisfactory.



Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the
    level of future sales activity. In general, we do not
    manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production
    and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders
    as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe
    that backlog information is not material to understanding our
    overall business and should not be considered a reliable
    indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of
    revenue or financial performance.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Many factors could have an effect on our financial condition,
    cash flows and results of operations. We are subject to various
    risks resulting from changing economic, environmental,
    political, industry, business and financial conditions. The
    factors described below represent our principal risks.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    an international company and are exposed to general economic,
    political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries
    in which we have significant operations.

We operate in the global market and have customers in many
    countries. We have major facilities located in North America,
    Europe and Asia, hold interests in ventures that operate in
    Germany, China, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Our
    principal customers are similarly global in scope, and the
    prices of our most significant products are typically world
    market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results
    are affected directly and indirectly by world economic,
    political and regulatory conditions.

Conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war,
    terrorist activities, epidemics, pandemics or political
    instability in any of the countries in which we operate could
    affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery
    of raw materials and products as well as increasing security
    costs, insurance premiums and other expenses. These conditions
    could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the
    United States, Europe, Asia or elsewhere. Moreover, changes in
    laws or regulations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory
    requirements (including import or export licensing
    requirements), or changes in the reporting requirements of the
    United States, German or European Union governmental agencies,
    could increase the cost of doing business in these regions. Any
    of these conditions may have an effect on our business and
    financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current
    and future prices for our securities, including our stock.

The
    industries of many of our customers, particularly the
    automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries are
    cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in economic
    conditions. A downturn in one or more of these industries may
    result in a reduction in our operating margins or in operating
    losses.

Some of the markets in which our customers participate, such as
    the automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries,
    are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us which is beyond
    our control. These markets are



highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use markets,
    and may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand
    for and pricing of our products.

We are
    subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the
    prices and availability of key raw materials and
    energy.

We purchase significant amounts of natural gas, ethylene,
    butane, methanol and propylene from third parties for use in our
    production of basic chemicals in the Chemical Products segment,
    principally formaldehyde, acetic acid and VAM. We use a portion
    of our output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in the
    production of further products in all our segments. We also
    purchase significant amounts of cellulose or wood pulp for use
    in our production of cellulose acetate in the Acetate Products
    segment. We purchase significant amounts of natural gas,
    electricity, coal and fuel oil to supply the energy required in
    our production processes. Prices of natural gas, oil and other
    hydrocarbons and energy increased dramatically in 2006 and 2005.

We own or lease supplies of various precious metals, such as
    rhodium, used as catalysts for the production of these
    chemicals. With growing demand for these precious metals, most
    notably in the automotive industry, the cost to purchase or
    lease these precious metals has increased, caused by a shortage
    in supply.

We are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw
    materials and energy. Although we have agreements providing for
    the supply of natural gas, ethylene, propylene, wood pulp,
    electricity, coal and fuel oil, the contractual prices for these
    raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be
    highly volatile. Factors which have caused volatility in our raw
    material prices in the past and which may do so in the future
    include:

•

Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from
    growing uses or new uses;

•

Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, strike
    action or involuntary shutdowns;

•

The general level of business and economic activity; and

•

The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.

If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy
    and raw material costs, or if such commodities were unavailable,
    it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial
    results.

Failure
    to develop new products and production technologies or to
    implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives
    successfully may harm our competitive position.

Our operating results, especially in our Performance Products
    and Ticona segments, depend significantly on the development of
    commercially viable new products, product grades and
    applications, as well as production technologies. If we are
    unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and
    production processes in the future, our competitive position and
    operating results may be negatively affected. Likewise, we have
    undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all
    segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate
    cost savings. These initiatives may not be completed or
    beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities
    may not be realized.

Environmental
    regulations and other obligations relating to environmental
    matters could subject us to liability for fines,

clean-ups

and other damages, require us to incur significant costs to
    modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and
    delivery costs.

Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and potential obligations with respect to
    contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our
    operating results. These include obligations related to sites
    currently or formerly owned or operated by us, or where waste
    from our operations was disposed. We also have obligations
    related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and
    transfer agreement between CAG and Hoechst, also referred to as
    the demerger agreement, for environmental matters arising out of
    certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates — Environmental
    Liabilities” and Notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated
    financial statements.



Our operations are subject to extensive international, national,
    state, local, and other supranational laws and regulations that
    govern environmental and health and safety matters. We incur
    substantial capital and other costs to comply with these
    requirements. If we violate them, we can be held liable for
    substantial fines and other sanctions, including limitations on
    our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of
    environmental permits involved. Stricter environmental, safety
    and health laws, regulations and enforcement policies could
    result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations
    on our operations and could subject our handling, manufacture,
    use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more
    rigorous scrutiny than at present. Consequently, compliance with
    these laws and regulations could result in significant capital
    expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, which could
    cause our business and operating results to be less favorable
    than expected.

We are also involved in several claims, lawsuits and
    administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. An
    adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our
    earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period.

Changes
    in environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements
    could lead to a decrease in demand for our
    products.

New or revised governmental regulations relating to health,
    safety and the environment may also affect demand for our
    products.

Pursuant to the European Union regulation on Risk Assessment of
    Existing Chemicals, the European Chemicals Bureau of the
    European Commission has been conducting risk assessments on
    approximately 140 major chemicals. Some of the chemicals
    initially being evaluated include VAM, which we produce. These
    risk assessments entail a multi-stage process to determine to
    what extent the European Commission should classify the chemical
    as a carcinogen and, if so, whether this classification and
    related labeling requirements should apply only to finished
    products that contain specified threshold concentrations of a
    particular chemical. In the case of VAM, we currently do not
    expect a final ruling until the end of 2007. We and other VAM
    producers are participating in this process with detailed
    scientific analyses supporting the industry’s position that
    VAM is not a probable human carcinogen and that labeling of
    final products should not be required. We cannot predict the
    outcome or effect of any final ruling.

Several recent studies have investigated possible links between
    formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia.
    The International Agency for Research on Cancer or IARC recently
    reclassified formaldehyde from Group 2A (probable human
    carcinogen) to Group 1 (known human carcinogen) based on studies
    linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare
    cancer in humans. IARC also concluded that there is insufficient
    evidence for a causal association between leukemia and
    occupational exposure to formaldehyde, although it also
    characterized evidence for such an association as strong. The
    results of IARC’s review will be examined by government
    agencies with responsibility for setting worker and
    environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements. We
    are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from
    formaldehyde. We are participating together with other producers
    and users in the evaluations of these findings. We cannot
    predict the final effect of IARC’s reclassification.

Other recent initiatives will potentially require toxicological
    testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals,
    including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives
    include the Voluntary Children’s Chemical Evaluation
    Program and High Production Volume Chemical Initiative in the
    United States, as well as various European Commission programs,
    such as the new European Environment and Health Strategy,
    commonly known as SCALE, as well as the Proposal for the
    Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of
    Chemicals or REACH. REACH, which the European Commission
    proposed in October 2003, will establish a system to register
    and evaluate chemicals manufactured in, or imported to, the
    European Union. Additional testing, documentation and risk
    assessments will occur for the chemical industry. This will
    affect European producers of chemicals as well as all chemical
    companies worldwide that export to member states of the European
    Union.

The above-mentioned assessments in the United States and Europe
    may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved
    and additional requirements being placed on the production,
    handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such
    concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost
    incurred by our customers to



use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these
    products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these
    products. Such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse
    impact on our business and results of operations.

Our
    production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and
    hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that
    could have a negative effect on our operating
    results.

Our operations are subject to operating risks associated with
    chemical manufacturing, including the related storage and
    transportation of raw materials, products and waste. These risks
    include, among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and
    ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or releases of
    toxic or hazardous substances.

These operating risks can cause personal injury, property damage
    and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown
    of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal
    penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt
    production and have a negative effect on the productivity and
    profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our
    operating results and cash flows.

Recently
    proposed federal legislation aimed at increasing security at
    certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that
    may be proposed in the future could, if passed into law, require
    us to relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us
    to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical
    products, thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Legislation is currently pending in Congress which is aimed at
    decreasing the risk, and effects, of potential terrorist attacks
    on chemical plants located within the United States. Pursuant to
    proposed legislation, these goals would be accomplished in part
    through the requirement that certain high-priority facilities
    develop a prevention, preparedness, and response plan after
    conducting a vulnerability assessment. In addition, companies
    may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less
    dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their
    vulnerability assessments and prevention plans and implementing
    feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential
    damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack. Pending
    legislation will likely be revised further, and additional
    legislation may be proposed in the future on this topic. It is
    possible that such future legislation could contain terms that
    are more restrictive than what has recently been proposed and
    which would be more costly to us. We cannot predict the final
    form of currently pending legislation, or other related
    legislation that may be passed and can provide no assurance that
    such legislation will not have an adverse effect on our results
    of operations in a future reporting period.

Our
    significant

non-U.S. operations

expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could
    adversely impact our profitability.

We are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial
    operations. Our market risk consists principally of exposure to
    fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates. As we
    conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the
    United States, fluctuations in currencies of other countries,
    especially the euro, may materially affect our operating
    results. For example, changes in currency exchange rates may
    decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our
    competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and
    increase the cost of items required in our operations.

A substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In our consolidated
    financial statements, we translate our local currency financial
    results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates
    prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the
    end of that period. During times of a strengthening
    U.S. dollar, at a constant level of business, our reported
    international sales, earnings, assets and liabilities will be
    reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer
    U.S. dollars.

In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency
    transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries
    enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a
    currency different from the operating subsidiary’s
    functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we
    may not be able to manage our currency transaction and
    translation risks effectively, and volatility in currency
    exchange rates may expose our financial



condition or results of operations to a significant additional
    risk. Since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be
    denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, a
    weakening of the U.S. dollar could make it more difficult
    for us to repay our indebtedness.

We use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign
    currency fluctuations, but we cannot guarantee that our hedging
    strategies will be effective.

Failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse
    impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows

Significant
    changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions
    relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the
    valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension
    plans, and our pension cost.

Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan
    assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present
    value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is
    materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension
    obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those
    obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment
    performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets
    can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the
    valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in
    a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. A change
    in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or
    decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the
    reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net
    periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. Similarly,
    changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in
    significant changes in the net periodic pension cost for
    subsequent fiscal years.

CAG
    may be required to make payments to Hoechst.

Under its 1999 demerger agreement with Hoechst, CAG agreed to
    indemnify Hoechst for environmental liabilities that Hoechst may
    incur with respect to CAG’s German production sites, which
    were transferred from Hoechst to CAG in connection with the
    demerger. CAG also has an obligation to indemnify Hoechst
    against liabilities for environmental damages or contamination
    arising under certain divestiture agreements entered into by
    Hoechst prior to the demerger. As the indemnification
    obligations depend on the occurrence of unpredictable future
    events, the costs associated with them are not yet determinable
    and may materially affect operating results.

CAG’s obligation to indemnify Hoechst against liabilities
    for environmental contamination in connection with the
    divestiture agreements is subject to the following thresholds:

•

CAG will indemnify Hoechst for the total amount of these
    liabilities up to €250 million;

•

Hoechst will bear the full amount of those liabilities between
    €250 million and €750 million; and

•

CAG will indemnify Hoechst for one third of those liabilities
    for amounts exceeding €750 million.

CAG has made total cumulative payments through December 31,
    2006 of $44 million for environmental contamination
    liabilities in connection with the divestiture agreements, and
    may be required to make additional payments in the future. As of
    December 31, 2006, we have reserves of approximately
    $33 million for this contingency, and may be required to
    record additional reserves in the future.

Also, CAG has undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify
    Hoechst to the extent that Hoechst is required to discharge
    liabilities, including tax liabilities, in relation to assets
    included in the demerger, where such liabilities have not been
    demerged due to transfer or other restrictions. CAG did not make
    any payments to Hoechst during the year ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 or 2004 in connection with this indemnity.

Under the demerger agreement, CAG will also be responsible,
    directly or indirectly, for all of Hoechst’s obligations to
    past employees of businesses that were demerged to CAG. Under
    the demerger agreement, Hoechst agreed to indemnify CAG from
    liabilities (other than liabilities for environmental
    contamination) stemming from the agreements governing the
    divestiture of Hoechst’s polyester businesses, which were
    demerged to CAG, insofar as such liabilities relate to the
    European part of that business. Hoechst has also agreed to bear
    80% of the financial



obligations arising in connection with the government
    investigation and litigation associated with the sorbates
    industry for price fixing described in Note 25 to the
    consolidated financial statements, and CAG has agreed to bear
    the remaining 20%.

Our
    variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk,
    which could cause our debt service obligations to increase
    significantly and affect our operating results.

Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under the
    amended and restated senior credit facilities, are at variable
    rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If
    interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on
    our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the
    amount borrowed remained the same. As of December 31, 2006,
    we had approximately $1.9 billion of variable rate debt, of
    which $0.3 billion is hedged with an interest rate swap,
    which leaves us approximately $1.6 billion of variable rate
    debt subject to interest rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1%
    increase in interest rates would increase annual interest
    expense by approximately $16 million. There can be no
    assurance that interest rates will not rise significantly in the
    future. Such an increase could have an adverse impact on our
    future results of operations and cash flows.

The
    disposition by the Original Shareholders of at least 90% of
    their equity interest will satisfy a vesting condition under our
    deferred compensation plan.

In December 2004, we approved, among other incentive and
    retention programs, a deferred compensation plan for executive
    officers and key employees. The programs were intended to align
    management performance with the creation of shareholder value.
    The deferred compensation plan has an aggregate maximum amount
    payable of $196 million over five years ending in 2009. The
    initial component of the deferred compensation plan vested in
    2004 and was paid in the first quarter of 2005. The remaining
    aggregate maximum amount payable of $142 million is subject
    to downward adjustment if the price of our Series A common
    stock falls below the initial public offering price of
    $16 per share and vests subject to both (i) continued
    employment or the achievement of certain performance criteria
    and (2) the disposition by three of the four Original
    Shareholders of at least 90% of their equity interest in the
    Company with at least a 25% cash internal rate of return on
    their equity interest. The Original Shareholders have an equity
    interest of approximately 14.09%. Upon the occurrence of a
    qualifying sale, as defined, the amount vested and payable under
    the plan as of December 31, 2006 would be approximately
    $75 million, exclusive of $19 million accrued in 2006
    and payable in 2007 due to the accelerated vesting of certain
    plan participants.

Our
    future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Our inability to enforce these
    rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position
    and our profit margins.

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    product and process developments in our major markets. Patents
    may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product
    uses. Protection for individual products extends for varying
    periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing
    and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The
    protection afforded, which may also vary from country to
    country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of
    coverage. As patents expire, the products and processes
    described and claimed in those patents become generally
    available for use by the public. Our continued growth strategy
    may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property
    protection may be limited and difficult to enforce.

We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of
    protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names
    become more important once the corresponding patents have
    expired. If we are not successful in protecting our trademark or
    patent rights, our revenues, results of operations and cash
    flows may be adversely affected.



Provisions
    in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation
    and amended and restated bylaws, as well as any
    shareholders’ rights plan, may discourage a takeover
    attempt.

Provisions contained in our second amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more
    difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
    might be beneficial to our shareholders. Provisions of our
    second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which
    could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain
    corporate actions. For example, our second amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors
    to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and
    restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any
    vote or action by our shareholders. Thus, our board of directors
    can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or
    conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or
    other rights of holders of our Series A common stock. These
    rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of
    control of our company. In addition, a change of control of our
    company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having
    three classes of directors (each class elected for a three year
    term) or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that
    our board of directors may adopt. These provisions could limit
    the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the
    future for shares of our Series A common stock.

Risks
    Related to the Acquisition of CAG

The
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss
    transfer agreement (“Domination Agreement”) may be
    increased, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser can
    otherwise make available to us.

Several minority shareholders of CAG have initiated special
    award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts
    of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual
    payment offered under the Domination Agreement. On
    March 14, 2005, the Frankfurt District Court dismissed on
    grounds of inadmissibility the motions of all minority
    shareholders regarding the initiation of these special award
    proceedings. In January 2006, the Frankfurt Higher District
    Court ruled that the appeals were admissible, and the
    proceedings will therefore continue. On December 12, 2006,
    the Frankfurt District Court appointed an expert to help
    determine the value of CAG. As a result of these proceedings,
    the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment could be increased by the court, and the
    Purchaser would be required to make such payments within two
    months after the publication of the court’s ruling. Any
    such increase may be substantial. All minority shareholders
    including those who have already received the fair cash
    compensation would be entitled to claim the respective higher
    amounts. This may reduce the funds the Purchaser can make
    available to us and, accordingly, diminish our ability to make
    payments on our indebtedness. See Notes 2 and 25 to our
    consolidated financial statements for further information.

The
    Purchaser may be required to compensate CAG for annual losses,
    which may reduce the funds the Purchaser can otherwise make
    available to us.

Under the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser is required, among
    other things, to compensate CAG for any annual loss incurred,
    determined in accordance with German accounting requirements, by
    CAG at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was
    incurred. This obligation to compensate CAG for annual losses
    will apply during the entire term of the Domination Agreement.
    If CAG incurs losses during any period of the operative term of
    the Domination Agreement and if such losses lead to an annual
    loss of CAG at the end of any given fiscal year during the term
    of the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser will be obligated to
    make a corresponding cash payment to CAG to the extent that the
    respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the
    dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of CAG
    during the term of the Domination Agreement. The Purchaser may
    be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to CAG by off-setting
    against such loss compensation claims by CAG any valuable
    counterclaims against CAG that the Purchaser may have. If the
    Purchaser is obligated to make cash payments to CAG to cover an
    annual loss, we may not have sufficient funds to make payments
    on our indebtedness when due and, unless the Purchaser is able
    to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of CAG,
    the Purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund
    such shortfall. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements.



We and
    two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with
    respect to the Purchaser’s obligation under the Domination
    Agreement and intercompany indebtedness to CAG, which may
    diminish our ability to make payments on our
    indebtedness.

Our subsidiaries, Celanese Caylux and BCP Crystal, have each
    agreed to provide the Purchaser with financing so that the
    Purchaser is at all times in a position to completely meet its
    obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
    Agreement. In addition, Celanese has guaranteed (i) that
    the Purchaser will meet its obligation under the Domination
    Agreement to compensate CAG for any annual loss incurred by CAG
    during the term of the Domination Agreement; and (ii) the
    repayment of all existing intercompany indebtedness of
    Celanese’s subsidiaries to CAG. Further, under the terms of
    Celanese’s guarantee, in certain limited circumstances CAG
    may be entitled to require the immediate repayment of some or
    all of the intercompany indebtedness owed by Celanese’s
    subsidiaries to CAG. If Celanese, Celanese Caylux

and/or

BCP
    Crystal are obligated to make payments under their obligations
    to the Purchaser or CAG, as the case may be, or if the
    intercompany indebtedness owed to CAG is accelerated, we may not
    have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due
    or other expenditures.

The
    price paid by the Purchaser for the acquisition of the remaining
    outstanding CAG shares may be challenged in court.

The price could increase if the amount of fair cash compensation
    is successfully challenged in court. See Note 25 to our
    consolidated financial statements for further information.

Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness

Our
    high level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise
    additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to
    react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and
    prevent us from meeting obligations under our
    indebtedness.

We are highly leveraged. Our total indebtedness is approximately
    $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2006 (excluding
    $134 million of future accretion on the senior discount
    notes).

Our substantial debt could have important consequences,
    including:

•

making it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt;

•

increasing vulnerability to general economic and industry
    conditions;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our borrowings, primarily the borrowings under the amended
    and restated senior credit facilities, are at variable rates of
    interest;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service
    requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other
    purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who have less debt.

Despite
    our current high leverage, we and our subsidiaries may be able
    to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate
    the risks of our high leverage.

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in
    the future. The terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit
    us from doing so. If new debt, including amounts available under
    our amended and restated senior credit facilities, is added to
    our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face
    could intensify. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Liquidity — Contractual
    Obligations.”



We may
    not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our
    indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy
    obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be
    successful.

Our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand,
    receipt of additional capital, including possible additional
    borrowings, and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of
    distributions, advances or cash payments. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Liquidity — Contractual
    Obligations.”

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on the financial condition and
    operating performance of our subsidiaries, which is subject to
    prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain
    financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may
    not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
    activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
    premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or
    delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital
    or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such
    operating results and resources, we could face substantial
    liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material
    assets or operations to meet our debt service and other
    obligations. The amended and restated senior credit facilities
    and the indentures governing our indebtedness restrict our
    ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the
    disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions
    or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and
    these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service
    obligations then due.

Restrictive
    covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to
    engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to
    make payments on our indebtedness.

The amended and restated senior credit facilities and the
    indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants
    that limit our ability to engage in specified types of
    transactions. The covenants contained in the indentures limit
    the ability of Crystal LLC, BCP Crystal and their restricted
    subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional
    indebtedness or issue preferred stock, pay dividends on or make
    other distributions on or repurchase their capital stock or make
    other restricted payments, make investments, and sell certain
    assets.

In addition, the amended and restated senior credit facilities
    contain covenants that require Celanese Holdings to maintain
    specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition
    tests. Celanese Holdings’ ability to meet those financial
    ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond its control,
    and it may not be able to meet those tests at all. A breach of
    any of these covenants could result in a default under the
    amended and restated senior credit facilities. Upon the
    occurrence of an event of default under the amended and restated
    senior credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all
    amounts outstanding under the amended and restated senior credit
    facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all
    commitments to extend further credit. If Celanese Holdings were
    unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the amended and
    restated senior credit facilities could proceed against the
    collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Our
    subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as
    collateral under the amended and restated senior credit
    facilities. If the lenders under the amended and restated senior
    credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may
    not have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the
    amended and restated senior credit facilities as well as their
    other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect
    on the value of our stock.

The
    terms of our amended and restated senior credit facilities limit
    the ability of BCP Crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends
    or otherwise transfer their assets to us.

Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our
    ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the
    distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, the terms
    of our amended and restated senior credit facilities limit the
    ability of BCP Crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or
    otherwise transfer their assets to us. Accordingly, our ability
    to pay dividends on our stock is similarly limited.

    facilities in South Korea. Our Chemical Products segment has
    ventures with manufacturing facilities in Saudi Arabia and
    Germany and our Acetate Products segment has three ventures with
    production facilities in China.

We believe that our current facilities and those of our

Legal
    Proceedings

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and
    claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business,

    waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the
    environment. While it is impossible at this time to determine
    with certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims, we believe, based on the advice of legal
    counsel, that adequate provisions have been made and that the
    ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, but may have a material adverse effect on
    the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting
    period. See Note 25 (“commitments and

Holders

No shares of Celanese’s Series B common stock are
    issued and outstanding. As of February 12, 2007, there were
    118 holders of record of our Series A common stock, and one
    holder of record of our perpetual preferred stock. By including
    persons holding shares in broker accounts under street names,
    however, we estimate our shareholder base to be approximately
    46,300 as of February 12, 2007.

Dividend
    Policy

In July 2005, our board of directors adopted a policy of
    declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash
    dividend on each share of our Series A common stock at an
    annual rate of $0.16 per share unless our board of
    directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise.
    Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly dividends of
    $0.04 per share on February 1, 2006, May 1, 2006,
    August 1, 2006, November 1, 2006 and February 1,
    2007. Based on the number of outstanding shares of our
    Series A common stock, the anticipated annual cash dividend
    is approximately $26 million. However, there is no
    assurance that sufficient cash will be available in the future
    to pay such dividend. Further, such dividends payable to holders
    of our Series A common stock cannot be declared or paid nor
    can any funds be set aside for the payment thereof, unless we
    have paid or set aside funds for the payment of all accumulated
    and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of our preferred
    stock, as described below.

Our board of directors may, at any time, modify or revoke our
    dividend policy on our Series A common stock.

We are required under the terms of the preferred stock to pay
    scheduled quarterly dividends, subject to legally available
    funds. For so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding,
    (1) we will not declare, pay or set apart funds for the
    payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to
    any junior stock or parity stock and (2) neither we, nor
    any of our subsidiaries, will, subject to certain exceptions,
    redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration junior
    stock or parity stock through a sinking fund or otherwise, in
    each case unless we have paid or set apart funds for the payment
    of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the
    shares of preferred stock and any parity stock for all preceding
    dividend periods. Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly
    dividends of $0.265625 on our 4.25% convertible perpetual
    preferred stock on February 1, 2006, May 1, 2006,
    August 1, 2006, November 1, 2006 and February 1,
    2007. The anticipated annual cash dividend is approximately
    $10 million.



The amount available to us to pay cash dividends is restricted
    by our subsidiaries’ debt agreements. The indentures
    governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount
    notes also limit, but do not prohibit, the ability of BCP
    Crystal, Crystal LLC and their respective subsidiaries to pay
    dividends. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the
    future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors
    and will depend on, among other things, our results of
    operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual
    restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may
    deem relevant.

Under Delaware law, our board of directors may declare dividends
    only to the extent of our “surplus” (which is defined
    as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities,
    minus statutory capital), or if there is no surplus, out of our
    net profits for the then current

and/or

immediately preceding fiscal years. The value of a
    corporation’s assets can be measured in a number of ways
    and may not necessarily equal their book value. The value of our
    capital may be adjusted from time to time by our board of
    directors but in no event will be less than the aggregate par
    value of our issued stock. Our board of directors may base this
    determination on our financial statements, a fair valuation of
    our assets or another reasonable method. Our board of directors
    will seek to assure itself that the statutory requirements will
    be met before actually declaring dividends. In future periods,
    our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation
    firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient
    to allow payment of dividends, and such opinions may not be
    forthcoming. If we sought and were not able to obtain such an
    opinion, we likely would not be able to pay dividends. In
    addition, pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are
    prohibited from paying a dividend on our Series A common
    stock unless all payments due and payable under the preferred
    stock have been made.

In the nine months ended December 31, 2004, CAG declared
    and paid a dividend of €0.12 ($0.14) per share for the year
    ended December 31, 2003. Dividends paid to Celanese and its
    consolidated subsidiaries eliminate in consolidation.

During 2006, we declared and paid dividends to holders of our
    Series A common shares of $26 million, or
    $0.04 per share per quarter. During 2005, we declared and
    paid dividends to holders of our Series A common shares of
    $13 million, or $0.04 per share per quarter.



Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis

of Financial Condition and Results
    of Operations

In this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the term “Celanese” refers to Celanese Corporation, a
    Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the
    “Company,” “we,” “our,”
    “us,” and Successor refer to Celanese and its
    subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term “BCP
    Crystal” refers to our subsidiary, BCP Crystal US Holdings
    Corp., a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The
    term “Purchaser” refers to our subsidiary, Celanese
    Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known as BCP
    Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG, a German limited
    partnership, and not its subsidiaries, except where otherwise
    indicated. The term “Original Shareholders” refers,
    collectively, to Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman)
    Ltd. 1, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 2,
    Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 3 and BA Capital
    Investors Sidecar Fund, L.P. The terms “Sponsor” and
    “Advisor” refer to certain affiliates of The
    Blackstone Group.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of the
    financial condition and the results of operations together with
    the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes
    to consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (“U.S. GAAP”).

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition
    and results of operations covers periods prior and subsequent to
    the acquisition of CAG and its subsidiaries (collectively
    “CAG” or the “Predecessor”). Accordingly,
    the discussion and analysis of historical periods prior to the
    acquisition do not reflect the significant impact that the
    acquisition of CAG has had and will have on the Successor,
    including increased leverage and liquidity requirements as well
    as purchase accounting adjustments. Furthermore, the Successor
    and the Predecessor have different accounting policies with
    respect to certain matters (see Note 4 to the notes to
    consolidated financial statements). Investors are cautioned that
    the forward-looking statements contained in this section involve
    both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by
    these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in
    nature and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See
    “Forward-Looking Information” located below.

The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2005
    and the three months ended March 31, 2005 have not been
    audited and should not be taken as an indication of the results
    of operations to be reported for any subsequent period or for
    the full fiscal year.

Reconciliation of

Non-U.S. GAAP Measures:

We believe that using

non-U.S. GAAP

financial measures to supplement U.S. GAAP results is
    useful to investors because such use provides a more complete
    understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business
    other than disclosing U.S. GAAP results alone. In this
    regard, we disclose net debt, which is a

non-U.S. GAAP

financial measure. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash
    and cash equivalents. We use net debt to evaluate the capital
    structure. Net debt is not a substitute for any U.S. GAAP
    financial measure. In addition, calculations of net debt
    contained in this report may not be consistent with that of
    other companies. The most directly comparable financial measure
    presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in our financial
    statements for net debt is total debt. For a reconciliation of
    net debt to total debt, see “Financial Highlights”
    below. For a reconciliation of trade working capital to working
    capital components, see “Selected Financial Data.”

Forward-Looking
    Statements May Prove Inaccurate

This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements
    and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of
    our management as well as assumptions made by, and information
    currently available to, us. These statements include, but are
    not limited to, statements about our strategies, plans,
    objectives, expectations, intentions, expenditures, and
    assumptions and other statements contained in this Annual Report
    that are not historical facts. When used in this document, words
    such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    ”estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
    “plan” and “project” and similar
    expressions, as they relate to us are intended to identify
    forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current
    views with respect to future events, are not guarantees of
    future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are
    difficult to predict. Further, certain forward-looking
    statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that
    may not prove to be accurate.

See the Risk Factors section under Part 1, Item 1A for a
    description of risk factors that could significantly affect our
    financial results. In addition, the following factors could
    cause our actual results to differ materially from those



results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors
    include, among other things:

•

changes in general economic, business, political and regulatory
    conditions in the countries or regions in which we operate;

•

the length and depth of product and industry business cycles
    particularly in the automotive, electrical, electronics and
    construction industries;

•

changes in the price and availability of raw materials,
    particularly changes in the demand for, supply of, and market
    prices of fuel oil, natural gas, coal, electricity and
    petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene and butane, including
    changes in production quotas in OPEC countries and the
    deregulation of the natural gas transmission industry in Europe;

•

the ability to pass increases in raw material prices on to
    customers or otherwise improve margins through price increases;

•

the ability to maintain plant utilization rates and to implement
    planned capacity additions and expansions;

•

the ability to reduce production costs and improve productivity
    by implementing technological improvements to existing plants;

•

increased price competition and the introduction of competing
    products by other companies;

•

changes in the degree of patent and other legal protection
    afforded to our products;

•

compliance costs and potential disruption or interruption of
    production due to accidents or other unforeseen events or delays
    in construction of facilities;

•

potential liability for remedial actions under existing or
    future environmental regulations;

•

potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation,
    or from changes in the laws, regulations or policies of
    governments or other governmental activities in the countries in
    which we operate;

•

changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates;

•

pending or future challenges to the domination and profit and
    loss transfer agreement (“Domination
    Agreement”); and

•

various other factors, both referenced and not referenced in
    this document.

Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are,
    therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks
    or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions
    prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements
    may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report
    as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned
    or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to
    update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
    their dates.

Basis of
    Presentation

The Successor period represents our audited consolidated
    financial position as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and our
    audited consolidated results of operations and cash flows for
    the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine
    months ended December 31, 2004 and its unaudited interim
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005 and the three months ended
    March 31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements
    reflect the application of purchase accounting relating to the
    original acquisition of CAG and purchase price accounting
    adjustments relating to the acquisitions of Vinamul, Acetex and
    additional CAG shares acquired during the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

The Predecessor period represents CAG’s audited interim
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three
    months ended March 31, 2004. These consolidated financial
    statements relate to periods prior to the acquisition of CAG and
    present CAG’s historical basis of accounting without the
    application of purchase accounting.



The results of the Successor are not comparable to the results
    of the Predecessor due to the difference in the basis of
    presentation of purchase accounting as compared to historical
    cost. Furthermore, the Successor and the Predecessor have
    different accounting policies with respect to certain matters.

Change in
    Ownership and Initial Public Offering

Pursuant to a voluntary tender offer commenced in February 2004,
    the Purchaser, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Celanese
    Corporation, on April 6, 2004, acquired approximately 84%
    of the ordinary shares of Celanese AG, excluding treasury
    shares, for a purchase price of $1,693 million, including
    direct acquisition costs of $69 million (the
    “Acquisition”). During the year ended
    December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004, the Purchaser acquired additional CAG
    shares for $473 million and $33 million, respectively,
    including direct acquisition costs of $4 million and less
    than $1 million, respectively. As of December 31,
    2006, our ownership percentage in CAG was approximately 98%. As
    a result of the effective registration of the Squeeze-Out (as
    defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements)
    in the commercial register in December 2006, we acquired the
    remaining 2% of CAG in January 2007.

On November 3, 2004, Blackstone Crystal Holdings Capital
    Partners (Cayman) IV Ltd., reorganized as a Delaware corporation
    and changed its name to Celanese Corporation. Additionally, BCP
    Crystal Holdings Ltd. 2, a subsidiary of Celanese Corporation,
    was reorganized as a Delaware limited liability company and
    changed its name to Celanese Holdings LLC.

In January 2005, we completed an initial public offering of
    50,000,000 shares of Series A common stock and
    received net proceeds of $752 million after deducting
    underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses of
    $48 million. Concurrently, we received net proceeds of
    $233 million from the offering of our convertible perpetual
    preferred stock. A portion of the proceeds of the share
    offerings were used to redeem $188 million of our senior
    discount notes and $521 million of our senior subordinated
    notes, excluding early redemption premiums of $19 million
    and $51 million, respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Overview

We are an integrated global hybrid producer of value-added
    industrial chemicals. We are the world’s largest producer
    of acetyl products, including acetic acid and vinyl acetate
    monomer (“VAM”), polyacetal products
    (“POM”), as well as a leading global producer of
    high-performance engineered polymers used in consumer and
    industrial products and designed to meet highly technical
    customer requirements. We believe that approximately 95% of our
    differentiated intermediate and specialty products hold first or
    second market positions globally. Our operations are located
    primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. We believe we are
    one of the lowest-cost producers of key building block chemicals
    in the acetyls chain, such as acetic acid and VAM, due to our
    economies of scale, operating and purchasing efficiencies and
    proprietary production technologies. In addition, we have a
    significant portfolio of strategic investments, including a
    number of ventures in North America, Europe and Asia.
    Collectively, these strategic investments create value for the
    Company and contribute significantly to sales, earnings and cash
    flow. These investments play an integral role in our strategy
    for growth and expansion of our global reach. We have entered
    into these strategic investments in order to gain access to
    local markets, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we
    believe have significant future business potential.

We operate principally through four business segments: Chemical
    Products, Technical Polymers Ticona (“Ticona”),
    Acetate Products and Performance Products. For further detail on
    the business segments, see below “Summary by Business
    Segment” in the “Results of Operations” section
    of MD&A.

Sale of
    Oxo Products and Derivatives businesses

On December 13, 2006, we signed a definitive agreement to
    sell our oxo products and derivatives businesses, including
    European Oxo GmbH (“EOXO”), a joint venture between
    CAG and Degussa AG (“Degussa”), to Advent
    International, for a purchase price of €480 million
    subject to final agreement adjustments and successful exercise
    of our option to purchase Degussa’s interest. We anticipate
    the sale to be completed in the first quarter of 2007. During
    the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded approximately
    $8 million of expense to Gain (loss) on disposition of
    assets, net for incremental costs associated with this pending
    divestiture.



Relocation
    of Ticona Plant in Kelsterbach

On November 29, 2006, we reached a settlement with the
    Frankfurt, Germany, Airport (“Fraport”) to relocate
    our Kelsterbach, Germany, business, resolving several years of
    legal disputes related to the planned Frankfurt airport
    expansion. As a result of the settlement, we will transition our
    administration and operations from Kelsterbach to another
    location in Germany by mid-2011. Over a five-year period,
    Fraport will pay us a total of €650 million to offset
    the costs associated with the transition of the business from
    its current location and the closure of the Kelsterbach plant.
    As of December 31, 2006, Fraport has paid us a total of
    €20 million ($26 million) towards the transition.
    The amount has been accounted for as deferred income, is
    included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet
    as of December 31, 2006 and is reflected as an investing
    activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

Financial
    Reporting Changes

See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for
    information regarding financial reporting changes and recent
    accounting pronouncements.

Major
    Events In 2006

•

As noted above, in December 2006, we reached a settlement with
    Fraport related to the planned Frankfurt airport expansion.

•

As noted above, in December 2006, we signed a definitive
    agreement to sell our oxo products and derivative businesses,
    including EOXO, a joint venture between CAG and Degussa, to
    Advent International.

•

In December 2006, we sold our preferred interest in Pemeas GmbH
    to BASF and received net proceeds from the sale of
    €9 million and recognized a gain of
    €8 million.

•

The Squeeze-Out (as defined in Note 2 to the consolidated
    financial statements) was approved by the affirmative vote of
    the majority of the votes cast at CAG’s annual general
    meeting in May 2006. As a result of the effective registration
    of the Squeeze-Out in the commercial register in December 2006,
    we acquired the remaining 2% of CAG in January 2007.

•

Announced plans to relocate the strategic management of the
    Acetyls business to Shanghai, China, in 2007.

•

As a result of the Sponsor’s sale of 65,000,000 shares
    of our Series A common stock in 2006, affiliates of the
    Sponsor control less than a majority of the voting power of our
    outstanding Series A common stock. As a result, we are no
    longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of
    the New York Stock Exchange rules and, thus, are required to
    have a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent
    directors and nominating and compensation committees composed
    entirely of independent directors. However, we will phase in
    these corporate governance requirements prior to May 15,
    2007.

•

In August 2006, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase the
    cellulose acetate flake, tow and film business of Acetate
    Products Limited for a purchase price of approximately
    £57 million ($110 million), subject to certain
    adjustments as defined in the agreement. The transaction closed
    on January 31, 2007. See Note 32 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

•

In August 2006, we entered into an agreement with Degussa
    pursuant to which Degussa granted us an option to purchase
    Degussa’s interest in our EOXO venture. The option is
    exercisable until June 30, 2007 and is subject to certain
    conditions. In connection with the sale of our oxo products and
    derivatives businesses noted above, we anticipate giving notice
    to Degussa that we will exercise the option, subject to certain
    conditions, to purchase their 50% interest, which will be
    subsequently sold to Advent International. See Notes 6 and
    32 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
    information.

•

We shut down our Pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations
    during the third quarter of 2006.

•

In July 2006, we made a $100 million equivalent voluntary
    prepayment on our senior term loan facility. In connection with
    the voluntary prepayment, we wrote off approximately
    $1 million of unamortized deferred financing fees
    associated with the senior term loan facility.



Major
    Events In 2005

•

In December 2005, we reached settlements with two insurers of
    CNA Holdings pursuant to which CNA Holdings will be paid a total
    of $16 million in the next two years ($7 million in
    2006 and $9 million in 2007) in exchange for the
    release of certain claims against the policy of the insurer. We
    recorded approximately $30 million in income to other
    (charges) gains, net for two plumbing action insurance
    settlements in the fourth quarter of 2005.

•

In December 2005, we resolved litigation pertaining to antitrust
    claims filed against certain shipping companies. Pursuant to
    these agreements, we received net proceeds of approximately
    $36 million which was recorded as a reduction to cost of
    sales in the fourth quarter of 2005.

•

In December 2005, we announced a plan to develop our Nanjing,
    China site into an integrated chemical complex that will include
    a 600,000 metric ton acetic acid plant, a vinyl acetate unit and
    a vinyl acetate emulsions unit. Startup is targeted for the
    first half of 2007.

•

In December 2005, we sold our Cyclo-olefine Copolymer business
    (“COC”) to a venture of Japan’s Daicel Chemical
    Industries Ltd. (“Daicel”) and Polyplastics Co, Ltd.
    (”Polyplastics”). Daicel holds a majority stake in the
    venture with 55% interest and Polyplastics, which itself is a
    venture between us and Daicel, owns the remaining 45%. The
    transaction resulted in a loss of approximately $35 million.

•

In December 2005, we completed the sale of our common stock
    interest in the Pemeas GmbH fuel cell venture and recognized a
    gain of less than $1 million.

•

In December 2005, we announced that discussions regarding the
    venture project being developed by Acetex and Tasnee
    Petrochemicals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have been
    temporarily suspended due to the current high demand on
    contractors and vendors which have affected expected project
    costs.

•

In December 2005, we announced our intention to pursue strategic
    alternatives for our Pampa, Texas plant. The facility, which
    produces a variety of products based on butane, including
    290,000 metric tons of acetic acid, faces competitive pressures
    due to the technology utilized.

•

Increased our ownership of CAG to approximately 98% as of
    November 2, 2005 following an agreement with major
    shareholders and ongoing tender offers. In November 2005, our
    Board of Directors granted approval to effect a Squeeze-Out of
    the remaining minority shareholders of CAG. See Note 2 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we exited our filament business
    (See Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial
    statements).

In October 2005, we completed the sale of our acetate
    manufacturing facility in Rock Hill, South Carolina to Greens of
    Rock Hill LLC. Production at the facility was phased out earlier
    in 2005 as part of our previously announced plans to consolidate
    our acetate flake manufacturing operations. We recognized a gain
    on sale of approximately $23 million, which includes the
    reversal of $12 million of asset retirement obligations and
    $7 million of environmental reserves, as the purchaser
    assumed these obligations.

•

In August 2005, our board adopted a dividend policy and we began
    to pay common shareholders a dividend of $0.16 per share
    annually, or 1%, based on the initial public offering price of
    $16 per share.

•

In July 2005, we completed the acquisition of Acetex Corporation
    for $270 million and assumed Acetex’s
    $247 million of debt, which is net of cash acquired of
    $54 million. We also redeemed Acetex’s outstanding


/

Continued to focus the product portfolio by exiting
    non-strategic businesses, such as the high performance polymer
    polybenzamidazole (“PBI”), vectran polymer and
    emulsion powders.

•

In February 2005, we completed the acquisition of Vinamul, the
    North American and European emulsion polymer business of
    Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (“ICI”) for
    $208 million. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

•

In January 2005, we completed an initial public offering of
    50,000,000 shares of Series A common stock.
    Concurrently, we issued 9,600,000 shares of convertible
    perpetual preferred stock. See Note 3 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

Major
    Events In 2004

•

    project was completed in October 2004.

•

In October 2004, we completed an organizational restructuring.
    See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

•

In October 2004, we announced plans to implement a strategic
    restructuring of our acetate business to increase efficiency,
    reduce overcapacity in certain areas and to focus on products
    and markets that provide long-term value. The restructuring
    resulted in $50 million of asset impairment charges
    recorded as an other (charge) gain, net and $12 million in
    charges to depreciation for related asset retirement obligations
    for the nine months ended December 31, 2004.

Summary
    of Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31,
    2006 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net
    Sales

For the year ended December 31, 2006, net sales increased
    by 10.3% to $6,656 million compared to the same period in
    2005. An increase in pricing of 4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 driven by continued strong demand for the
    majority of our products and higher raw material and energy
    costs contributed to the improvement in net sales. Also, an
    increase in overall volumes of 1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, driven by our Ticona and Performance
    Products business segments, contributed to the increase in net
    sales. The volume increases are the results of increased market
    penetration from several of Ticona’s key products, an
    improved business environment in Europe, continued growth in
    Asia and continued growth in new and existing applications from
    our
    Sunett

®

sweetener. Additionally, net sales from Acetex of
    $542 million contributed to the increase in net sales for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to
    $247 million of net sales from Acetex for the same period
    in 2005. The Acetex business was acquired in July 2005.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained flat for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 (21.7%) compared to the same
    period in 2005 (21.6%). Overall higher raw material and energy
    costs were mostly offset by higher volumes and pricing. Volumes
    increased for such products as acetyls, acetyl derivative
    products, POM, Vectra and GUR while overall pricing increased,
    driven by increases in acetyls and acetyl derivative products.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $27 million to $538 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period last year.
    The increase consists of stock-based compensation expense of
    $20 million resulting from our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) and $14 million related to our
    long-term incentive plan. Additionally, the year ended
    December 31, 2006 included additional selling, general and
    administrative expenses from the Acetex business, which was
    acquired in July 2005, as well as costs related to executive
    severance and legal costs associated with the Squeeze-Out of CAG
    shareholders of $23 million. These expenses were mostly
    offset by ongoing cost savings initiatives from the Ticona and
    Acetate Products segments and lower costs from the divestiture
    of the COC business.

Other
    (Charges) Gains, Net

The components of other (charges) gains, net for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

(66

)

Other (charges) gains, net for the year ended December 31,
    2006 decreased $56 million compared to the same period in
    2005. The decrease is due to the absence of environmental
    related plant closures of $12 million, the



absence of asset impairment charges of $25 million related
    to the divestiture of our COC business and the absence of
    $35 million related to the termination of advisor
    monitoring services, all of which were recorded in 2005.

Operating
    Profit

Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2006
    increased 30.3% compared to the same period last year. This is
    principally driven by higher overall volumes and pricing, lower
    other (charges) gains, net and productivity improvements. Also,
    the year ended December 31, 2006 included operating profit
    from Acetex of $5 million, an increase of $8 million
    compared to the same period in 2005.

Equity
    in Net Earnings of Affiliates

Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 41% in the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period last
    year. The increase was primarily due to additional income of
    $8 million from the Infraserv affiliates, $4 million
    from our Ticona affiliates as well as the absence of a
    $10 million loss from Estech GmbH, recorded in 2005.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense decreased to $294 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $387 million in the same
    period last year. The decrease is primarily due to the absence
    of $28 million related to accelerated amortization of
    deferred financing costs and $74 million related to early
    redemption premiums associated with the partial redemption of
    the senior subordinated notes, senior discount notes and
    floating rate term loan, both recorded in 2005.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense increased by $192 million to
    $253 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and
    the effective tax rate for this period was 38%, slightly higher
    than the combined federal and state statutory rate of 37%. The
    effective tax rate was favorably impacted by unrepatriated low
    taxed earnings, primarily in Singapore. The effective tax rate
    was unfavorably affected by (1) dividends and other passive
    income inclusions from foreign subsidiaries and equity
    investments, and (2) higher tax rates in certain foreign
    jurisdictions, primarily Germany. The effective rate reflects a
    partial benefit for the reversal of valuation allowance on
    earnings in the U.S. of $5 million.  Reversals of valuation
    allowance established at the Acquisition resulting from positive
    earnings or a change in judgment regarding the realizability of
    the net deferred tax asset are primarily reflected as a
    reduction of goodwill, which amounted to $84 million in
    2006.

Earnings
    (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations primarily relates
    to Acetate Products’ filament operations, which were
    discontinued during the fourth quarter of 2005, and Chemical
    Products’ Pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations,
    which were discontinued during the third quarter of 2006. As a
    result, revenues and expenses related to the filament and PE
    operations are reflected as a component of discontinued
    operations.

Summary
    of Consolidated Results for the Three Months Ended
    March 31, 2005 and the Nine Months Ended December 31,
    2005 compared with the Three Months Ended March 31, 2004
    and the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2004

Net
    Sales

Net sales increased 22.8% to $4,564 million in the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period
    in 2004. The improvement is primarily due to an 11% increase in
    net sales from the Vinamul and Acetex acquisitions and 11%
    higher pricing, mainly in the Chemical Products segment. Net
    sales from Vinamul and Acetex (including AT Plastics) were
    approximately $280 million and approximately
    $247 million, respectively. These increases are partially
    offset by a 1% decline in volumes primarily from the Chemical
    Products’ acetyl derivatives business line and a decline in
    Ticona’s polyacetal volumes, partially offset by improved
    volumes from



Acetate Products and Performance Products. For Chemical
    Products, this is primarily due to weaker European market
    conditions. The decline for Ticona is due to a weak European
    automotive market and reduced sales to lower-end applications.
    Acetate Products volumes improved 7% due to higher flake sales
    to our recently expanded China tow ventures, which were
    partially offset by lower tow volumes due to the shutdown of the
    Canadian tow plant. Volumes from Performance Products improved
    primarily for the
    Sunett

®

sweetener and sorbates due to continued growth from new and
    existing applications mainly in the U.S. and European beverage
    and confectionary markets.

Net sales rose 21.5% to $1,469 million in the first quarter
    of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 primarily on higher
    pricing of 15%, mainly in the Chemical Products segment.
    Favorable currency movements, higher volumes, and a composition
    change in the Chemical Products segment each increased net sales
    by 2%.

The segment composition changes consisted of the acquisition of
    Vinamul in February 2005, which was partly offset by the effects
    of a contract manufacturing arrangement under which certain
    acrylates products are now being sold. Only the margin realized
    under the contract manufacturing arrangement is included in net
    sales.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit increased to 20.4% of net sales for the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005 from 19.3% of net sales for the
    same period in 2004. Gross profit increased to 25.3% of net
    sales for the three months ended March 31, 2005 from 19.4%
    of net sales for the same period in 2004. The increases are
    primarily due to higher overall pricing, mainly in the Chemical
    Products segment, offsetting higher raw material and energy
    costs, mainly from natural gas and ethylene. The increase during
    the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
    same period in 2004 was also due to the additional gross profit
    of $26 million and $24 million from Vinamul and Acetex
    (including AT Plastics), respectively.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
    $91 million to $363 million in the nine months ended
    December 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. This
    decrease is due to ongoing cost savings initiatives,
    organizational redesign of the Ticona and Acetate Products
    segments, and decreases in legal, audit and general expenses
    associated with the acquisition of CAG and the IPO. In addition,
    2004 included approximately $50 million in new management
    incentive compensation expenses, which includes charges for a
    new deferred compensation plan, a new stock incentive plan and
    other executive bonuses. These decreases are partially offset by
    the addition of costs associated with Vinamul and Acetex of
    $23 million and $22 million, respectively, which
    included integration costs incurred in connection with the
    acquisitions.

Selling, general and administrative expense increased to
    $148 million in the three months ended March 31, 2005
    compared to $136 million for the same period in 2004. This
    increase is primarily due to expenses for sponsor monitoring
    services of $10 million as well as higher costs primarily
    related to compliance with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.



Other
    (Charges) Gains, Net

The components of other (charges) gains, net for the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the three months ended

Other (charges) gains, net decreased to $28 million
    compared to $82 million for the same period in 2004. The
    nine months ended December 31, 2005 primarily relates to
    charges for a change in the environmental remediation strategy
    related to the closure of the Edmonton methanol plant, severance
    associated with the same closure, severance related to the
    relocation of corporate offices and asset impairments associated
    with the planned disposal of the COC business of
    $12 million, $8 million, $10 million and
    $25 million, respectively. In addition, 2005 includes
    $34 million associated with plumbing insurance recoveries.
    Other (charges) gains, net for the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 of $82 million were largely related
    to restructuring charges of $43 million resulting from
    plans by the Acetate Products segment to consolidate tow
    production at fewer sites and to discontinue production of
    acetate filament and $32 million related to a decision to
    dispose of the Ticona COC business.

Other (charges) gains, net increased $10 million for the
    three months ended March 31, 2005 compared to the same
    period in 2004. The charge for the three months ended
    March 31, 2005 relates to fees paid to the Advisor to
    terminate the monitoring services and all obligations to pay
    future monitoring fees under the transaction and monitoring fee
    agreement. The three months ended March 31, 2004 primarily
    relates to $26 million for advisory services related to the
    acquisition of CAG.

Operating
    Profit

Operating profit increased to $417 million in the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $72 million
    in the same period in 2004, principally driven by higher pricing
    and productivity improvements resulting in a $212 million
    increase in the gross profit margin, $91 million of lower
    selling, general and administrative expenses and
    $54 million of lower other (charges) gains, net. Partially
    offsetting the increase is an $11 million loss on
    disposition of assets compared to a $3 million gain
    recorded in the same period in 2004 and higher raw material and
    energy costs, mainly for ethylene and natural gas in 2005.
    Included in 2005 is a $23 million gain on the disposition
    of two Acetate Products properties, a $5 million gain on
    the sale of Performance Products’ omega-3 DHA business,
    offset by a $35 million loss on the disposal of
    Ticona’s COC business and $2 million of other losses.
    For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, Vinamul and
    Acetex (including AT Plastics), had operating losses of
    $15 million and $4 million, respectively, primarily
    related to integration costs in connection with the acquisitions
    and inventory purchase accounting adjustments for Acetex.

Operating profit increased to $156 million for the three
    months ended March 31, 2005 compared to $46 million in
    the same period in 2004 on gross margin expansion of
    $138 million, as significantly higher pricing, primarily in
    Chemical Products, lower depreciation expense and productivity
    improvements more than offset higher raw material and energy
    costs. Operating profit also benefited from increased volumes in
    Acetate Products,



Performance Products and Ticona. Depreciation and amortization
    expense declined by $9 million as decreases in depreciation
    resulting from purchase accounting adjustments, more than offset
    increased amortization expense for acquired intangible assets.

Equity
    in Net Earnings of Affiliates

Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased by
    $10 million to $46 million for the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. The
    increase is primarily due to restructuring charges in our
    European oxo venture in 2004. During the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005, we received cash distributions from our
    equity affiliates of $29 million compared to
    $22 million in the same period in 2004.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates rose by $3 million to
    $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005,
    compared to the same period in 2004. Cash distributions received
    from equity affiliates increased to $36 million for the
    three months ended March 31, 2005, compared to
    $16 million in the same period in 2004. The increase in
    cash distributions is mainly due to strong business conditions
    in 2004 for Ticona’s high performance product ventures and
    Chemical Products’ methanol venture and the timing of
    dividend payments.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense decreased $89 million to $211 million
    for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to
    $300 million in the same period in 2004. The decrease in
    interest expense is due to expensing deferred financing costs of
    $89 million and a prepayment premium of $21 million
    associated with the refinancing of the mandatorily redeemable
    preferred stock in 2004. The decrease was offset by a
    $21 million increase in interest expense due to higher debt
    levels and interest rates in 2005.

Interest expense increased to $176 million for the three
    months ended March 31, 2005 from $6 million in the
    same period in 2004, primarily due to expenses of
    $102 million including early redemption premiums and
    deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing that
    occurred in the first quarter of 2005. Higher debt levels
    resulting primarily from the acquisition of CAG and higher
    interest rates also increased interest expense.

Other
    Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net increased to income of
    $86 million for the nine months ended December 31,
    2005, compared to expense of $12 million for the comparable
    period in 2004. This increase is largely due to $42 million
    in higher dividend income in 2005 primarily from our Saudi cost
    investment due to higher methanol pricing. In addition,
    $36 million of the increase is related to favorable
    exchange rate movements and $17 million is due to favorable
    changes in cross currency swap valuations in 2005.

Other income (expense), net decreased to $3 million of
    income for the three months ended March 31, 2005, compared
    to $9 million for the comparable period in 2004. This
    decrease is primarily due to expenses associated with the
    anticipated guaranteed payment to CAG minority shareholders and
    the ineffective portion of a net investment hedge. These
    decreases were partially offset by higher dividends from cost
    investments. Dividend income accounted for under the cost method
    increased by $8 million to $14 million for the three
    months ended March 31, 2005, compared to the same period in
    2004. The increase in the first quarter of 2005 primarily
    resulted from the timing of receipt of dividends.

Income
    Taxes

For the year ending December 31, 2005, the annual effective
    tax rate was 16%, which is less than the combination of the
    federal statutory rate and blended state income tax rates in the
    U.S. The annual effective tax rate for 2005 reflects earnings in
    low tax jurisdictions, a valuation allowance on the tax benefit
    associated with U.S. and other foreign losses, tax expense in
    certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and reversal of a
    $31 million valuation allowance on certain German deferred
    tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards,
    principally as a result of a tax sharing agreement. For the
    nine months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded tax
    expense of $53 million and the effective rate was 15%. For
    the nine months ended December 31, 2004, we recorded
    tax expense of $70 million and the effective tax rate was
    negative 39%. The effective tax rate in 2004 was unfavorably
    affected primarily by the



application of full valuation allowances against
    post-Acquisition net U.S. deferred tax assets, Canadian deferred
    tax assets due to post-acquisition restructuring, certain German
    deferred tax assets and the non-recognition of tax benefits
    associated with acquisition related expenses. These unfavorable
    effects were partially offset by unrepatriated low taxed
    earnings primarily in Singapore.

Income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2005
    and 2004, are recorded based on the annual effective tax rate.
    As of March 31, 2005, the annual effective tax rate for
    2005 was 35%, which was slightly less than the combination of
    the statutory rate and state income tax rates in the U.S. The
    estimated annual effective tax rate for 2005 reflects earnings
    in low tax jurisdictions, a valuation allowance for the tax
    benefit associated with projected U.S. losses (which includes
    expenses associated with the early redemption of debt), and tax
    expense in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Predecessor had
    an effective tax rate of 24% for the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, compared to the German statutory rate of
    40%, which was primarily affected by earnings in low tax
    jurisdictions.

Earnings
    (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations primarily relates
    to Acetate Products’ filament operations and Chemical
    Products’ Pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations and
    acrylates business. As a result, the related revenues and
    expenses have been reflected as a component of discontinued
    operations.

Chemical Products’ net sales increased 10% to
    $4,742 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005. Pricing increased for most
    products driven primarily by the Acetyl, Acetyl Derivatives and
    Specialty business lines. Higher pricing was a result of
    continued strong demand for the majority of the products and
    higher raw material costs. Overall volumes increased 1% for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in
    2005 primarily due to increased demand in Asia. Net sales also
    increased due to $307 million of net sales from Acetex
    (excluding AT Plastics), which was acquired in July 2005, an
    increase of $172 million compared to the same period in
    2005.

Operating profit increased 9% to $637 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005
    as price increases and lower other (charges) gains, net more
    than offset raw material price increases. The lower other
    (charges) gains, net was due to the absence of $6 million
    of severance costs associated with the closure of the Edmonton
    Methanol plant and $5 million of environmental relates
    plant closure costs, both recorded in 2005.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 6% to $709 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. The
    improvement is primarily due to the increases in operating
    profit. Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased
    $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005.

Ticona’s net sales increased 3% to $915 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same
    period in 2005. The increase for the year was primarily driven
    by 6% higher volumes. Volumes increased in all product lines due
    to increased market penetration and a stronger business
    environment in Europe. Improved volumes during 2006 were
    partially offset by the absence of net sales from the COC
    business, which was divested in December 2005. During the year
    ended December 31, 2005, COC recorded approximately
    $19 million in net sales.

Operating profit increased to $145 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to $60 million for
    the same period in 2005 as improved net sales more than offset
    higher raw material and energy costs. Also contributing to the
    increases are positive effects from the exit of the COC business
    (including a reduction in other charges due to the 2005 asset
    impairment charge of $25 million), productivity
    improvements and lower spending due to an organizational
    redesign. During the year ended December 31, 2005, COC
    recorded an operating loss of $69 million, including asset
    impairments mentioned above.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 73% to $201 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. This
    increase is primarily due to the increases in operating profit.
    Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased $4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same
    period in 2005.

Acetate Products’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 increased 6% to $700 million
    compared to the same period in 2005 as higher prices and
    increased flake volumes more than offset lower tow volumes. The
    lower tow volumes, which were a result of shutting down our
    Canadian tow plant, and lower sales to China, which were due to
    the recent expansion of our China tow ventures were partially
    offset by an increase in flake sales to other third parties and
    venture partners.

Operating profit increased to $106 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to operating income of
    $67 million in the same period in 2005. Higher pricing of
    7%, savings from restructuring and lower other (charges) gain,
    net and manufacturing costs more than offset lower overall sales
    volumes and higher raw material and energy costs. The lower
    other (charges) gains, net was due to the absence of
    $7 million of environmental related plant closure costs,
    which were recorded in 2005. Depreciation and amortization
    decreased by $5 million due to a charge in 2005 related to
    additions to asset retirement obligations.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 80% to $128 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. This
    increase is primarily due to the higher operating profits as
    well as an increase of $19 million in dividends from our
    China ventures received in 2006.

Performance Products’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 decreased 2% to $176 million
    compared to $180 million in the same period in 2005. A 7%
    improvement in volumes was more than offset by lower pricing of
    9%. Volumes increased overall by 12% from the
    Sunett

®

sweetener products during the year ended December 31, 2006
    due to strong demand from our customers associated with new
    product launches, as well as the impact from the warmer than
    normal temperatures in Europe and North America. Consistent with
    our strategy,
    Sunett

®

sweetener pricing declined on lower unit selling prices
    associated with higher volumes to our major customers. Pricing
    for sorbates remained relatively flat during the year ended
    December 31, 2006, while worldwide overcapacity still
    prevailed in the industry.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests remained relatively flat for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005,
    increasing to $49 million from $46 million.

Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities, and certain
    other operating entities, including the captive insurance
    companies and the AT Plastics business.

Net sales for Other Activities increased to $257 million
    from $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005. The increase is primarily
    due to a full year of sales activity for AT Plastics in 2006
    compared to five months of activity in 2005. Net sales for AT
    Plastics increased to $235 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to $112 million for the
    same period in 2005. The increase was partially offset by an
    $8 million decrease in net sales resulting from the sale of
    PBI and the Vectran product lines during the second quarter of
    2005.

Operating loss of Other Activities remained flat for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in
    2005. The operating loss increased during the year due to
    executive severance and legal costs of $23 million
    associated with the acquisition of minority shares of CAG and
    related restructuring, stock-based compensation expense of
    $20 million resulting from our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) and $14 million related to our
    long-term incentive plan. The increase was offset by an increase
    in operating profit from the AT Plastics business of
    $17 million, the absence of $45 million related to the
    2005 advisor monitoring fee and the termination of advisor
    monitoring services agreement during the first quarter of 2005.

Loss from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests improved to a loss of $423 million from a loss of
    $526 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005. The decrease is primarily
    due to the decrease in operating losses previously discussed
    above within this segment and a decrease in interest expense of
    $93 million, due to $28 million related to accelerated
    amortization of deferred financing costs



and $74 million related to early redemption premiums
    associated with the partial redemption of the senior
    subordinated notes, senior discount notes and floating rate term
    loan, both recorded in 2005.

Nine
    Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Nine Months
    Ended December 31, 2004

Chemical Products’ net sales increased 28% to
    $3,264 million for the nine months ended December 31,
    2005 compared to the same period in 2004. The increase is
    primarily due to the inclusion of net sales from Vinamul and
    Acetex (excluding AT Plastics) during 2005 of approximately
    $280 million and $135 million, respectively. In
    addition, pricing increased for most products, but primarily
    from acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer and acetyl derivatives.
    The price increase was driven by continued strong demand, high
    industry utilization in base products and higher raw material
    costs, particularly for ethylene and natural gas. Overall,
    volumes declined 3% primarily from acetyl derivatives partially
    offset by significantly improved volumes from vinyl acetate
    monomer. Volumes for emulsions were flat. The increase in
    volumes from vinyl acetate monomer is primarily driven by
    continued strong demand.

Other (charges) gain, net increased by $14 million for the
    nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same
    period in 2004. Included in 2005 is $12 million in charges
    for a change in the environmental remediation strategy related
    to the closure of the Edmonton methanol plant and
    $6 million for severance charges related to the same
    closure.

Operating profit increased 65% to $408 million for the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period
    in 2004. The increase is principally driven by higher pricing,
    which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. The
    segment also benefited from a full quarter impact of its
    Southern Chemical methanol supply contract. Basic products, such
    as acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer, had greater success in
    maintaining margins while downstream products, such as polyvinyl
    alcohol and emulsions, continued to experience margin
    compression due to raw material costs rising faster than our
    pricing. Operating profit was also favorably impacted in this
    period due to $36 million from the settlement of
    transportation-related antitrust matters, $14 million in
    lower non-cash inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments
    and Acetex (excluding AT Plastics) recording an operating profit
    of $11 million in the nine months ended December 31,
    2005. The increase in operating profit was



partially offset by Vinamul recording operating losses of
    $15 million, which included integration costs in connection
    with the acquisition. Additionally, depreciation and
    amortization increased in 2005 compared to the same period in
    2004 primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments in
    both years.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 79% to $474 million compared to the
    same period in 2004 benefiting from increased operating profit
    and dividends from our Saudi cost investment.

Three
    Months Ended March 31, 2005 Compared with Three Months
    Ended March 31, 2004

Chemical Products’ net sales increased 28% to
    $1,035 million compared to the same period in 2004 mainly
    on higher pricing, segment composition changes, of which
    $66 million was related to Vinamul, and favorable currency
    effects. Pricing increased for most products, driven by
    continued strong demand and high utilization rates across the
    chemical industry.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased to $193 million from $63 million
    in the same period in 2004 as higher pricing was partially
    offset by higher raw material costs. Earnings also benefited
    from an increase of $9 million in dividends from our Saudi
    cost investment, which totaled $12 million in the quarter.
    The three months ended March 31, 2005 included
    $1 million in earnings from Vinamul, which included
    $1 million in non-cash inventory-related purchase
    accounting adjustments and integration costs in connection with
    the acquisition.

Nine
    Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Nine Months
    Ended December 31, 2004

Ticona’s net sales increased 2% to $648 million for
    the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
    same period in 2004. The increase is primarily driven by the
    successful implementation of price increases, introduction of
    new applications and increased penetration into key markets.
    This increase is partially offset by lower overall volumes and
    slightly unfavorable currency effects. Improved volumes from
    most of Ticona’s product lines were more than offset by a
    decline in polyacetal volumes attributable to a weak European
    automotive market and reduced sales to lower-end applications.

Ticona recorded income from other (charges) gains, net of
    $9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2005
    compared to expense of $37 million for the same period in
    2004. Included in 2005 is approximately $34 million
    associated with plumbing insurance recoveries, which was
    partially offset by an additional $25 million



non-cash impairment charge associated with the planned disposal
    of the COC business. The $37 million in 2004 is primarily
    related to a non-cash impairment charge from the COC business.

Operating profit increased to $21 million for the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005 compared to an operating
    loss of $12 million for the same period in 2004. The
    successful implementation of price increases helped to offset
    higher raw material and energy costs. Also contributing to the
    increase are productivity improvements, cost savings from an
    organizational redesign and lower depreciation and amortization
    expenses due to changes in the useful lives of certain property,
    plant and equipment. In addition, 2004 included a
    $20 million charge to cost of sales for a non-cash
    inventory-related purchase accounting adjustment. Operating
    profit in the nine months ended December 31, 2005 includes
    approximately $35 million for the loss on disposal of the
    COC business compared to an impairment charge of
    $32 million taken in 2004.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased to $65 million for the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005 compared to $26 million in the
    same period in 2004. This increase is primarily due to the
    increase in operating profit, improved equity earnings from
    Asian and U.S. affiliates due to increased sales volumes, a
    $46 million reduction in other (charges) gains, net, and
    the absence of a 2004 purchase accounting adjustment of
    $20 million in 2005.

Three
    Months Ended March 31, 2005 Compared with Three Months
    Ended March 31, 2004

Net sales for Ticona increased by 5% to $239 million
    compared to the same period in 2004 due to favorable currency
    effects and slightly higher volumes. Volumes increased for most
    product lines due to the successful introduction of new
    applications, which outweighed declines in polyacetal volumes
    resulting from our focus on high-end business and decreased
    sales to European automotive customers. Overall pricing remained
    flat over the same periods as successfully implemented price
    increases were offset by lower average pricing for certain
    products due to the commercialization of lower cost grades for
    new applications.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 13% to $51 million as the result of
    restructuring cost savings, the favorable effects of a planned
    maintenance turnaround and slightly higher volumes. These
    increases were partially offset by higher raw material and
    energy costs.

Nine
    Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Nine Months
    Ended December 31, 2004

Acetate Products’ net sales for the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005 increased 12% to $494 million
    compared to the same period in 2004. The improvement is due to a
    5% increase in pricing and a 7% increase in overall volumes.
    Higher flake volumes from increased sales to our recently
    expanded China tow ventures were partially offset by lower tow
    volumes due to the shutdown of our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada tow
    plant. Price increases partially offset higher raw material and
    energy costs.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Acetate
    Products’ segment recorded other (charges) gains, net of
    $8 million compared to $41 million in the same period
    in 2004. Other (charges) gains, net in 2005 primarily related to
    a change in the environmental remediation strategy related to
    the closure of the Edmonton methanol plant, while other
    (charges) gains, net in the same period in 2004 primarily
    represented asset impairments associated with the planned
    consolidation of tow and flake production.

Operating profit increased to $57 million in the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005 compared to an operating
    loss of $17 million in the same period in 2004. The
    increase is largely due to the decrease in other (charges)
    gains, net described above and a $23 million gain on the
    sale of the Rock Hill, S.C. plant and the Charlotte, N.C.
    research and development center. In addition, depreciation and
    amortization expense decreased primarily resulting from a lower
    depreciable asset base due to previous asset impairments and an
    $8 million charge for asset retirement obligations recorded
    in 2004 associated with the restructuring of the business.
    Higher pricing and savings from restructuring and productivity
    improvements more than offset increased raw material and energy
    costs, as well as temporarily higher manufacturing costs
    resulting from a realignment of inventory levels as part of the
    restructuring strategy.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased to $61 million for the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005 compared to a $13 million loss
    from continuing operations in the same period in 2004. This
    increase is primarily due to the increase in operating profit
    which included $33 million in lower other (charges) gains,
    net and the $23 million gain on disposition of assets.

Three
    Months Ended March 31, 2005 Compared with Three Months
    Ended March 31, 2004

Net sales for Acetate Products increased by 12% to
    $165 million compared to the same quarter in 2004 on higher
    volumes and pricing. Flake volumes increased due to higher sales
    to our recently expanded China tow ventures. Pricing increased
    to partially offset higher raw material and energy costs.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests more than doubled from $4 million in the first
    quarter of 2004 to $10 million in 2005 due to increased
    volumes, pricing and productivity improvements, which more than
    offset higher raw material and energy costs. Earnings also
    benefited from $2 million in lower depreciation and
    amortization expense largely as a result of previous
    restructuring impairments, which was offset by $3 million
    of expense for an asset retirement obligation.

Nine
    Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Nine Months
    Ended December 31, 2004

Net sales for the Performance Products segment increased 2% to
    $133 million compared to $131 million in the same
    period in 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes
    for the
    Sunett

®

sweetener partially offset by lower pricing. The increased
    volumes for
    Sunett

®

reflects continuous growth from new and existing applications
    mainly in the U.S. and European beverage and confectionary
    markets. Pricing for
    Sunett

®

declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher
    volumes to major customers which is consistent with our
    positioning strategy for the product. The pricing decrease for
    Sunett

®

was also driven by the expiration of a primary European and
    U.S. production patent for
    Sunett

®

at the end of March 2005. Pricing for Sorbates increased in
    2005, although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the
    industry.

Operating profit increased 111% from the same period in 2004.
    The increase was driven by improved business conditions for
    Sorbates, as well as the results of various ongoing cost saving
    initiatives. In addition, 2005 included a $3 million gain
    on the sale of the omega-3 DHA business as part of our strategy
    to sharpen its focus on the core sweetener and food protection
    businesses. 2004 included a $12 million charge to cost of
    sales for a non-cash inventory-related purchase accounting
    adjustment.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 127% primarily due to the increase in
    operating profit, which principally resulted from the absence of
    the purchase accounting charge in 2005 and the gain on the sale
    of the omega-3 DHA business.

Three
    Months Ended March 31, 2005 Compared with Three Months
    Ended March 31, 2004

Net sales for the Performance Products segment increased by 7%
    to $47 million compared to the same period in 2004 mainly
    on higher volumes, which more than offset lower pricing.
    Favorable currency movements also contributed to the sales
    increase. Higher volumes for
    Sunett

®

sweetener reflected strong growth from new and existing
    applications in the U.S. and European beverage and confectionary
    markets. Pricing for
    Sunett

®

declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher
    volumes to major customers. Pricing for sorbates continued to
    recover, although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the
    industry.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased to $12 million from $11 million in
    the same quarter in 2004. Strong volumes for
    Sunett

®

,
    as well as favorable currency movements and cost savings
    outpaced lower pricing for the sweetener.



Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities, and certain
    other operating entities, including the captive insurance
    companies and the AT Plastics business. AT Plastics is a
    business acquired in connection with the acquisition of Acetex
    in July 2005.

Nine
    Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Nine Months
    Ended December 31, 2004

Net sales for Other Activities increased to $132 million
    from $45 million in the same period in 2004. The increase
    is primarily due to the addition of $112 million in net
    sales from the AT Plastics business, which was partially offset
    by $13 million in lower third party revenues from the
    captive insurance companies and $7 million related to the
    divestitures of the performance polymer polybenzamidazole and
    vectran polymer fiber businesses in the second quarter of 2005.

The operating loss of Other Activities decreased to
    $107 million for the nine months ended December 31,
    2005 compared to $165 million for the same period in 2004.
    This decrease was primarily due to the absence of
    $38 million in management incentive compensation expenses,
    which were recorded in 2004, and lower IPO related consulting
    and professional fees. The management incentive compensation
    expenses included charges related to a new deferred compensation
    plan, a new stock incentive plan and other executive bonuses.
    The decrease is partially offset by operating losses from AT
    Plastics of $15 million in 2005.

Loss from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests improved to a loss of $273 million from a loss of
    $473 million in the same period in 2004. The decrease is
    primarily due to the decrease in operating losses discussed
    above and a decrease in interest expense of $89 million.
    The decrease in interest expense is due to expensing deferred
    financing costs of $89 million and a prepayment premium of
    $21 million associated with the refinancing of the
    mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in 2004. The decrease was
    partially offset by a $21 million increase in interest
    expense due to higher debt levels and interest rates in 2005.

Three
    Months Ended March 31, 2005 Compared with Three Months
    Ended March 31, 2004

Net sales for Other Activities increased slightly to
    $12 million from $11 million in the same quarter in
    2004. Loss from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased to $253 million from a loss of
    $57 million in the same period in 2004, largely due to
    $169 million of higher interest expense related to
    refinancing costs, increased debt levels, and higher interest
    rates in 2005. The loss includes $45 million of expenses
    for sponsor monitoring and related cancellation fees compared to
    other (charges) gains, net of $25 million in the same
    period in 2004 for advisory services related to the acquisition
    of CAG.



Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash
    generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents
    and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In
    addition, we have availability under our amended and restated
    credit facilities to assist, if required, in meeting our working
    capital needs and other contractual obligations. We believe we
    will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements
    for the remainder of the year, including debt service. If our
    cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt
    service and other obligations, we may be required to use other
    means available to us such as to increase our borrowings under
    our lines of credit, reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek
    additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our
    indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will
    continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or
    that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our
    revolving credit facilities.

Cash
    Flows

Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006 were
    $791 million, which was an increase of $401 million
    from December 31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents at
    December 31, 2005 were $390 million, which was a
    decrease of $448 million from December 31, 2004. See
    below for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents
    from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006 and the
    change in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2004
    to December 31, 2005.

Net
    Cash Provided by/Used in Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $751 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with
    $701 million for the same period in 2005. The increase in
    operating cash flows was due primarily to an increase in
    earnings from continuing operations partially offset by an
    increase in cash used from changes in operating assets and
    liabilities. Earnings from continuing operations increased to
    $407 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared with $276 million for the same period in 2005. The
    changes in operating assets and liabilities were driven
    primarily by higher trade and other receivables offset by higher
    trade payables. The increase in receivables is due to higher net
    sales. The increase in trade payables is due to the timing of
    payments.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to a cash inflow
    of $701 million in 2005 compared to a cash outflow of
    $164 million for the same period in 2004. This increase
    primarily resulted from a $452 million increase in net
    earnings from 2004, $429 million in lower pension
    contributions and a $142 million increase in cash received
    for trade receivables due to better receivables turnover. These
    increases were partially offset by $72 million in less cash
    from trade accounts payable as trade accounts payable grew, but
    at a slower rate than in 2004. In addition, we paid
    $77 million more interest payments and $45 million in
    monitoring fees.

Net
    Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash from investing activities improved to a cash outflow of
    $268 million in 2006 compared to a cash outflow of
    $907 million in 2005. The decrease in cash outflow is
    primarily due to cash paid of $473 million for the purchase
    of additional CAG shares in 2005, $216 million for the
    purchase of Acetex in July 2005 and $198 million for the
    purchase of Vinamul in February 2005. These decreases were
    offset by the net effect of an increase in capital expenditures
    of $40 million, an increase in purchases of other long term
    assets of $43 million, an increase in restricted cash of
    $42 million for the anticipated purchase of the remaining
    CAG shares, a decrease in net proceeds from the sale and
    purchase of marketable securities of $42 million, proceeds
    received for the Ticona plant relocation of $26 million in
    2006, a decrease in net proceeds received for the disposal of
    discontinued operations of $75 million, a decrease in fees
    associated with the 2005 acquisitions of $29 million and a
    decrease in the proceeds received from the sales of assets of
    $25 million.

Net cash from investing activities improved to a cash outflow of
    $907 million in 2005 compared to a cash outflow of
    $1,720 million in 2004. The cash outflow in 2004 primarily
    resulted from the CAG acquisition. The 2005 cash outflow
    included the acquisitions of the Vinamul and Acetex businesses,
    the acquisition of additional CAG shares and a decrease in net
    proceeds from disposal of discontinued operations of
    $64 million. The net proceeds from the disposal of
    discontinued operations represents cash received in 2005 from an
    early contractual settlement



of receivables of $75 million related to the sale of
    Vinnolit Kunstoff GmbH and Vintron GmbH. The net proceeds of
    $139 million in the same period last year represented the
    net proceeds from the sale of the acrylates business.

Our capital expenditures were $252 million,
    $212 million and $204 million for the calendar years
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures were
    primarily related to major replacements of equipment, capacity
    expansions, major investments to reduce future operating costs,
    environmental, health and safety initiatives and in 2004, the
    integration of a company-wide SAP platform. Capital expenditures
    in 2006 and 2005 included costs for the expansion of our
    Nanjing, China site into an integrated chemical complex. Capital
    expenditures in 2004 included expenditures related to a new
    Ticona research and administrative facility in Florence,
    Kentucky and the expansion of production facilities for
    polyacetal in Bishop, Texas and GUR in Oberhausen, Germany.
    Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately
    $280 million in 2007.

Net
    Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities

Net cash from financing activities decreased to a cash outflow
    of $108 million in 2006 compared to a cash outflow of
    $144 million in 2005. The cash outflow in 2006 primarily
    relates to the $100 million equivalent voluntary prepayment
    of our Senior Term Loan facility on July 14, 2006 as well
    as increased dividends paid on our Series A common stock
    and our preferred stock of $15 million in 2006. We
    commenced making common and preferred cash dividends during the
    third quarter of 2005. The cash outflow in 2005 primarily
    relates to the major financing activities for 2005 listed below.

Net cash from financing activities decreased to a cash outflow
    of $144 million in 2005 compared to a cash inflow of
    $2,643 million in the same period in 2004. The cash inflow
    in 2004 primarily reflected higher net proceeds from borrowings
    in connection with the acquisition of CAG. Major financing
    activities for 2005 are as follows:

•

Borrowings under the term loan facility of $1,135 million.

•

Distribution to Series B shareholders of $804 million.

•

Redemption and related premiums of the senior subordinated notes
    of $572 million and senior discount notes of
    $207 million.

•

Proceeds from the issuances of common stock, net of
    $752 million and preferred stock, net of $233 million.

•

Repayment of floating rate term loan, including related premium,
    of $354 million.

•

Exercise of Acetex’s option to redeem its


/


% senior
    notes for approximately $280 million.

•

Payment of cash dividends of $13 million on our
    Series A common stock and $8 million on our
    convertible preferred stock.

In addition, exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents
    increased to a favorable currency effect of $26 million in
    2006 from an unfavorable currency effect of $98 million in
    2005. Exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents
    decreased to an unfavorable currency effect of $98 million
    in 2005 from a favorable currency effect of $24 million in
    2004.

Liquidity

Our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service
    requirements over the next several years are significant and are
    substantially higher than historical amounts. As stated above,
    our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash
    generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents
    and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In
    addition, we have availability under our amended and restated
    credit facilities to assist, if required, in meeting our working
    capital needs and other contractual obligations.

Debt,
    Capital and Other Obligations

In January 2005, we completed an initial public offering of
    Series A common stock and received net proceeds of
    approximately $752 million after deducting
    underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses of
    $48 million. Concurrently, we received net proceeds of
    $233 million from the offering of our convertible preferred
    stock and



borrowed an additional $1,135 million under the amended and
    restated senior credit facilities. A portion of the proceeds of
    the share offerings were used to redeem $188 million of
    senior discount notes and $521 million of senior
    subordinated notes, which excludes early redemption premiums of
    $19 million and $51 million, respectively. We also
    used a portion of the proceeds from additional borrowings under
    our senior credit facilities to repay our $350 million
    floating rate term loan, which excludes a $4 million early
    redemption premium and used $200 million of the proceeds as
    the primary financing for the acquisition of the Vinamul
    emulsions business.

On April 7, 2005, we used the remaining proceeds to pay a
    special cash dividend to holders of our Series B common
    stock of $804 million. Upon payment of the
    $804 million dividend, all of the shares of Series B
    common stock converted automatically to shares of Series A
    common stock. In addition, we may use the available sources of
    liquidity to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of CAG.

As discussed above, in 2005 we issued $240 million
    aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock.
    Holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as
    and if, declared by our board of directors, out of funds legally
    available therefor, cash dividends at the rate of 4.25% per
    annum (or $1.06 per share) of liquidation preference,
    payable quarterly in arrears, commencing on May 1, 2005.
    Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of
    initial issuance. This dividend is expected to result in an
    annual dividend payment of approximately $10 million.
    Accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at an annual rate of
    4.25%. The preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the
    holder, at any time into shares of our Series A common
    stock at a conversion rate of approximately 1.25 shares of
    our Series A common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference
    of the preferred stock. For the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005, we paid $10 million and $8 million,
    respectively, in aggregate dividends on our preferred stock. In
    addition, at December 31, 2006, we had $2 million of
    accumulated but undeclared and unpaid dividends, which were
    declared on January 5, 2007 and paid on February 1,
    2007.

In July 2005, our board of directors adopted a policy of
    declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash
    dividend on each share of our Series A common stock at an
    annual rate initially equal to approximately 1% of the $16.00
    initial public offering price per share of our Series A
    common stock (or $0.16 per share) unless our board of
    directors in its sole discretion determines otherwise. For the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we paid
    $26 million and $13 million, respectively, in
    aggregate dividends on our Series A common stock. Based
    upon the number of outstanding shares as of December 31,
    2006, the anticipated annual cash dividend payment is
    approximately $26 million. We declared on January 5,
    2007 and paid on February 1, 2007 a quarterly cash dividend
    of $6 million. However, there is no assurance that
    sufficient cash or surplus will be available to pay the
    remainder of the anticipated 2007 cash dividend.

As of December 31, 2006, we had total debt of
    $3,498 million and cash and cash equivalents of
    $791 million. As of December 31, 2006, net debt (total
    debt less cash and cash equivalents) decreased to
    $2,707 million from $3,047 million as of
    December 31, 2005 primarily due to cash flows from
    operations of $751 million offset by capital expenditures
    of $252 million, the accretion of our senior discount notes
    of $40 million, foreign currency impacts of
    $73 million and the payment of dividends on our Series A
    common stock and our preferred stock of $36 million.

We were initially capitalized by equity contributions totaling
    $641 million from the Original Shareholders. On a stand
    alone basis, Celanese Corporation and Crystal US Holdings 3 LLC
    (“Crystal LLC”), the issuer of the senior discount
    notes, have no material assets other than the stock of their
    subsidiaries, and no independent external operations of their
    own apart from the financing. As such, Celanese Corporation and
    Crystal LLC generally will depend on the cash flow of their
    subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the preferred
    stock, the senior discount notes, the senior subordinated notes,
    the term loans and any revolving credit borrowings and
    guarantees.

Senior Credit Facilities.

As of
    December 31, 2006, the senior credit facilities of
    $2,450 million consist of a term loan facility of
    $1,622 million, a revolving credit facility of
    $600 million and a credit-linked revolving facility of
    $228 million.

Subsequent to the consummation of the initial public offering in
    January 2005, we entered into amended and restated senior credit
    facilities which increased the term facility. The terms of the
    amended and restated senior credit facilities are substantially
    similar to the terms of our immediately previous senior credit
    facilities. As of December 31, 2006, the term loan facility
    had a balance of $1,622 million (including approximately
    €253 million of euro denominated debt), which matures
    in 2011.

In addition, we have a $228 million credit-linked facility,
    which matures in 2009 and includes borrowing capacity available
    for letters of credit. As of December 31, 2006, there were
    $218 million of letters of credit issued under the
    credit-linked revolving facility; accordingly $10 million
    remained available for borrowing. Substantially all of the
    assets of Celanese Holdings LLC (“Celanese Holdings”),
    the direct parent of BCP Crystal, and, subject to certain
    exceptions, substantially all of its existing and future
    U.S. subsidiaries, referred to as U.S. Guarantors,
    secure these facilities. The borrowings under the senior credit
    facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin
    plus, at the borrower’s option, either a base rate or a
    LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for borrowing under the base
    rate option is 1.50% and for the LIBOR option, 2.50% (in each
    case, subject to a step-down based on a performance test).

In the first quarter of 2005, the revolving credit facility was
    increased from $380 million to $600 million under the
    amended and restated senior credit facilities. As of
    December 31, 2006, there were no letters of credit issued
    or outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility;
    accordingly $600 million remained available for borrowing.

In November of 2005, we entered into an amendment of the Amended
    and Restated Credit Agreement decreasing the margin over LIBOR
    on approximately $1,386 million of the U.S. dollar
    denominated portion of the



Term Loans from 2.25% to 2.00%. In addition, a further reduction
    of the interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.75% is allowed if certain
    conditions are met.

As stated in the prepayment requirements under the amended and
    restated senior credit facilities, we are required to prepay 50%
    of our excess cash flow against our senior term loan facility.
    Based on the excess cash flow calculation, as defined in our
    amended and restated senior credit facilities, at
    December 31, 2006, we will make a prepayment of
    approximately $98 million on the senior term loan facility
    in March 2007. In connection with this excess cash flow
    prepayment, we will write off approximately $1 million of
    unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the senior
    term loan facility.

In July 2006, we made a $100 million equivalent voluntary
    prepayment on our senior term loan facility. In connection with
    the voluntary prepayment, we wrote off approximately
    $1 million of unamortized deferred financing fees
    associated with the senior term loan facility.

The senior credit facilities are subject to prepayment
    requirements and contain covenants, defaults and other
    provisions. The senior credit facilities require us to prepay
    outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:

—

75% (such percentage will be reduced to 50% if BCP
    Crystal’s leverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any
    fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2005) of
    BCP Crystal’s excess cash flow;

—

100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset
    sales and casualty and condemnation events, unless BCP Crystal
    reinvests or contracts to reinvest those proceeds in assets to
    be used in BCP Crystal’s business or to make certain other
    permitted investments within 12 months, subject to certain
    limitations;

—

100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt other
    than debt permitted under the senior credit facilities, subject
    to certain exceptions; and

— 50% of the net cash proceeds of issuances of equity
    of Celanese Holdings, subject to certain exceptions.

BCP Crystal may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the
    senior credit facility at any time without premium or penalty,
    other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to
    LIBOR loans.

In connection with the borrowing by BCP Crystal under the term
    loan portion of the senior credit facilities, BCP Crystal and
    CAC have entered into an intercompany loan agreement whereby BCP
    Crystal has agreed to lend the proceeds from any borrowings
    under its term loan facility to CAC. The intercompany loan
    agreement contains the same amortization provisions as the
    senior credit facilities. The interest rate with respect to the
    loans made under the intercompany loan agreement is the same as
    the interest rate with respect to the loans under BCP
    Crystal’s term loan facility plus three basis points. BCP
    Crystal intends to service the indebtedness under its term loan
    facility with the proceeds of payments made to it by CAC under
    the intercompany loan agreement.

Senior Subordinated Notes.

In February 2005,
    we used approximately $521 million of the net proceeds of
    the offering of our Series A common stock to redeem a
    portion of the senior subordinated notes and $51 million to
    pay the premium associated with the redemption. As of
    December 31, 2006, the senior subordinated notes, excluding
    $3 million of premiums, consist of $796 million of


/


% Senior
    Subordinated Notes due 2014 and $171 million
    (€130 million) of


/


%
    Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. All of BCP Crystal’s
    obligations under the senior credit facilities guarantee the
    senior subordinated notes on an unsecured senior subordinated
    basis.

Senior Discount Notes.

In September 2004,
    Crystal LLC and Crystal US Sub 3 Corp., a subsidiary of Crystal
    LLC, issued $853 million aggregate principal amount at
    maturity of their senior discount notes due 2014 consisting of
    $163 million principal amount at maturity of their 10%
    Series A Senior Discount Notes due 2014 and
    $690 million principal amount at maturity of their


/


%
    Series B Senior Discount Notes due 2014 (collectively, the
    “senior discount notes”). The gross proceeds of the
    offering were $513 million. Approximately $500 million
    of the proceeds were distributed to our Original Shareholders,
    with the remaining proceeds used to pay fees associated with the
    refinancing. Until October 1, 2009, interest on the senior
    discount notes will accrue in the form of an increase in the
    accreted value of such notes. Cash interest on the senior
    discount notes will accrue commencing on October 1, 2009
    and be payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and
    October 1. In February 2005, we used approximately
    $37 million of the net proceeds of the offering of our
    Series A common stock to redeem a portion of the
    Series A senior discount notes and $151 million to
    redeem a portion of the Series B senior discount notes and
    $19 million to pay the premium associated with such
    redemption. As of December 31, 2006, there were
    $554 million aggregate principal amount at maturity
    outstanding, consisting of $106 million principal amount at
    maturity of the 10% Series A Senior Discount Notes due 2014
    and $448 million principal amount at maturity of the


/


%
    Series B



Senior Discount Notes due 2014. At December 31, 2006,
    $339 million and $81 million were outstanding under
    the


/


%
    and 10% Senior Discount Notes, respectively.

Other Debt.

Other debt of $489 million,
    which does not include a $2 million fair value reduction
    due to purchase accounting, is primarily made up of fixed rate
    pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, short-term
    borrowings from affiliated companies and capital lease
    obligations.

Other Cash Obligations.

Unconditional Purchase
    Obligations primarily include take or pay contracts. We do not
    expect to incur any material losses under these contractual
    arrangements. In addition, these contracts may include variable
    price components.

Other Contractual Obligations primarily includes committed
    capital spending and fines associated with the
    U.S. antitrust settlement described in Note 25 to the
    consolidated financial statements. Included in Other Contractual
    Obligations is a €99 million fine from the European
    Commission related to antitrust matters in the sorbates
    industry, which is pending an appeal. We are indemnified by a
    third party for 80% of the expenses relating to these matters,
    which is not reflected in the amount above.

Covenants.

The senior credit facilities
    require BCP Crystal to maintain the following financial
    covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest
    coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures limitation. As
    of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these
    covenants. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial
    statements for information regarding non-financial covenants.

At December 31, 2006, we have contractual guarantees and
    commitments as follows:

Deferred Compensation.

See Note 22,
    Stock-Based and Other Management Compensation Plans, of the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information.
    The remaining aggregate maximum amount payable at
    December 31, 2006 under this plan is $142 million, of
    which $19 million has been accrued at that date due to the
    accelerated vesting of certain plan participants. Should the
    payout be triggered, we will fund the payments with either
    existing cash, or borrowings from the revolving credit facility,
    or a combination thereof. Upon the occurrence of the triggering
    events mentioned in Note 22 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the maximum amount earned and vested under the plan
    as of December 31, 2006 is approximately $75 million,
    exclusive of $19 million accrued in 2006 and payable in
    2007 due to the accelerated vesting of certain plan participants.

Long-Term Incentive Plan.

See Note 22,
    Stock-Based and Other Management Compensation Plans, of the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information. On
    February 16, 2007, approximately $26 million was paid
    to the LTIP plan participants.

Domination Agreement.

The Domination Agreement
    was approved at the CAG extraordinary shareholders’ meeting
    on July 31, 2004. The Domination Agreement between CAG and
    the Purchaser became effective on October 1, 2004. Our
    subsidiaries, BCP Caylux Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A. and BCP
    Crystal, have each agreed to provide the Purchaser with
    financing to strengthen the Purchaser’s ability to fulfill
    its obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
    Agreement and to ensure that the Purchaser will perform all of
    its obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
    Agreement when such obligations become due, including, without
    limitation, the obligation to compensate CAG for any statutory
    annual loss incurred by CAG during the term of the Domination
    Agreement. If BCP Caylux

and/or

BCP
    Crystal are obligated to make payments under such guarantees



or other security to the Purchaser

and/or

the
    minority shareholders, we may not have sufficient funds for
    payments on our indebtedness when due. We have not had to
    compensate CAG for an annual loss for any period during which
    the Domination Agreement has been in effect.

Squeeze-Out Payment.

The Squeeze-Out was
    registered in the commercial register on December 31, 2006,
    after several lawsuits by minority shareholders challenging the
    shareholders’ resolution approving the Squeeze-Out were
    withdrawn pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into
    between plaintiff shareholders, the Purchaser and CAG on the
    same day. A total amount of approximately €62 million
    (approximately $82 million at December 31,
    2006) was paid to minority shareholders in January 2007 as
    fair cash compensation for the acquisition of their shares of
    CAG.

Other
    Obligations

We expect to continue to incur costs for the following
    significant obligations. Although, we cannot predict with
    certainty the annual spending for these matters, such matters
    will affect our future cash flows.

Other Obligations




We are secondarily liable under a lease agreement pursuant to
    which we have assigned a direct obligation to a third party. The
    lease assumed by the third party expires on April 30, 2012.
    The lease liability for the period from January 1, 2007 to
    April 30, 2012 is estimated to be approximately
    $41 million.

Standby letters of credit of $218 million outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 are irrevocable obligations of an issuing
    bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that
    certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with
    specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that
    material payments will be required under these agreements. The
    stand-by letters of credit include approximately
    $29 million related to obligations associated with the
    sorbates antitrust matters as described in the “Other
    Contractual Obligations” above.

For additional commitments and contingencies, see Note 25
    to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental
    Matters

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine
    months ended December 31, 2004, the Successor’s
    worldwide expenditures, including expenditures for legal
    compliance, internal environmental initiatives and remediation
    of active, orphan, divested and U.S. Superfund sites were
    $71 million, $84 million and $66 million,
    respectively. The Predecessor’s worldwide expenditures for
    the three months ended March 31, 2004 were
    $22 million. The Successor’s capital project related
    environmental expenditures for the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
    and the Predecessor’s for the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, included in worldwide expenditures, were
    $5 million, $8 million, $6 million and
    $2 million, respectively. Environmental reserves for
    remediation matters were $114 million and $124 million
    as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which
    represents our best estimate. See Note 18 to the
    consolidated financial statements.

It is anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will
    continue to be imposed on the chemical industry in general. We
    cannot predict with certainty future environmental expenditures,
    especially expenditures beyond 2007. Due to new air regulations
    in the U.S., we expect that there will be a temporary increase
    in compliance costs that will total approximately
    $10 million to $15 million through 2008.

Accordingly, Emission Trading Systems will directly affect the
    power plants at the Kelsterbach and Oberhausen sites in Germany
    and the Lanaken site in Belgium, as well as power plants
    operated by InfraServ entities on sites at which we operate. We,
    along with the InfraServ entities, may be required to purchase
    carbon dioxide credits,



which could result in increased operating costs, or may be
    required to develop additional cost-effective methods to reduce
    carbon dioxide emissions further, which could result in
    increased capital expenditures. Additionally, the new regulation
    indirectly affects our other operations in the European Union,
    which may experience higher energy costs from third party
    providers. We have not yet determined the impact of this
    legislation on our operating costs.

Due to our industrial history, we have the obligation to
    remediate specific areas on our active sites as well as on
    divested, orphan or U.S. Superfund sites. In addition, as
    part of the demerger agreement with Hoechst, a specified
    proportion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities
    from a number of pre-demerger divestitures was transferred to
    us. We have provided for such obligations when the event of loss
    is probable and reasonably estimable. We believe that the
    environmental costs will not have a material adverse effect on
    our financial position, but they may have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given
    accounting period. See Notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated
    financial statements.

Pension
    and Other Benefits

The funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan
    assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present
    value of projected benefit obligations. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no pension
    contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension
    plan. Contributions to other non-qualified plans (including Rest
    of the World) for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005 were $53 million and $44 million, respectively.

On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, which caused us
    to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the
    fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations)
    of our benefit plans in the December 31, 2006 consolidated
    balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The net impact of
    the adoption of SFAS No. 158 was an increase in
    pension and postretirement benefit obligations of
    $113 million with an offset to Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Based on the funded
    status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit
    plans as of December 31, 2006, we reported a total unfunded
    amount of $884 million of pension and postretirement
    benefit obligations. Our adoption of SFAS No. 158 on
    December 31, 2006 had no impact on our earnings.

Our spending associated with other benefit plans, primarily
    retiree medical, defined contribution and long-term disability,
    amounted to $59 million and $67 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See
    Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

In 2004, we amended our long-term disability plan to align the
    benefit levels with the retiree medical plan. As a result of
    this change, the employee contribution for the long-term
    disability medical coverage increased substantially for current
    participants in the disability plan. Subsequent to the adoption
    of the change, enrollment in the plan has been trending
    downward, with 20% of the participants declining coverage.
    Accordingly, as a result of the lower enrollment experience, we
    reduced the disability accrual by $3 million and
    $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. In addition, medical claims assumptions were
    lowered to reflect actual plan experience and the percentage of
    long-term disability medical payments paid for by Medicare. This
    change lowered the long-term disability accrual by an additional
    $9 million.

Other
    Matters

Plumbing
    Actions and Sorbates Litigation

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims
    incidental to the normal conduct of our business. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, there were $14 million of
    cash inflows in connection with the plumbing actions and
    sorbates litigation. In February 2005, we settled with an
    insurance carrier and received cash proceeds of $44 million
    in March 2005 and in December 2005, we received $30 million
    in additional settlements. For the year ended December 31,
    2004, there were no net cash inflows in connection with the
    plumbing actions and sorbates litigation. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were reserves of
    $214 million and $197 million, respectively, for these
    matters. In addition, we have receivables from insurance
    companies and Hoechst in connection with the plumbing and
    sorbates matters of $141 million and $140 million as
    of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.



Although it is impossible at this time to determine with
    certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters, we believe,
    based on the advice of legal counsel, that adequate provisions
    have been made and that the ultimate outcome will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, but could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
    cash flows in any given accounting period. See Note 25 to
    the consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any material off-balance sheet
    arrangements.

Market
    Risks

Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about
    Market Risk” under Item 7A of this

Form 10-K

for additional information about our Market Risks.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection
    and application of significant accounting policies. The
    preparation of these financial statements and application of
    these policies requires us to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
    of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not
    currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
    that would result in materially different results.

We believe the following accounting polices and estimates are
    critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present
    in the current economic environment. These matters, and the
    judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential
    to understanding our reported and future operating results. See
    Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a more
    comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies.

Recoverability
    of Long-Lived Assets

Our business is capital intensive and has required, and will
    continue to require, significant investments in property, plant
    and equipment. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying
    amount of property, plant and equipment was $2,155 million
    and $2,031 million, respectively. We assess the
    recoverability of property, plant and equipment to be held and
    used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group
    of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to
    be generated by the asset or group of assets. If such assets are
    considered impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as
    the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds
    the fair value of the assets.

In December 2004, we approved a plan to dispose of the COC
    business included within the Ticona segment. This decision
    resulted in $25 million and $32 million of asset
    impairment charges recorded as other (charges) gains, net
    related to the COC business in the year ended December 31,
    2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
    respectively.

As a result of the consolidation of tow production and the
    termination of filament production, the Acetate Products segment
    recorded impairment charges of $50 million associated with
    plant and equipment in the nine months ended December 31,
    2004.

We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our
    goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
    lives at least annually or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
    not be fully recoverable. As a result of our annual impairment
    test on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, we
    recorded an impairment loss of $2 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, we had $1,338 million and $1,430 million,
    respectively, of goodwill and other intangible assets, net.

As of December 31, 2006, there were no significant changes
    in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances that led
    us to believe goodwill might have been impaired. We will
    continue to evaluate the need for



impairment if changes in circumstances or available information
    indicate that impairment may have occurred. We perform the
    required impairment test at least annually during the third
    quarter of our fiscal year using June 30 balances unless
    circumstances dictate more frequent testing. During 2006, we
    performed the impairment test and determined that there was no
    impairment of goodwill.

A prolonged general economic downturn and, specifically, a
    continued downturn in the chemical industry as well as other
    market factors could intensify competitive pricing pressure,
    create an imbalance of industry supply and demand, or otherwise
    diminish volumes or profits. Such events, combined with changes
    in interest rates, could adversely affect our estimates of
    future net cash flows to be generated by our long-lived assets.
    Consequently, it is possible that our future operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected by additional
    impairment charges related to the recoverability of our
    long-lived assets.

Other
    (Charges) Gains, Net

Other (charges) gains, net include provisions for restructuring
    and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal
    ongoing course of operations. Restructuring provisions represent
    costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to
    major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign our
    operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a
    decision to exit non-strategic businesses. These measures are
    based on formal management decisions, establishment of
    agreements with the employees’ representatives or
    individual agreements with the affected employees as well as the
    public announcement of the restructuring plan. The related
    reserves reflect certain estimates, including those pertaining
    to separation costs, settlements of contractual obligations and
    other closure costs. We reassess the reserve requirements to
    complete each individual plan under our restructuring program at
    the end of each reporting period. Actual experience has been and
    may continue to be different from these estimates. See
    Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental
    Liabilities

We recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to
    environmental matters if available information indicates that it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss is reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the
    site, we accrue through time horizons of ten to
    fifteen years, unless we have government orders or other
    agreements that extend beyond these time horizons. All other
    fees are expensed as incurred. If the event of loss is neither
    probable nor reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible,
    we provide appropriate disclosure in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements if the contingency is
    considered material. The measurement of environmental
    liabilities is based on a range of our periodic estimate of what
    it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation
    effort. We use our best estimate within the range to establish
    our environmental reserves. We utilize third parties to assist
    in the management and the development of our cost estimates for
    our sites. We accrue for legal fees related to loss contingency
    matters when the costs associated with defense can be reasonably
    estimated and are probable to occur. See also Note 18 to
    the consolidated financial statements.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

Total reserves for asset retirement obligations were
    $59 million and $54 million at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. SFAS No. 143 requires that the
    fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
    recognized in the period in which it is incurred and FASB
    Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 143 (“FIN No. 47”)

provides guidelines as to when a company is required to
    record a conditional asset retirement obligation. The liability
    is measured at the discounted fair value and is adjusted to its
    present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is
    recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are
    capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related
    long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining
    useful life. We have identified but not recognized asset
    retirement obligations related to substantially all of our
    existing operating facilities. Examples of these types of
    obligations include demolition, decommissioning, disposal and
    restoration activities. Legal obligations exist in connection
    with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the
    facilities or abandonment of the existing operations. However,
    operations at these facilities are expected to continue
    indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value
    cannot be determined at this time. We will continue to assess
    strategies that may differ from past business decisions
    regarding the continuing operation of existing facilities. Asset
    retirement obligations will be recorded if these



strategies are changed and probabilities of closure are assigned
    to existing facilities. If certain operating facilities were to
    close, the related asset retirement obligations could
    significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows.

Realization
    of Deferred Tax Assets

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable
    income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. Such evaluations require
    significant management judgments. Valuation allowances have been
    established primarily for U.S. federal and state net
    operating losses carryforwards, Mexican net operating loss
    carryforwards and Canadian deferred tax assets. See Note 21
    in the consolidated financial statements.

Tax
    Contingencies

We have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may
    become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax
    authorities. We accrue for tax contingencies when it is probable
    that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the
    amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Although
    we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax
    returns are reasonable, we nevertheless have established tax and
    interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities
    may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional
    liabilities for taxes and interest. These amounts are reviewed
    as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that
    affect our potential liability for additional taxes, such as
    lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax
    audits, additional exposure based on current calculations,
    identification of new issues, release of administrative
    guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a
    particular tax issue. This policy may be impacted by the
    adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), as
    discussed in Note 5 in the consolidated financial
    statements.

Benefit
    Obligations

We have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering
    substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements.
    With respect to its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension
    plan, minimum funding requirements are determined by the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Contributions to the
    various pension and other postretirement benefit plans are
    further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financials
    statements. Benefits are generally based on years of service

and/or

compensation. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of
    the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These
    assumptions include the weighted average discount rate, rates of
    increase in compensation levels, expected long-term rates of
    return on plan assets and increases or trends in health care
    costs. In addition to the above mentioned assumptions, actuarial
    consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and
    mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation.
    The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual
    results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher
    or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of
    participants. These differences may result in a significant
    impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future
    periods.

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements
    related to pension and other postretirement benefits are
    determined on an actuarial basis. A significant assumption used
    in determining our pension expense is the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets of 8.5% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit
    pension plan, which represents greater than 84% and 76% of
    pension plan assets and liabilities, respectively. On average,
    the actual return on plan assets over the long-term (15 to
    20 years) has exceeded 9.0%. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the U.S. qualified defined benefit
    pension plan assets actual return was 630 basis points more
    than the expected long-term rate of return of plan assets.
    However, for the year ended December 31, 2005, the actual
    return was 50 basis points less than the expected long-term
    rate of return of plan assets. Based on our investment strategy,
    we believe that 8.5% is a reasonable long-term rate of return.



We estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected
    long-term rate of return for the U.S. qualified defined
    benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated
    $6 million in 2006. Another estimate that affects our
    pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount
    rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and
    other postretirement benefit plan obligations. At the end of
    each year, we determine the appropriate discount rate, used to
    determine the present value of future cash flows currently
    expected to be required to settle the pension and other
    postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is
    generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate
    fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2006, we increased
    the discount rate to 5.88% from 5.63% at December 31, 2005
    for the U.S. plans. We estimate that a 50 basis point
    decline in the discount rate for the U.S. pension and
    postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other
    postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated
    $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and
    our benefit obligations by approximately $165 million and
    approximately $12 million, respectively. We estimate that a
    50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the

non-U.S. pension

and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other
    postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated
    $2 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and
    will increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $56 million and approximately $3 million, respectively.

In 2005 and 2004, we experienced significant increases (in
    excess of $300 million) in unrecognized net actuarial
    pension losses. The losses were mainly due to the decline in the
    discount rate utilized to reflect current market conditions.
    However, in 2006, the discount rate increased resulting in a
    lower unrecognized loss of $64 million. The increase in
    discount rate and higher actual returns on plan assets resulted
    in lower pension and postretirement benefit obligations in 2006
    of approximately $295 million compared to 2005.

Other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life
    insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service
    requirements. The postretirement benefit cost for the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31,
    2004, includes $21 million, $25 million,
    $21 million and $8 million, respectively. The accrued
    post-retirement liability was $343 million and
    $408 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and is included in other noncurrent liabilities.
    The key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation (“APBO”) are the discount rate and the
    healthcare cost trend rate. The healthcare cost trend rate has a
    significant effect on the reported amounts of APBO and related
    expense. For example, increasing or decreasing the healthcare
    cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would
    result in the APBO at December 31, 2006, and the 2006
    postretirement benefit cost to change by approximately
    $4 million and $1 million, respectively. See
    Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting
    for Commitments and Contingencies

We are subject to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits,
    claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of
    our business, relating to and including product liability,
    patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices, release of chemicals
    into the environment and employment matters, which are handled
    and defended in the ordinary course of business. We routinely
    assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
    these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably
    estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by
    us after considering a broad range of information including:
    notifications, demands, settlements which have been received
    from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates
    performed by independent consultants and outside counsel,
    available facts, identification of other potentially responsible
    parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior
    experience. A determination of the amount of loss contingency
    required, if any, is assessed in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5 “

Contingencies and
    Commitments

” and recorded if probable and estimable
    after careful analysis of each individual matter. The required
    reserves may change in the future due to new developments in
    each matter and as additional information becomes available. See
    Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of the outstanding commitments and
    contingencies and the related impact on our financial position
    and results of operations.

Business
    Combinations

Upon closing an acquisition, we estimate the fair values of
    assets and liabilities acquired as soon as practicable. Given
    the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize
    the acquired company’s balance sheet (frequently with
    implications for the purchase price of the acquisition), then to
    adjust the acquired company’s accounting policies,
    procedures, books and records to our standards, it is often
    several quarters before we are able to finalize



those initial fair value estimates. Accordingly, it is not
    uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised
    within twelve months of an acquisition. The judgments made in
    determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives,
    can materially impact Net earnings (loss). See Note 2 to
    the consolidated financial statements.

Captive
    Insurance Companies

We have two wholly owned insurance companies (the
    “Captives”) that are used as a form of self insurance
    for property, liability and workers compensation risks. One of
    the Captives also insures certain third party risks. The
    liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated
    risk of loss which is based on our estimates and actuarial
    valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the portion
    of the third party premiums written applicable to the unexpired
    terms of the policies in-force. Liabilities are recognized for
    known claims when sufficient information has been developed to
    indicate involvement of a specific policy and we can reasonably
    estimate its liability. In addition, liabilities have been
    established to cover additional exposure on both known and
    unasserted claims. Estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and
    updated regularly. It is possible that actual results could
    differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Premiums
    written are recognized as revenue based on the terms of the
    policies. Capitalization of the Captives is determined by
    regulatory guidelines.

The Captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their
    risk of loss. The reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the
    Captives from its obligation to policyholders. Failure of the
    reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to
    the Captives. The Captives evaluate the financial condition of
    its reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to
    minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
    insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed
    non-collectible.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
    Risks

We are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial
    operations. Our market risk consists principally of exposure to
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We
    have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency
    exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices as described
    below. Contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under
    SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities

amended by SFAS No. 138,

Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
    Hedging Activities

and SFAS No. 148,

Amendment
    of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

We may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the
    exposure of interest rate risk inherent in our outstanding debt
    by locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired level of
    fixed/floating rate debt depending on market conditions. At both
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had an outstanding interest
    rate swap with a notional amount of $300 million. At
    December 31, 2004, we had no interest rate swap agreements
    in place. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
    $1.6 billion of variable rate debt, net of the interest
    rate swap. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase annual
    interest expense by approximately $16 million.

See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our interest rate risk management and the
    related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

We have receivables and payables denominated in currencies other
    than the functional currencies of the various subsidiaries,
    which create foreign exchange risk. For the purposes of this
    document, our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and
    the functional reporting currency of CAG continues to be the
    euro. The U.S. dollar, the euro, Mexican peso, Japanese
    yen, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar
    are the most significant sources of currency risk. Accordingly,
    we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize
    our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The foreign
    currency contracts are mainly for booked exposure and, in some
    cases, cash flow hedges for anticipated exposure associated with
    sales from the Performance Products segment. The terms of these
    contracts are generally under one year. Our centralized hedging
    strategy states that foreign currency denominated receivables or
    liabilities recorded by the operating entities will be
    internally hedged, only the remaining net foreign exchange
    position will then be hedged externally with banks. As a result,
    foreign currency forward contracts relating to this centralized
    strategy did not meet the criteria of SFAS No. 133 to
    qualify for hedge accounting. Net foreign currency transaction
    gains or losses are recognized on the underlying transactions,
    which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency
    forward contracts.

A substantial portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses are denominated in currencies other than
    U.S. dollar, principally the euro. Fluctuations in the
    value of these currencies against the U.S. dollar,
    particularly the value of the euro, can have, and in the past
    have had, a direct and material impact on the business and
    financial results. For example, a decline in the value of the
    euro versus the U.S. dollar, results in a decline in the
    U.S. dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and
    earnings due to translation effects. Likewise, an increase in
    the value of the euro versus the U.S. dollar would result
    in an opposite effect.

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
    a foreign operation, we entered into cross currency swaps with
    certain financial institutions. Under the terms of the cross
    currency swap arrangements, we will pay approximately
    €13 million in interest and receive approximately
    $16 million in interest on each June 15 and
    December 15. Upon maturity of the cross currency swap
    agreement in June 2008, we will pay approximately
    €276 million and receive approximately
    $333 million. We designated the cross currency swaps, part
    of our senior euro term loan and the euro senior subordinated
    note as a net investment hedge (for accounting purposes) in the
    fourth quarter of 2004.

See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and
    the related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.



Commodity
    Risk Management

Our policy for the majority of our commodity raw materials
    requirements allows us to enter into forward purchase and/or
    swap contracts to manage our risk. Although these contracts are
    structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity
    prices, they can also limit the potential benefit we might have
    otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. We have
    elected to apply the normal purchases provision to the forward
    purchase and swap contracts that qualify as derivative
    instruments as it was probable at the inception and throughout
    the term of the contract that they would not settle net and
    would result in physical delivery. Realized gains and losses on
    these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon
    settlement of the contract.

See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our commodity risk management and the
    related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Controls
    and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(b)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting during our fourth quarter of 2006.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
    company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
    our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that
    receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in
    accordance with management authorization; and providing
    reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
    disposition of company assets that could have a material effect
    on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting is not intended to provide
    absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial
    statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
    the company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2006. KPMG LLP has audited
    this assessment of our internal control over financial
    reporting; their report is included below.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

,

that Celanese Corporation and
    subsidiaries (“Successor” or the “Company”)
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Celanese
    Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Also, in our opinion, Celanese Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Celanese Corporation as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005 and the nine-month period ended
    December 31, 2004, and our report dated February 20,
    2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Celanese Corporation (“Successor” or “the
    Company”) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005
    and the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the
    nine-month period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Celanese Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    February 20, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
    internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Accounting
    Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment,” during the year ended December 31, 2006.

As discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Accounting
    Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,”
    during the year ended December 31, 2006.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective April 1, 2004 (a convenience date for
    the April 6, 2004 acquisition date), a subsidiary of
    Celanese Corporation acquired 84.3% of the outstanding stock of
    Celanese AG in a business combination. As a result of the
    acquisition, the consolidated financial information for the
    periods after the acquisition is presented on a different cost
    basis than that for the periods before the acquisition and,
    therefore, is not comparable.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Supervisory Board

Celanese AG:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows of
    Celanese AG and subsidiaries (“Predecessor”) for the
    three-month period ended March 31, 2004 (“Predecessor
    periods”). These consolidated financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
    a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the results
    of operations and cash flows of Celanese AG and subsidiaries for
    the Predecessor periods, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements,
    Celanese AG and subsidiaries changed from using the last-in,
    first-out or LIFO method of determining cost of inventories at
    certain locations to the first-in, first-out or FIFO method.

CELANESE

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Description
    of the Company

Celanese Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively the
    “Company” or the “Successor”) is an
    integrated global hybrid chemical company, representing the
    former business of Celanese AG and its subsidiaries
    (“CAG” or the “Predecessor”). The
    Company’s business involves processing chemical raw
    materials, such as ethylene and propylene, and natural products,
    including natural gas and wood pulp, into value-added chemicals
    and chemical-based products.

Basis
    of Presentation

The financial position, results of operations and cash flows and
    related disclosures for periods prior to April 1, 2004 (a
    convenience date for the April 6, 2004 acquisition date),
    the effective date of the acquisition of Celanese AG (the
    “Effective Date”), are presented as the results of the
    Predecessor. The financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows and related disclosures for periods subsequent to the
    Effective Date, are presented as those of the Successor.

The consolidated financial statements of the Successor as of and
    for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and as of
    and for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 reflect the
    acquisition of CAG under the purchase method of accounting in
    accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 141,

Business Combinations.

The results of the Successor are not comparable to the results
    of the Predecessor due to the difference in the basis of
    presentation of purchase accounting as compared to historical
    cost. Furthermore, the Successor and the Predecessor have
    different accounting policies with respect to certain matters
    (See Note 4). The consolidated financial statements for the
    three months ended March 31, 2004 have been prepared in
    accordance with CAG’s accounting policies (See
    Note 4) and the requirements for interim financial
    reporting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) No. 28,

Interim Financial
    Reporting.

Acquisition
    of CAG

Original
    Acquisition of CAG

Pursuant to a voluntary tender offer commenced in February 2004,
    Celanese Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known
    as BCP Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG (the
    ”Purchaser”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
    Celanese Corporation, on April 6, 2004 acquired
    approximately 84% of the ordinary shares of Celanese AG,
    excluding treasury shares, (the “CAG Shares”) for a
    purchase price of $1,693 million, including direct
    acquisition costs of $69 million (the
    “Acquisition”). The Company has allocated the purchase
    price on the basis of the fair value of the underlying assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed. The assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed on the Effective Date were reflected at fair
    value for the approximate 84% portion acquired and at historical
    basis for the remaining minority interest. Upon completion of
    the Organizational Restructuring (as defined below), the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed of Celanese Americas
    Corporation (“CAC”) are reflected at fair value for
    the 100% portion acquired. The excess of the purchase price over
    the amounts allocated to specific assets and liabilities is
    included in goodwill. The purchase price allocation was as
    follows:

Cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other current assets,
    accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other current
    liabilities were stated at their historical carrying values,
    which approximates fair value, given the short term nature of
    these assets and liabilities.

The estimated fair value of inventory, as of the Effective Date,
    was calculated based on the Company’s computations. The
    consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 includes $53 million in cost of
    sales representing the capitalized manufacturing profit in
    inventory on hand as of the Effective Date. The capitalized
    manufacturing profit was recorded in purchase accounting and the
    inventory was subsequently sold during the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004.

Deferred income taxes were provided in the consolidated balance
    sheet based on the Company’s estimate of the tax versus
    book basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
    Valuation allowances were established against those assets for
    which realization is not likely, primarily in the U.S. (See
    Note 21).

The Company’s estimate of pension and other postretirement
    benefit obligations were reflected in the allocation of purchase
    price at the projected benefit obligation less plan assets at
    fair market value.

In connection with the Acquisition, at the acquisition date, the
    Company implemented plans to exit or restructure certain
    activities. The Company recorded liabilities of
    $60 million, primarily for employee severance and related
    costs in connection with the plan and approved the continuation
    of all existing Predecessor restructuring and exit plans.

At the time of the Acquisition, CAG had a leading market
    position as a global producer of acetic acid and is the
    world’s largest producer of vinyl acetate monomer. It has
    competitive cost structures based on economies of scale,
    vertical integration, technical know-how and the use of advanced
    technologies. Further, CAG has global reach, with major
    operations in North America, Europe and Asia and an extensive
    network of ventures. These characteristics, together with the
    potential to a) reduce production and material costs,
    b) increase cash flow through advanced process control
    projects, and c) optimize the value of the portfolio
    through strategic acquisitions and divestitures contributed to a
    purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net tangible
    and intangible assets acquired from CAG and as a result, the
    Company has recorded goodwill in connection with the transaction.

Domination
    Agreement

On October 1, 2004, a domination and profit and loss
    transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”)
    between CAG and the Purchaser became operative. When the
    Domination Agreement became operative, the Purchaser became
    obligated to offer to acquire all outstanding CAG shares from
    the minority shareholders of CAG in return for payment of fair
    cash compensation. The amount of this fair cash compensation was
    determined to be €41.92 per share, plus interest, in
    accordance with applicable German law. Any minority shareholder
    who elected

not to sell its shares to the Purchaser was, until the
    Squeeze-Out (as defined below) was registered in the commercial
    register on December 22, 2006, entitled to remain a
    shareholder of CAG and to receive from the Purchaser a gross
    guaranteed annual payment on its shares of €3.27 per
    CAG share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any dividend.
    Taking into account the circumstances and the tax rates at the
    time of entering into the Domination Agreement, the net
    guaranteed annual payment was €2.89 per share for a
    full fiscal year. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004, a charge
    of €3 million ($4 million), €19 million
    ($22 million) and €6 million ($8 million),
    respectively, was recorded in Other income (expense), net for
    the anticipated guaranteed payment. The remaining liability at
    December 31, 2006 to be paid in 2007 for CAG’s 2006
    fiscal year is €3 million ($3 million).

On June 1, 2006, the guaranteed dividend for the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2005, which amounted to
    €3 million, was paid. In addition, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement entered into with plaintiff shareholders in
    March 2006, the Purchaser paid €1 million on
    June 30, 2006, the guaranteed dividend for the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2006, to those shareholders who signed
    a letter waiving any further rights with respect to such
    guaranteed dividend that ordinarily would become due and payable
    after the 2007 annual general meeting. Between June 30,
    2006, and January 17, 2007, the Purchaser paid a total
    amount of less than €1 million to minority
    shareholders who required early payment of the guaranteed
    dividend for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, by
    submitting such waiver letter after June 30, 2006.

On January 17, 2007, the Purchaser made, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement entered into with plaintiff shareholders in
    December 2006, the following guaranteed dividend payments:
    (i) a total amount of €1 million was paid to all
    minority shareholders who had not yet requested early payment of
    the guaranteed dividend for the fiscal year ended on
    September 30, 2006, and (ii) a total amount of
    €1 million representing the pro rata share of the
    guaranteed dividend for the first five months of the fiscal year
    ending September 30, 2007 was paid to all minority
    shareholders.

Beginning October 1, 2004, under the terms of the
    Domination Agreement, the Purchaser, as the dominating entity,
    among other things, is required to compensate CAG for any
    statutory annual loss incurred by CAG, the dominated entity, on
    a non-consolidated basis, at the end of the fiscal year when the
    loss was incurred. This obligation to compensate CAG for annual
    losses will apply during the entire term of the Domination
    Agreement. The Purchaser has not had to compensate CAG for an
    annual loss for any period during which the Domination Agreement
    has been in effect.

The Domination Agreement is subject to legal challenges
    instituted by dissenting shareholders. During August 2004, ten
    actions were brought by minority shareholders against CAG in the
    Frankfurt District Court, all of which were consolidated in
    September 2004. Several minority shareholders joined these
    proceedings via a third party intervention in support of the
    plaintiffs. The Purchaser joined the proceedings via a third
    party intervention in support of CAG. Among other things, these
    actions requested the court to set aside shareholder resolutions
    passed at the extraordinary general meeting held on
    July 30-31, 2004 based on allegations that include the
    alleged violation of procedural requirements and information
    rights of the shareholders. On March 6, 2006, the Purchaser
    and CAG signed a settlement agreement settling the ten minority
    shareholder actions (See Note 25).

Twenty-seven minority shareholders filed lawsuits in May and
    June of 2005 in the Frankfurt District Court contesting the
    shareholder resolutions passed at the annual general meeting
    held May

19-20,

2005,
    which confirmed the resolutions passed at the

July 30-31,

2004 extraordinary general meeting approving the Domination
    Agreement and a change in CAG’s fiscal year. In conjunction
    with the Purchaser’s acquisition of 5.9 million
    ordinary shares of CAG from two shareholders in August 2005, two
    of those lawsuits were withdrawn. In February 2006, the
    Frankfurt District Court ruled to dismiss all challenges
    contesting the confirmatory resolutions and upheld only the
    challenge regarding the ratification of the acts of the members
    of the board of management and the supervisory board. CAG
    appealed the decision with respect to the ratification. Three
    plaintiff shareholders appealed the decision on the confirmatory
    resolutions, however, two plaintiff shareholders agreed in a
    settlement agreement to withdraw their actions.

F-10


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Domination Agreement is further challenged in four Null and
    Void actions pending in the Frankfurt District Court. These
    actions are seeking to have the shareholders’ resolution
    approving the Domination Agreement declared null and void based
    on an alleged violation of formal requirements relating to the
    invitation for the shareholders’ meeting.

If legal challenges of the Domination Agreement by dissenting
    shareholders of CAG are successful, some or all actions taken
    under the Domination Agreement, including the transfer of CAC
    (see

Organizational Restructuring

below for discussion
    regarding CAC’s transfer) may be required to be reversed
    and the Company may be required to compensate CAG for damages
    caused by such actions, which could have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

The amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement are under
    court review in special award proceedings (See Note 25). As
    a result of these proceedings, either amount could be increased
    by the court so that all minority shareholders, including those
    who have already tendered their shares into the mandatory offer
    and have received the fair cash compensation could claim the
    respective higher amounts. Minority shareholders may initiate
    such proceedings also with respect to the Squeeze-Out
    compensation. In this case, shareholders who cease to be
    shareholders of CAG due to the Squeeze-Out are entitled,
    pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Purchaser and
    minority shareholders, to claim for their shares the higher of
    the compensation amounts determined by the court in these
    different proceedings. Payments they already received as
    compensation for their shares will be offset so that the
    minority shareholders who cease to be shareholders of CAG due to
    the Squeeze-Out are not entitled to more than the higher of the
    amount set in the two court proceedings.

Organizational
    Restructuring

In October 2004, Celanese and certain of its subsidiaries
    completed an organizational restructuring (the
    “Organizational Restructuring”) pursuant to which the
    Purchaser effected, by giving a corresponding instruction under
    the Domination Agreement, the transfer of all of the shares of
    CAC from Celanese Holding GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of
    CAG, to Celanese Caylux Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A., formerly BCP
    Caylux Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A (“Celanese Caylux”),
    which resulted in Celanese Caylux owning 100% of the equity of
    CAC and indirectly, all of its assets, including subsidiary
    stock. This transfer was affected by CAG selling all outstanding
    shares in CAC for a €291 million note. This note
    eliminates in consolidation.

Following the transfer of CAC to Celanese Caylux,
    (1) Celanese Holdings contributed substantially all of its
    assets and liabilities (including all outstanding capital stock
    of Celanese Caylux) to BCP Crystal in exchange for all
    outstanding capital stock of BCP Crystal and (2) BCP
    Crystal assumed certain obligations of Celanese Caylux,
    including all rights and obligations of Celanese Caylux under
    the senior credit facilities, the floating rate term loan and
    the senior subordinated notes. BCP Crystal, at its discretion,
    may subsequently cause the liquidation of Celanese Caylux.

As a result of these transactions, BCP Crystal holds 100% of
    CAC’s equity and, indirectly, all equity owned by CAC and
    its subsidiaries. In addition, BCP Crystal holds, indirectly,
    all of the CAG shares held by the Purchaser and all of the
    wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee Celanese
    Caylux’s obligations under the senior credit facilities to
    guarantee the senior subordinated notes issued on June 8,
    2004 and July 1, 2004 (See Note 16) on an
    unsecured senior subordinated basis.

Acquisition
    of Additional CAG Shares

On August 24, 2005, the Company acquired 5.9 million,
    or approximately 12%, of the outstanding CAG shares from two
    shareholders for €302 million ($369 million). The
    Company also paid to such shareholders €12 million
    ($15 million) in consideration for the settlement of
    certain claims and for such shareholders agreeing to, among
    other things, (1) accept the shareholders’ resolutions
    passed at the extraordinary general meeting of CAG held on

    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

July 30 and 31, 2004 and the annual general meeting of
    CAG held on May 19 and 20, 2005, (2) acknowledge the
    legal effectiveness of the Domination Agreement,
    (3) irrevocably withdraw and abandon all actions,
    applications and appeals each brought or joined in legal
    proceedings related to, among other things, challenging the
    effectiveness of the Domination Agreement and amount of fair
    cash compensation offered by the Purchaser in the mandatory
    offer required by Section 305(1) of the German Stock
    Corporation Act, (4) refrain from acquiring any CAG shares
    or any other investment in CAG, and (5) refrain from taking
    any future legal action with respect to shareholder resolutions
    or corporate actions of CAG. The Purchaser paid the aggregate
    consideration of €314 million ($384 million) for
    the additional CAG shares using available cash.

During the year ended December 31, 2005 and the nine months
    ended December 31, 2004, the Purchaser acquired additional
    CAG shares for $473 million and $33 million,
    respectively, including direct acquisition costs of
    $4 million and less than $1 million, respectively. The
    additional CAG shares were acquired pursuant to either
    i) the mandatory offer or ii) the acquisition of
    additional CAG shares as described below.

Upon the acquisition of the additional CAG shares during the
    second half of 2005, the assets and liabilities of CAG were
    adjusted in the consolidated financial statements to fair value
    for the additional 14% acquired. The primary amounts allocated
    to assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the
    additional ownership percentage acquired resulted in an increase
    in inventory of $8 million, which was subsequently charged
    to cost of goods sold, an increase in property, plant and
    equipment of $15 million, an increase in intangible assets
    of $65 million and a decrease in goodwill of
    $54 million, attributable to the carrying value of the
    minority interest acquired being greater than the price paid.

Pro
    Forma Information

The following pro forma information for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 was prepared as if the
    Acquisition and the subsequent acquisition of additional CAG
    shares during 2005 had occurred as of the beginning of such
    period:

Pro forma adjustments include (1) adjustments for purchase
    accounting, including (i) the application of purchase
    accounting to pension and other postretirement obligations and
    (ii) the application of purchase accounting to property,
    plant and equipment and intangible assets, (2) adjustments
    for items directly related to the transaction, including
    (i) the impact of the additional pension contribution,
    (ii) the Advisor monitoring fee (See Note 28),
    (iii) fees incurred by the Company related to the
    Acquisition, and (iv) adjustments to interest expense to
    reflect the Company’s capital structure as a result of the
    Acquisition including the reversal of $89 million of
    accelerated amortization expense of deferred financing costs
    recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004, and
    (3) corresponding adjustments to income tax expense.

The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the
    results that would have occurred had the Acquisition occurred as
    of the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily
    indicative of future results.

Squeeze-Out

On May 30, 2006, CAG’s shareholders’ meeting
    approved a transfer to the Purchaser of all shares owned by
    minority shareholders against payment of cash compensation in
    the amount of €66.99 per share (the
    “Squeeze-Out”). The Squeeze-Out was registered in the
    commercial register on December 22, 2006, after several
    lawsuits by

Initial
    Public Offering and Concurrent Financings

In January 2005, the Company completed an initial public
    offering of 50,000,000 shares of Series A common stock
    and received net proceeds of $752 million after deducting
    underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses of
    $48 million. Concurrently, the Company received net
    proceeds of $233 million from the offering of its
    convertible perpetual preferred stock. A portion of the proceeds
    of the share offerings were used to redeem $188 million of
    senior discount notes and $521 million of senior
    subordinated notes, excluding early redemption premiums of
    $19 million and $51 million, respectively.

Subsequent to the closing of the initial public offering, the
    Company borrowed an additional $1,135 million under the
    amended and restated senior credit facilities, a portion of
    which was used to repay a $350 million floating rate term
    loan, which excludes a $4 million early redemption premium,
    and $200 million of which was used as the primary financing
    for the February 2005 acquisition of Vinamul (See Notes 6
    and 16). Additionally, the amended and restated senior credit
    facilities included a $242 million delayed draw term loan,
    which expired unutilized in July 2005.

On March 9, 2005, the Company issued a 7,500,000
    Series A common stock dividend to the Original Shareholders
    (See Note 19) of its Series B common stock.

On April 7, 2005, the Company used the remaining proceeds
    of the initial public offering and concurrent financings to pay
    a special cash dividend declared on March 8, 2005 to
    holders of the Company’s Series B common stock of
    $804 million. Upon payment of the $804 million
    dividend, all of the outstanding shares of Series B common
    stock converted automatically to shares of Series A common
    stock.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

•
    Consolidation principles

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for all periods
    presented and include the accounts of the Company and its
    majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises
    control as well as variable interest entities where the Company
    is deemed the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

•
    Estimates and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated
    charges during the reporting period. Significant estimates
    pertain to purchase price allocations, impairments of intangible
    assets and other long-lived assets, restructuring costs and
    other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other
    postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations,
    environmental liabilities, and loss contingencies, among others.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

•
    Cash and cash equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered cash equivalents.

•
    Restricted Cash

At December 31, 2006, the Company has $46 million of
    restricted cash. This cash is for the payment associated with
    the settlement agreement entered into with the plaintiff
    shareholders in December 2006 and was paid in January 2007.

•
    Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost includes raw
    materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Stores and
    supplies are valued at cost or market, whichever is lower. Cost
    is generally determined by the average cost method.

Upon completion of the Acquisition, the Predecessor changed its
    inventory valuation method of accounting for its
    U.S. subsidiaries from the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method to the FIFO method to be
    consistent with the Successor’s accounting policy. This
    change more closely represents the physical flow of goods
    resulting in ending inventory which better represents the
    current cost of the inventory and the costs in income more
    closely matches the flow of goods. The financial statements of
    the Predecessor have been adjusted for all periods presented to
    reflect this change. The impact of this change on the
    Predecessor’s reported net earnings and earnings per share
    for the three months ended March 31, 2004 is as follows:

•
    Investments in marketable securities

The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity
    securities as “available-for-sale” and reports those
    investments at their fair or market values in the balance sheet
    as Other assets. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the related
    tax effect on

available-for-sale

securities, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
    component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    until realized. The cost of securities sold is determined by
    using the specific identification method.

A decline in the market value of any

available-for-sale

security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary
    results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The
    impairment is charged to earnings and a

F-14


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

new cost basis for the security is established. To determine
    whether an impairment is

other-than-temporary,

the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to
    hold the investment until a market price recovery and evidence
    indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs
    evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment
    includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and
    duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to
    year-end, and forecasted performance of the investee.

•
    Investments and equity in net earnings of
    affiliates

Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments
    in Common Stock

, stipulates that the equity method should be
    used to account for investments whereby an investor has
    ”the ability to exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of an investee”, but does
    not exercise control. APB Opinion No. 18 generally
    considers an investor to have the ability to exercise
    significant influence when it owns 20% or more of the voting
    stock of an investee. FASB Interpretation No. 35,

Criteria for Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for
    Investments in Common Stock

, which was issued to clarify the
    criteria for applying the equity method of accounting to 50% or
    less owned companies, lists circumstances under which, despite
    20% ownership, an investor may not be able to exercise
    significant influence. Certain investments where the Company
    owns greater than a 20% ownership and can not exercise
    significant influence or control are accounted for under the
    cost method (See Note 10).

•
    Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are capitalized at cost.
    Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, generally
    over the following estimated useful lives of the assets.

Land Improvements

20 years

Buildings and Building Improvements

30 years

Machinery and Equipment

20 years

Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their
    fair values and depreciated over the assets’ remaining
    useful lives or the Company’s policy lives, whichever is
    shorter. Effective January 1, 2005, the Company revised the
    estimated useful lives of certain assets purchased subsequent to
    that date. The asset depreciation lives of machinery and
    equipment that were previously ten years were increased to
    twenty years and the useful lives of buildings and building
    improvements increased from ten to thirty years. The impact of
    the change in estimated useful lives was a $9 million
    reduction in depreciation expense during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 and an increase to net income of
    $8 million during the same period.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over ten years or the
    remaining life of the respective lease considering renewals that
    are reasonably assured, whichever is shorter.

Repair and maintenance costs, including costs for planned
    maintenance turnarounds, that do not extend the useful life of
    the asset are charged against earnings as incurred. Major
    replacements, renewals and significant improvements are
    capitalized.

Interest costs incurred during the construction period of assets
    are applied to the average value of constructed assets using the
    estimated weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings
    outstanding during the construction period. The interest
    capitalized is amortized over the life of the asset.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment

—
    The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
    not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
    and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
    an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to
    be generated by the asset. If assets are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
    amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the
    fair value of the assets. The estimate of fair value may be

F-15


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determined as the amount at which the asset could be bought or
    sold in a current transaction between willing parties. If this
    information is not available, fair value is determined based on
    the best information available in the circumstances. This
    frequently involves the use of a valuation technique including
    the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at a
    rate commensurate with the risk involved, or other acceptable
    valuation techniques. Impairment of property, plant and
    equipment to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner,
    except that fair value is reduced by the costs to dispose of the
    assets (See Note 11).

•
    Goodwill and other intangible assets

Patents, customer related intangible assets and other
    intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated economic lives. The weighted average
    amortization period is 8.5 years. The excess of the
    purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business (“goodwill”) and
    other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
    amortized, but rather tested for impairment, at least annually.
    The Company tests for goodwill impairment during the third
    quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances.

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible
    assets

— The Company assesses the recoverability
    of the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible
    assets with indefinite useful lives annually or whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of
    goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level based on a
    two-step approach. First, the carrying amount of the reporting
    unit is compared to the fair value as estimated by the future
    net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
    reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying value of the
    reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a
    second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit’s
    assets and liabilities are fair valued. To the extent that the
    reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its
    implied fair value of goodwill, impairment exists and must be
    recognized. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as
    the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the fair value
    of all non-goodwill assets and liabilities allocated to the
    reporting unit. The estimate of fair value may be determined as
    the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a
    current transaction between willing parties. If this information
    is not available, fair value is determined based on the best
    information available in the circumstances. This frequently
    involves the use of a valuation technique including the present
    value of expected future cash flows, discounted at a rate
    commensurate with the risk involved, or other acceptable
    valuation techniques.

Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful
    lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the
    intangible assets to the fair value of the respective intangible
    assets. Any excess of the carrying value of the intangible
    assets over the fair value of the intangible assets is
    recognized as an impairment loss. The estimate of fair value is
    determined similar to that for goodwill outlined above.

The Company assesses the recoverability of intangible assets
    with finite lives in the same manner as for property, plant and
    equipment. See “Impairment of property, plant and
    equipment”.

•
    Financial instruments

The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a
    controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
    derivative financial instruments (See Note 24). As a matter
    of principle, the Company does not use derivative financial
    instruments for trading purposes. The Company has been party to
    interest rate swaps as well as foreign currency forward
    contracts in the management of its interest rate and foreign
    currency exchange rate exposures. The Company generally utilizes
    interest rate derivative contracts in order to fix or limit the
    interest paid on existing variable rate debt. The Company
    utilizes foreign currency derivative financial instruments to
    eliminate or reduce the exposure of its foreign currency
    denominated receivables and payables, which includes the
    Company’s exposure on its dollar denominated intercompany
    net receivables and payables held by euro denominated entities.
    Additionally, the Company has utilized derivative instruments to
    reduce the exposure of its commodity prices. The Company also
    uses derivative and non-derivative financial instruments that
    may give rise to

F-16


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

foreign currency transaction gains or losses, to hedge the
    foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign
    operation.

The Company’s risk management policy for the majority of
    its commodity raw material requirements allows entering into
    supply agreements and forward purchase or swap contracts.
    Financial instruments which could potentially subject the
    Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily
    receivables concentrated in various geographic locations and
    cash equivalents. The Company performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition.
    Generally, collateral is not required from customers. Allowances
    are provided for specific risks inherent in receivables.

•
    Deferred financing costs

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred to obtain debt
    financings and amortizes these costs using the straight-line
    method over the terms of the related debt. Upon the
    extinguishment of the related debt, any unamortized capitalized
    debt financing costs are immediately expensed. For the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004, the Successor recorded amortization of
    deferred financing costs, which is classified in Interest
    expense, of $13 million, $41 million and
    $98 million, respectively, of which $1 million,
    $28 million and $89 million, respectively, related to
    accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    $58 million and $73 million of net deferred financing
    costs included within long term other assets.

•
    Environmental liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical
    products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the
    production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling,
    processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials.
    The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating
    to environmental matters if available information indicates that
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss is reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the
    site, the Company accrues through time horizons of ten to
    fifteen years, unless the Company has government orders or other
    agreements that extend beyond these time horizons. All other
    fees are expensed as incurred. If the event of loss is neither
    probable nor reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible,
    the Company provides appropriate disclosure in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements if the contingency is
    considered material. The Company estimates environmental
    liabilities on a

case-by-case

basis using the most current status of available facts, existing
    technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior
    experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Environmental
    liabilities for which the remediation period is fixed and
    associated costs are readily determinable are recorded at their
    net present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from other
    parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed
    probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated
    site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of
    the following types of costs: site investigation and testing
    costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water
    contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation
    monitoring costs. These reserves do not take into account any
    claims or recoveries from insurance. There are no pending
    insurance claims for any environmental liability that are
    expected to be material. The measurement of environmental
    liabilities is based on the Company’s periodic estimate of
    what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the
    remediation effort. The Company uses its best estimate to
    establish its environmental reserves. The Company utilizes third
    parties to assist in the management and development of cost
    estimates for its sites. Changes to environmental regulations or
    other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected
    in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which
    they occur (See Note 18).

•
    Legal Fees

The Company accrues for legal fees related to loss contingency
    matters when the costs associated with defending these matters
    can be reasonably estimated and are probable of occurring. All
    other legal fees are expensed as incurred.

•
    Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have
    been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment of products, and provided that four basic criterion are
    met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and
    (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Should changes in
    conditions cause the Company to determine revenue recognition
    criteria are not met for certain transactions, revenue
    recognition would be delayed until such time that the
    transactions become realizable and fully earned. Payments
    received in advance of meeting the above revenue recognition
    criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.

•
    Stock-based compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Successor adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The
    Successor has elected the modified prospective transition method
    as permitted by SFAS No. 123(R) and, accordingly,
    prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Under this transition method,
    compensation cost recognized includes: (i) compensation
    cost for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
    vested as of, January 1, 2006 (based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 and previously presented in the pro forma
    footnote disclosures), and (ii) compensation cost for all
    stock-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006
    (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the new provisions of SFAS No. 123(R)).

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”), the Successor accounted
    for employee stock-based compensation for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 in accordance with APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”), using an intrinsic value
    approach to measure compensation expense, if any.

For the three months ended March 31, 2004, the Predecessor
    accounted for stock options and similar equity instruments under
    the fair value method, which requires compensation cost to be
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the award. The
    fair value of stock options is determined using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account the
    stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected
    life of the option, the volatility and the expected dividends of
    the underlying stock, and the risk-free interest rate over the
    expected life of the option. Compensation expense based on the
    fair value of stock options is recorded over the vesting period
    of the options and has been recognized in the Predecessor’s
    consolidated financial statements. The CAG stock options did not
    contain change in control provisions, which would have resulted
    in accelerated vesting, as a result of the Acquisition (See
    Note 22).

•
    Research and development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense
    in the period in which they are incurred.

•
    Insurance loss reserves

The Company has two wholly owned insurance companies (the
    “Captives”) that are used as a form of self insurance
    for property, liability and workers compensation risks. One of
    the Captives also insures certain third party risks. The
    liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated
    risk of loss which is based on management estimates and
    actuarial valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the
    portion of the third party premiums written applicable to the
    unexpired terms of the policies in-force. Liabilities are
    recognized for known claims when

F-18


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

sufficient information has been developed to indicate
    involvement of a specific policy and the Company can reasonably
    estimate its liability. In addition, liabilities have been
    established to cover additional exposure on both known and
    unasserted claims. Estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and
    updated regularly. It is possible that actual results could
    differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Premiums
    written are recognized as revenue based on the terms of the
    policies. Capitalization of the Captives is determined by
    regulatory guidelines. Total assets and liabilities for the
    Captives after elimination of all intercompany activity was
    $339 million and $171 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2006 and $386 million and
    $238 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005.
    Included in total liabilities are third party reserves of
    $24 million and $31 million at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Third party premiums were
    $22 million, $23 million, $29 million and
    $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the three
    months ended March 31, 2004, respectively.

•
    Reinsurance receivables

The Captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their
    risk of loss. The reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the
    Captives from their obligations to policyholders. Failure of the
    reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to
    the Captives. The Captives evaluate the financial condition of
    their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to
    minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
    insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed
    non-collectible.

•
    Income taxes

The provision for income taxes has been determined using the
    asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
    Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
    effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
    amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and
    tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these
    temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are
    expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or
    the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and
    laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the
    balance sheet date.

The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized.

    Olefin KG, Frankfurt Am Main (“CPO”), a subsidiary of
    the Company, acts as a purchasing agent on behalf of the
    Company, as well as third parties. CPO arranges sale and
    purchase agreements for raw materials on a commission basis.
    Accordingly, the commissions earned on these third party sales
    are classified as a reduction to Selling, general and
    administrative expense. Commissions amounted to $5 million,
    $9 million, $6 million and $2 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months
    ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, respectively. The raw material sales volume
    commissioned by CPO for third parties amounted to
    $937 million, $880 million, $512 million and
    $149 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the three
    months ended March 31, 2004, respectively.

•
    Functional and reporting currencies

For the Company’s international operations where the
    functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, assets
    and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates,
    while the statement of operations amounts are translated using
    the average exchange rates for the respective period.
    Differences arising from the translation of assets and
    liabilities in comparison with the translation of the previous
    periods or from initial recognition during the period are
    included as a separate component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net.

As a result of the Purchaser’s acquisition of voting
    control of CAG, the Predecessor financial statements are
    reported in U.S. dollars to be consistent with
    Successor’s reporting requirements. For CAG reporting
    requirements, the euro was the reporting currency.

•
    Reclassifications

The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to
    conform to current year’s presentation. The
    reclassifications had no effect on the consolidated statements
    of operations, of cash flows or of shareholders’ equity as
    previously reported.

•
    Cash flows from discontinued operations

In 2005, the Company revised its presentation of cash flows
    related to discontinued operations. The cash flows of continuing
    operations and discontinued operations are presented together,
    with separate captions for the operating, investing and
    financing activities of discontinued operations. In periods
    prior to 2005, the Company presented the cash flows of
    discontinued operations within certain captions of operating,
    investing and financing cash flows together with those of
    continuing operations. Accordingly, the category totals for
    operating, investing and financing activities were not impacted
    by this revision.

Recent
    accounting pronouncements

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs, amendment to ARB No. 43
    Chapter 4

, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal
    amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
    wasted material and requires that such items be recognized as
    current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the

F-20


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“so abnormal” criterion outlined in ARB No. 43.
    SFAS No. 151 also introduces the concept of
    “normal capacity” and requires the allocation of fixed
    production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity
    of the production facilities. Unallocated overheads must be
    recognized as an expense in the period incurred. The Company
    adopted SFAS No. 151 effective January 1, 2006.
    The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

, which requires
    that the cost from all share-based payment transactions be
    recognized in the financial statements.
    SFAS No. 123(R),

Share Based Payment

,
    (“SFAS No. 123(R)”) requires companies to
    measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a
    fair-value method and record such expense in their consolidated
    financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects
    and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects
    resulting from share-based payment arrangements. Prior to
    January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock-based
    compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles
    Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees

(“APB 25”) and related
    interpretations. Under APB 25, no compensation expense was
    recognized for stock option grants if the exercise price of the
    Company’s stock option grants was at or above the fair
    market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) using
    the modified-prospective transition method. Under this
    transition method, compensation cost recognized includes:
    (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant-date fair value used for pro forma disclosures
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
    (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not
    been restated. See Note 22 for additional information
    related to the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion
    No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

(“SFAS No. 153”). The amendments made by
    SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges
    of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value
    of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the
    narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
    assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of
    nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The
    Company adopted SFAS No. 153 effective January 1,
    2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

(“SFAS No. 155”). SFAS No. 155
    amends FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Statement
    No. 140, and improves the financial reporting of certain
    hybrid financial instruments by requiring more consistent
    accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a means to
    simplify the accounting for these instruments. Specifically,
    SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that have
    embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating
    the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the
    holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair
    value basis. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of
    SFAS No. 155, as applicable, beginning in fiscal year
    2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(“SFAS No. 158”), which requires an
    employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a
    defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in
    its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in
    that funded status in the year in which the changes occur
    through comprehensive income. This statement also requires an
    employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date
    of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited
    exceptions. The Company has adopted the requirements of
    SFAS No. 158 and has properly reflected them in the
    consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 for
    additional information.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (SAB) Topic 1N,

Financial Statements — Considering
    the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 addresses how the
    effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should be taken
    into consideration when quantifying misstatements in
    current-year financial statements. It requires quantification of
    misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement
    approaches and evaluation of whether either approach results in
    quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant
    quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 does not
    change the SEC’s previous guidance on evaluating the
    materiality of misstatements. When the effect of initial
    adoption is determined to be material, the guidance allows
    registrants to record that effect as a cumulative-effect
    adjustment to

beginning-of-year

retained earnings. The requirements are effective for annual
    financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after
    November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that the
    Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a
    tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being
    sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related
    appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits
    of the position. The Company is required to adopt the provisions
    of FIN 48, as applicable, beginning in fiscal year 2007,
    with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
    recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    FIN 48 on the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted,
    provided the Company has not yet issued financial statements,
    including interim periods, for that fiscal year. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 157 on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

On February 15, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(“SFAS No. 159”). This
    standard permits companies to choose to measure many financial
    assets and liabilities and certain other items at fair value. A
    company will report unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be applied
    on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, with several exceptions, such as those investments
    accounted for by the equity method, and once elected, the option
    is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. The fair value
    option can be applied only to entire instruments and not to
    portions thereof. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the
    beginning of a company’s first fiscal year beginning after
    November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the
    beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the company
    makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year
    and also elects to apply the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157

.

The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

Acquisitions,
    divestitures and ventures

Acquisitions:

•

On April 6, 2004, the Company acquired 84% of CAG. During
    2005, the Company acquired an additional 14% of CAG (See
    Note 2). As a result of the effective registration of the
    Squeeze-Out in the commercial register in December 2006, the
    Company acquired the remaining 2% of CAG in January 2007.

•

In February 2005, the Company acquired Vinamul, the North
    American and European emulsion polymer business of Imperial
    Chemical Industries PLC (“ICI”) for $208 million,
    in addition to direct acquisition costs of $9 million.
    Vinamul operates manufacturing facilities in the United States,
    Canada, the United Kingdom,

and the Netherlands. As part of the agreement, ICI will continue
    to supply Vinamul with starch, dextrin and other specialty
    ingredients following the acquisition. The Company will supply
    ICI with vinyl acetate monomer and polyvinyl alcohols. The
    supply agreements are for fifteen years, and the pricing is
    based on market and other negotiated terms. The fair value of
    the supply contract was approximately $11 million and was
    recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the fifteen
    year life of the agreement. The Company primarily financed this
    acquisition through borrowings of $200 million under the
    amended and restated senior credit facilities (See
    Note 16). Pro forma financial information has not been
    provided as the acquisition did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s results of operations.

•

In July 2005, the Company acquired Acetex Corporation
    (“Acetex”) for $270 million, in addition to
    direct acquisition costs of $16 million and assumed
    Acetex’s $247 million of debt, which is net of cash
    acquired of $54 million. Acetex has two primary
    businesses — its Acetyls business and its Specialty
    Polymers and Films business. The Acetyls business is operated in
    Europe and the Polymers and Film businesses are operated in
    North America. The Company acquired Acetex using existing cash.
    Pro forma financial information has not been provided as the
    acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company’s

In August 2006, the Company signed a definitive agreement to
    purchase the cellulose acetate flake, tow and film business of
    Acetate Products Limited for a purchase price of approximately
    £57 million ($110 million), subject to certain
    adjustments as defined in the agreement. The transaction closed
    on January 31, 2007. See Note 32 for further
    information.

Ventures:

•

In August 2005, the Company and Hatco Corporation agreed to wind
    up Estech GmbH, its venture for neopropyl esters. The Company
    recorded an impairment charge of $10 million, included in
    Equity in net earnings of affiliates, related to this matter in
    the year ended December 31, 2005.

•

In April 2004, the Company and a group of investors led by
    Conduit Ventures Ltd. entered into a venture, which was named
    Pemeas GmbH. This venture was formed in order to advance the
    commercialization of the Company’s fuel cell technology.
    Pemeas GmbH was considered a variable interest entity as defined
    under FIN No. 46. The Company was deemed the primary
    beneficiary of this variable interest entity and, accordingly,
    consolidated this entity in its consolidated financial
    statements. In the period the Company adopted
    FIN No. 46, the consolidation of this entity did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial position
    or results of operations and cash flows. In December 2005, the
    Company sold its common stock interest in Pemeas GmbH, which
    resulted in the Company no longer being the primary beneficiary.

On October 1, 2003, Celanese AG and Degussa AG
    (“Degussa”) completed the combination of their
    European oxo businesses. The venture, European Oxo GmbH
    (“EOXO”), consists of both companies’
    propylene-based oxo chemical activities. CAG contributed net
    assets with a carrying value of $12 million for a 50%
    interest in the venture. CAG retained substantially all the
    accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities of
    its contributed business existing on September 30, 2003. In
    addition, CAG and Degussa each committed to fund the venture
    equally. Under a multi-year agreement, Degussa has the option to
    sell its share in EOXO to the Company beginning in January 2008
    for a price based on a formula which considers the profitability
    and net debt of the venture and the purchase price of rhodium.
    On August 28, 2006, Celanese Chemicals Europe GmbH
    (“CCE”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAG, entered
    into an agreement with Degussa pursuant to which Degussa granted
    CCE an option to purchase Degussa’s interest in EOXO for a
    purchase price not materially different than the previously
    described formula and the assumption of certain liabilities. The
    option is exercisable until June 30, 2007 and is subject to
    certain conditions. Degussa has given notice that if CCE does
    not exercise its option to purchase by June 30, 2007,
    Degussa will exercise its right to sell its interest in EOXO to
    the Company beginning in 2008 for a price based on the
    aforementioned formula. In connection with the sale of the
    Company’s oxo products and derivatives business, the
    Company anticipates giving notice to Degussa that it will
    exercise the option, subject to certain conditions, to purchase
    their 50% interest, which will be subsequently sold to Advent
    International (See Note 32). The Company’s European
    oxo business is part of its Chemical Products segment. The
    Company reports its investment in EOXO using the equity method
    of accounting.

Cost investments where the Company owns greater than a 20%
    ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of
    accounting because the Company cannot exercise significant
    influence over these entities. The Company determined that it
    cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to
    local government investment in and influence over these
    entities, limitations on the Company’s involvement in the

day-to-day

operations and the present inability of the entities to provide

The adjustments recorded during the year ended December 31,
    2006 related to CAG consist primarily of reversals of certain
    pre-acquisition tax valuation allowances and resolution of
    uncertainties.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
    decreased Goodwill by $26 million as a result of purchase
    accounting adjustments related to the Acquisition and the
    acquisition of additional CAG shares. Included in this
    adjustment is a $23 million increase to goodwill, and a
    corresponding increase to the Company’s minority interest
    liability primarily associated with the Organizational
    Restructuring that occurred in October 2004 (See Note 2).
    The Company also increased Goodwill by $5 million, net, for
    various purchase accounting adjustments related to the original
    acquisition of CAG shares. As these represented immaterial
    adjustments, individually and in the aggregate, prior periods
    have not been restated. Also included in this adjustment is a
    $54 million decrease to goodwill associated with the
    additional CAG shares purchased based on the fair value of the
    assets and liabilities acquired (See Note 2).

    Company’s trademarks and tradenames have an indefinite
    life. Accordingly, no amortization is recorded on these
    intangible assets.

In connection with the acquisition of Vinamul and Acetex, the
    Company identified intangible assets with an estimated value of
    $84 million, which were comprised primarily of customer
    related intangible assets. Additionally, Intangible assets, net
    increased by $65 million as a result of purchase accounting
    allocations related to the additional CAG shares purchased
    during 2005 (See Note 2).

In connection with the acquisition of Vinamul, the Company
    entered into a five-year non-compete agreement with ICI. The
    Company has assigned a fair value of $10 million to this
    agreement.

As a result of the Company’s annual impairment test on
    intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, the Company
    recorded an impairment loss of $2 million for the year

Relates to sale of the Rock Hill plant (See Note 6).

The Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement
    obligations related to most of its existing operating
    facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include
    demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration
    activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the
    retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or
    abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company
    currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities
    indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value
    cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company
    considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites,
    an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time.
    If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset
    retirement obligations could significantly affect the
    Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

Senior Credit Facilities.

As of
    December 31, 2006, the amended and restated (January
    2005) senior credit facilities consist of a term loan
    facility, a revolving credit facility and a credit-linked
    revolving facility. The

F-33


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

revolving credit facility, through a syndication of banks,
    provides for borrowings of up to $600 million, including
    the availability of letters of credit in U.S. dollars and
    euros and for borrowings on

same-day

notice. As of December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding
    borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
    credit facility; accordingly $600 million remained
    available for borrowing.

At December 31, 2006, the term loan facility includes
    $1,288 million of U.S. dollar denominated loans and
    €253 million of euro denominated loans, both maturing
    in 2011.

In addition, the Company has a $228 million credit-linked
    revolving facility, which matures in 2009. The credit-linked
    revolving facility includes borrowing capacity available for
    letters of credit. As of December 31, 2006, there were
    $218 million of letters of credit issued under the
    credit-linked revolving facility and $10 million remained
    available for borrowing.

Substantially all of the assets of Celanese Holdings LLC
    (“Celanese Holdings”), the direct parent of
    BCP Crystal US Holdings Corp. (“BCP Crystal”),
    and, subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of its
    existing and future U.S. subsidiaries, referred to as
    U.S. Guarantors, secure these facilities. The borrowings
    under the revolving senior credit facility bear interest at a
    rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrower’s
    option, either a base rate or a LIBOR rate. The applicable
    margin for a revolving facility borrowing under the base rate
    option is 1.50% and for the LIBOR option, 2.50% (in each case,
    subject to a step-down based on a performance test, as defined).
    In November 2005, the Company amended its senior credit
    facilities which lowered the margin over LIBOR on the
    U.S. dollar denominated portion of the term loan facility
    from 2.25% to 2.00%. In addition, a further reduction of the
    interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.75% is allowed if certain
    conditions are met. The interest rate for the revolving senior
    credit facility at December 31, 2006 was 7.61%.

BCP Crystal may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the
    senior credit facility at any time without premium or penalty,
    other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to
    LIBOR loans.

As stated in the prepayment requirements under the amended and
    restated senior credit facilities, the Company is required to
    prepay 50% of its excess cash flow against its senior term loan
    facility. Based on the excess cash flow calculation, as defined
    in the Company’s amended and restated senior credit
    facilities, at December 31, 2006, the Company will make a
    prepayment of approximately $98 million on the senior term
    loan facility in March 2007. In connection with the excess cash
    flow prepayment, the Company will write off approximately
    $1 million of unamortized deferred financing fees
    associated with the senior term loan facility.

In July 2006, the Company made a $100 million equivalent
    voluntary prepayment on its senior term loan facility. In
    connection with the voluntary prepayment, the Company wrote off
    approximately $1 million of unamortized deferred financing
    fees associated with the senior term loan facility.

In the first quarter 2005, the Company borrowed an additional
    $1,135 million under the amended and restated senior credit
    facilities. A portion of these proceeds, coupled with the
    proceeds from the initial public offering, were used to repay
    the senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes, as
    previously described, and the $350 million floating rate
    term loan and related early redemption premiums of
    $4 million, $19 million and $51 million,
    respectively. In addition, $200 million was used to finance
    the February 2005 acquisition of the Vinamul business (See
    Note 6).

Senior Subordinated Notes.

During June and
    July 2004, the Company issued $1,225 million and
    €200 million in senior subordinated notes for proceeds
    of $1,475 million, which included $4 million in
    premiums. All of BCP Crystal’s U.S. domestic, wholly
    owned subsidiaries that guarantee BCP Crystal’s obligations
    under the senior credit facilities guarantee the senior
    subordinated notes on an unsecured senior subordinated basis. In
    February 2005, $521 million of the net proceeds of the
    offering of the Company’s Series A common stock were
    used to redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and
    $51 million was used to pay the premium associated with the
    redemption.

Senior Discount Notes.

In September 2004,
    Crystal LLC and Crystal US Sub 3 Corp., a subsidiary of
    Crystal LLC, issued $853 million aggregate principal
    amount at maturity of the Company’s senior discount notes
    due 2014 consisting of $163 million principal amount at
    maturity of the Company’s 10% Series A senior discount
    notes

due 2014 and $690 million principal amount at maturity of

%
    Series B Senior Discount Notes due 2014 (collectively, the
    “senior discount notes”). The gross proceeds of the
    offering were $513 million. Approximately $500 million
    of the proceeds were distributed to the Company’s Original
    Shareholders (See Note 19), with the remaining proceeds
    used to pay fees associated with the refinancing. Until
    October 1, 2009, interest on the senior discount notes will
    accrue in the form of an increase in the accreted value of such
    notes. Cash interest on the senior discount notes will accrue
    commencing on October 1, 2009 and be payable semiannually
    in arrears on April 1 and October 1. In February 2005,
    the Company used $37 million of the net proceeds of the
    offering of its Series A common stock to redeem a portion
    of the Series A senior discount notes, $151 million to
    redeem a portion of the Series B senior discount notes and
    $19 million to pay the premium associated with such
    redemption.

Mandatorily Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred
    Stock.

In April 2004, the Company issued
    200,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Exchangeable
    Preferred Shares due 2016 for gross proceeds of
    $200 million, exclusive of $18 million of fees. The
    non-voting shares of preferred stock had an initial liquidation
    preference of $1,000 per share and a dividend rate of 13%.
    The Company recorded associated interest expense of
    $6 million for the nine months ended December 31,
    2004. These shares of preferred stock were redeemed on
    July 1, 2004 for $227 million, which included
    $6 million in accrued interest and a redemption premium of
    $21 million. Accordingly, the Company expensed
    $18 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and the
    redemption premium of $21 million, both of which are
    included within interest expense in the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004.

Other Financial Arrangements.

As detailed in
    Note 6, in July 2005, the Company acquired Acetex for
    $270 million and assumed Acetex’s $247 million of
    net debt, which is net of cash acquired of $54 million. The
    Company caused Acetex to exercise its option to redeem its


/


% senior
    notes due 2009 totaling $265 million. The redemption was
    funded primarily with cash on hand. The redemption price was
    $280 million, which represents 105.438% of the outstanding
    principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
    August 19, 2005. On August 25, 2005, the Company
    repaid the remaining $36 million of assumed debt with
    available cash.

Covenants.

The senior credit facilities are
    subject to prepayment requirements and contain covenants,
    defaults and other provisions. The senior credit facilities
    require BCP Crystal to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to
    certain exceptions, with:

— 75% (such percentage will be reduced to 50% if
    BCP Crystal’s leverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 for
    any fiscal year ending on or after December 31,
    2005) of BCP Crystal’s excess cash flow;

— 100% of the net cash proceeds of all
    non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and condemnation
    events, unless BCP Crystal reinvests or contracts to reinvest
    those proceeds in assets to be used in BCP Crystal’s
    business or to make certain other permitted investments within
    12 months, subject to certain limitations;

— 100% of the net cash proceeds of any
    incurrence of debt other than debt permitted under the senior
    credit facilities, subject to certain exceptions; and

— 50% of the net cash proceeds of issuances of
    equity of Celanese Holdings, subject to certain exceptions.

The indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the
    senior discount notes limit the ability of the issuers of such
    notes and the ability of their restricted subsidiaries to:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

•

pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase the
    respective issuer’s capital stock;

•

make investments;

•

enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

•

limit dividends or other payments by BCP Crystal’s
    restricted subsidiaries to it;

•

create liens or other pari passu on subordinated indebtedness
    without securing the respective notes;

•

designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

•

Subject to certain exceptions, the indentures governing the
    senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes permit
    the issuers of the notes and their restricted subsidiaries to
    incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.

In addition, the senior credit facilities require BCP Crystal to
    maintain the following financial covenants: a maximum total
    leverage ratio, a maximum bank debt leverage ratio, a minimum
    interest coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures
    limitation. The maximum consolidated net bank debt to Adjusted
    EBITDA ratio, as defined, previously required under the senior
    credit facilities, was eliminated when the Company amended the
    facilities in January 2005.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with
    all of the financial covenants related to its debt agreements.

Benefit
    Obligations

Pension obligations.

Pension obligations are
    established for benefits payable in the form of retirement,
    disability and surviving dependent pensions. The benefits
    offered vary according to the legal, fiscal and economic
    conditions of each country. The commitments result from
    participation in defined contribution and defined benefit plans,
    primarily in the U.S. Benefits are dependent on years of
    service and the employee’s compensation. Supplemental
    retirement benefits provided to certain employees are
    non-qualified for U.S. tax purposes. Separate trusts have
    been established for some non-qualified plans.

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s U.S. qualified pension plan represented
    greater than 84% and 76% of Celanese’s pension plan assets
    and liabilities, respectively. Independent trusts or insurance
    companies administer the majority of these plans. Pension costs
    under the Company’s retirement plans are actuarially
    determined.

The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North
    America, Europe, and Asia covering certain employees. Employees
    may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these
    contributions in varying amounts. The Company’s matching
    contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on
    specified percentages of employee contributions and aggregated
    $11 million, $12 million, $8 million and
    $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the three
    months ended March 31, 2004, respectively.

In connection with the acquisition of CAG, the Purchaser agreed
    to pre-fund certain pension obligations. The Company contributed
    an additional $54 million to the non-qualified pension
    plan’s rabbi trusts in February 2005.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Vinamul and
    Acetex in 2005, the Company assumed certain assets and
    obligations related to the acquired pension plans. The Company
    recorded liabilities of $128 million for these pension
    plans. Total pension assets acquired amounted to
    $85 million.

As part of a restructuring program announced in October 2004,
    the Company closed certain plants related to its acetate
    filament production and consolidated its acetate flake and tow
    operations from five locations to three. This resulted in the
    reduction of nearly 600 U.S. employees triggering a plan
    curtailment. The curtailment resulted in an increase in the
    projected benefit obligation and a corresponding curtailment
    loss of $1 million for the U.S. pension plan during
    the year ended December 31, 2005.

Other postretirement obligations.

Certain
    retired employees receive postretirement healthcare and life
    insurance benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which
    has the right to modify or terminate these plans at any time.
    The cost for coverage is shared between the Company and the
    employee. The cost of providing retiree health care and life
    insurance benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over
    the service period of the active employee group. The
    company’s policy is to fund benefits as claims and premiums
    are paid. The U.S. plan was closed to new participants
    effective January 1, 2006.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Vinamul and
    Acetex in 2005, the Company assumed certain assets and
    obligations related to the acquired entities’
    postretirement benefit plans. The Company recorded liabilities
    of $24 million for these postretirement benefit plans.

In 2003, the U.S. postretirement medical plan was
    amended to introduce defined dollar caps for

pre-1993

retirees. These changes were approved in June 2003 and resulted
    in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation which was set up as a $67 million negative prior
    service cost base as these changes become effective July 1,
    2004.

Impact of SFAS No. 158.

On
    December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, which caused the
    Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit
    obligations) of its benefit plans in the December 31, 2006
    consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Based
    on the funded status of the defined benefit pension and
    postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2006, the
    Company reported a total unfunded amount of $884 million of
    pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The net impact
    of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 was an increase in pension
    and postretirement benefit obligations of $113 million with
    an offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax. The Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 158 on
    December 31, 2006 had no impact on the Company’s
    earnings. The following tables present details about the

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company uses the corridor approach in the valuation of the
    defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits. The
    corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses
    resulting from variances between actual results and economic
    estimates or actuarial assumptions. For defined benefit pension
    plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when
    the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the
    market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. For other post
    retirement benefits, amortization occurs when the net gains and
    losses exceed 10% of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. The amount in excess of
    the corridor is amortized over the average remaining service
    period to retirement date active plan participants or, for
    retired participants, the average remaining life expectancy.

On January 1, 2005, the Company’s health care cost
    trend assumption for U.S. postretirement medical
    plan’s net periodic benefit cost was 10% per year
    grading down 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. On
    January 1, 2006, the health care cost trend rate was
    9% per year grading down 1% per year to an ultimate
    rate of 5%.

Included in the pension obligations above are accrued
    liabilities relating to supplemental retirement plans for
    certain employees amounting to $232 million and
    $235 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Pension expense relating to these plans included
    in net periodic benefit cost totaled $15 million,
    $15 million, $11 million, and $5 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months
    ended December 31, 2004, and the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, respectively. To fund these obligations,
    non-qualified trusts were established, included within other
    non-current assets, which held marketable securities valued at
    $183 million and $181 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, and recognized income (loss),
    excluding appreciation of insurance contracts, of
    $5 million, $6 million, $6 million and

    holding marketable securities, the non-qualified trust holds
    investments in insurance contracts of $66 million and
    $68 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. In 2005, the Successor contributed $9 million

The financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are
    established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each
    plan’s liability structure. The Company’s asset
    allocation policy is based on a detailed asset/liability
    analysis. In developing investment policy and financial goals,
    consideration is given to the plan’s demographics, the
    returns and risks associated with alternative investment
    strategies, and the current and projected cash, expense and
    funding ratios of the plan. The investment policy must also
    comply with local statutory requirements as determined by each
    country. A formal asset/liability mix study of the plan is
    undertaken every 3 to 5 years or whenever there has been a
    material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or
    funding status and investment market. The Company has adopted a
    long-term investment horizon such that the risk and duration of
    investment losses are weighed against the long-term potential
    for appreciation of assets. Although there cannot be complete
    assurance that these objectives will be realized, it is believed
    that the likelihood for their realization is reasonably high,
    based upon the asset allocation chosen and the historical and
    expected performance of the asset classes utilized by the plans.
    The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified across
    asset classes, investment styles, investment managers, developed
    and emerging markets, business sectors and securities in order
    to moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments may be in
    separate accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and other
    pooled asset portfolios provided they all conform to fiduciary
    standards.

External investment managers are hired to manage the pension
    assets. An investment consultant assists with the screening
    process for each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the
    investment portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a
    composite of market indices that are weighted to match each
    plan’s target asset allocation. Long-term is considered 3
    to 5 years; however, incidences of underperformance are
    analyzed. The portfolio return should also (over the long-term)
    meet or exceed the return used for actuarial calculations in
    order to minimize future pension contributions and escalation in
    pension expense.

The expected rate of return assumptions for plan assets are
    based mainly on historical performance achieved over a long
    period of time (15 to 20 years) encompassing many business
    and economic cycles. Adjustments, upward and downward, may be
    made to those historical returns to reflect future capital
    market expectations; these expectations are typically derived
    from expert advice from the investment community and surveys of
    peer company assumptions.

In 2004, Celanese amended its long-term disability plan to align
    the benefit levels with the retiree medical plan. As a result of
    this change, the employee contribution for the long-term
    disability medical coverage increased substantially for current
    participants in the disability plan. Subsequent to the adoption
    of the change, enrollment in

the plan has been trending downward, with 20% of the
    participants declining coverage. Accordingly, the Company
    reduced the disability accrual by $9 million at
    December 31, 2005 as a result of the lower enrollment
    experience. In addition, medical claims assumptions were lowered
    to reflect actual plan experience and the percentage of
    long-term disability medical payments paid for by Medicare. This
    change lowered the long-term disability accrual by an additional
    $9 million in 2005.

Environmental

General

— The Company is subject to
    environmental laws and regulations worldwide which impose
    limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and
    water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and
    disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes
    that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable
    environmental laws and regulations. The Company is also subject
    to retained environmental obligations specified in various
    contractual agreements arising from divestiture of certain
    businesses by the Company or one of its predecessor companies.

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and for the
    nine months ended December 31, 2004, the Successor’s
    worldwide expenditures, including expenditures for legal
    compliance, internal environmental initiatives and remediation
    of active, orphan, divested and U.S. Superfund sites were
    $71 million, $84 million and $66 million,
    respectively. The Predecessor’s worldwide expenditures for
    the three months ended March 31, 2004 were
    $22 million. The Successor’s capital project related
    environmental expenditures for the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
    and the Predecessor’s for the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, included in worldwide expenditures, were
    $5 million, $8 million, $6 million and
    $2 million, respectively. Environmental reserves for
    remediation matters were $114 million and $124 million
    as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which
    represents the Company’s best estimate of its liability.

Remediation

— Due to its industrial history and
    through retained contractual and legal obligations, the Company
    has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its own sites
    as well as on divested, orphan or U.S. Superfund sites. In
    addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the
    Predecessor and Hoechst, a specified portion of the
    responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of
    Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Predecessor. The
    Company provides for such obligations when the event of loss is
    probable and reasonably estimable.

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine
    months ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, the total remediation efforts charged to
    earnings before tax were $6 million, $14 million,
    $3 million and $0 million, respectively. These charges
    were offset by reversals of previously established environmental
    reserves due to favorable trends in estimates at unrelated sites
    of $0 million, $10 million, $2 million and
    $2 million during the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005, the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the
    three months ended March 31, 2004, respectively. In 2005,
    the Company also recorded a $7 million reduction to
    previously established environmental reserves due to the sale of
    the Rock Hill plant (See Note 6). The Company believes that
    environmental remediation costs will not have a material adverse
    effect on the financial position of the Company, but may have a
    material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash
    flows in any given accounting period.

The Company did not record any insurance recoveries related to
    these matters for the reported periods. There are no receivables
    for recoveries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

German InfraServs

— On January 1, 1997,
    coinciding with a reorganization of the Hoechst businesses in
    Germany, real estate service companies (“InfraServs”)
    were created to own directly the land and property and to
    provide various technical and administrative services at each of
    the manufacturing locations. The Company has manufacturing
    operations at three InfraServ locations in Germany: Oberhausen,
    Frankfurt am Main-Hoechst and Kelsterbach, and holds interests
    in the companies which own and operate the former Hoechst sites
    in Gendorf, Knapsack and Wiesbaden.

F-45


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

InfraServs are liable for any residual contamination and other
    pollution because they own the real estate on which the
    individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, as the
    responsible party under German public law, is liable to third
    parties for all environmental damage that occurred while it was
    still the owner of the plants and real estate. The contribution
    agreements entered into in 1997 between Hoechst and the
    respective operating companies, as part of the divestiture of
    these companies, provide that the operating companies will
    indemnify Hoechst against environmental liabilities resulting
    from the transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServs
    have agreed to indemnify Hoechst against any environmental
    liability arising out of or in connection with environmental
    pollution of any site. Likewise, in certain circumstances the
    Company could be responsible for the elimination of residual
    contamination on a few sites that were not transferred to
    InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst must reimburse the
    Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between
    the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination
    caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which
    cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no
    third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the
    InfraServ Partnership. In view of this potential obligation to
    eliminate residual contamination, the InfraServs, primarily
    relating to equity and cost affiliates which are not
    consolidated by the Company, have reserves of $78 million
    and $69 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective
    indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination,
    the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ
    companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a
    number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are
    not satisfied by either the InfraServs or their owners, these
    liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with
    the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst will reimburse the
    Company for two-thirds of any such costs. Likewise, in certain
    circumstances the Company could be responsible for the
    elimination of residual contamination on several sites that were
    not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst
    must also reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so
    incurred. The German InfraServs are owned partially by the
    Company, as noted below, and the remaining ownership is held by
    various other companies. The Company’s ownership interest
    and environmental liability participation percentages for such
    liabilities which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner
    were as follows as of December 31, 2006:

U.S. Superfund Sites

— In the U.S., the
    Company may be subject to substantial claims brought by
    U.S. federal or state regulatory agencies or private
    individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In
    particular, the Company has a potential liability under the
    U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related
    state laws (collectively referred to as “Superfund”)
    for investigation and cleanup costs at approximately 50 sites.
    At most of these sites, numerous companies, including certain
    companies comprising the Company, or one of its predecessor
    companies, have been notified that the Environmental Protection
    Agency, state governing bodies or private individuals consider
    such companies to be potentially responsible parties
    (“PRP”) under Superfund or related laws. The
    proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The
    cleanup process has not been completed at most sites and the
    status of the insurance coverage for most of these proceedings
    is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot determine
    accurately its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup
    costs at these sites. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company had

F-46


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provisions totaling $15 million and $15 million,
    respectively, for U.S. Superfund sites and utilized
    $1 million, $2 million, $2 million and less than
    $1 million of these reserves during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31,
    2004, respectively. Additional provisions and adjustments
    recorded during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the three
    months ended March 31, 2004 approximately offset these
    expenditures.

As events progress at each site for which it has been named a
    PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site
    cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these
    liabilities, the Company considers its shipment of waste to a
    site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the
    types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the
    magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the
    number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company will join
    with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that will
    settle, among PRPs, each party’s percentage allocation of
    costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ
    from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities
    and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most
    current information available.

Hoechst Liabilities

— In connection with the
    Hoechst demerger, Celanese agreed to indemnify Hoechst for the
    first €250 million (approximately $330 million)
    of future remediation liabilities for environmental damages
    arising from 19 specified divested Hoechst entities. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, reserves of $33 million
    and $33 million, respectively, for these matters are
    included as a component of the total environmental reserves. As
    of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company, has made total
    cumulative payments of $44 million and $41 million,
    respectively. If such future liabilities exceed
    €250 million (approximately $330 million),
    Hoechst will bear such excess up to an additional
    €500 million (approximately $660 million).
    Thereafter, the Company will bear one-third and Hoechst will
    bear two-thirds of any further environmental remediation
    liabilities. Where the Company is unable to reasonably determine
    the probability of loss or estimate such loss under this
    indemnification, the Company has not recognized any liabilities
    relative to this indemnification.

Preferred
    Stock

As a result of the initial public offering in January 2005 (See
    Note 3), the Company now has $240 million aggregate
    liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock. Holders
    of the preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if,
    declared by the Company’s board of directors, out of funds
    legally available therefore, cash dividends at the rate of
    4.25% per annum of liquidation preference, payable
    quarterly in arrears, commencing on May 1, 2005. Dividends
    on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of initial
    issuance. Accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at an
    annual rate of 4.25%. The preferred stock is convertible, at the
    option of the holder, at any time into approximately
    1.25 shares of Series A common stock, subject to
    adjustments, per $25.00 liquidation preference of preferred
    stock and upon conversion will be recorded in Shareholders’
    equity. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
    $2 million of accumulated but undeclared and unpaid
    dividends, which were declared on January 5, 2007 and paid
    on February 1, 2007.

Additional
    Paid-in Capital

In connection with the demerger and pursuant to the Demerger
    Agreement executed and delivered by the Predecessor and Hoechst,
    the Predecessor assumed certain Hoechst’s businesses as
    well as certain contractual rights, including indemnifications.
    For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine
    months ended December 31, 2004, the Successor recorded
    $3 million, $5 million and $3 million,
    respectively, increases in Additional paid-in capital related to
    recoveries due from Hoechst for the antitrust matters in the
    sorbates industry. During the three months ended March 31,
    2004, the Predecessor received no recoveries from Hoechst for
    the antitrust matters in the sorbates industry (See
    Note 25).

During the year ended December 31, 2005, Additional paid-in
    capital was increased by $1 million related to stock
    options that were subject to variable plan accounting. Also,
    Additional paid-in capital was increased by $1 million and
    $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and
    the nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively,
    related to the Company’s discounted share program (See
    Note 22). As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R)
    in 2006, there was no impact to Additional paid-in capital
    related to stock options that were subject to variable plan
    accounting.

Funding for the Acquisition included an initial equity
    investment of $641 million from Blackstone Capital Partners
    (Cayman) Ltd. 1, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd.
    2 and Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 3 (collectively,
    ”Blackstone”) and BA Capital Investors Sidecar Fund,
    L.P. (and together with Blackstone, the ”Original

Original
    Shareholders Sale of Series A Common Stock

On May 9, 2006, the Company filed with the SEC a universal
    shelf registration statement on

Form S-3,

thus registering shares of its Series A common stock,
    shares of its preferred stock and depository shares. On
    May 10, 2006, the Original Shareholders agreed to sell
    35,000,000 shares of Series A common stock through a
    registered public secondary offering and granted to the
    underwriter an over-allotment option to purchase up to an
    additional 5,250,000 shares of the Company’s
    Series A common stock. The underwriter did not exercise the
    over-allotment option. The Company did not receive any of the
    proceeds from the offering. The transaction closed on
    May 15, 2006. The Company incurred and expensed
    approximately $2 million of fees related to this
    transaction.

On November 7, 2006, the Original Shareholders sold an
    additional 30,000,000 shares of Series A common stock
    in a registered public secondary offering pursuant to the
    universal shelf registration statement on

Dividends

During 2005, the Company’s board of directors adopted a
    policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a
    quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company’s
    Series A common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per share
    unless the Company’s board of directors, in its sole
    discretion, determines otherwise. Further, such dividends
    payable to holders of the Company’s Series A common
    stock cannot be declared or paid nor can any funds be set aside
    for the payment thereof, unless the Company has paid or set
    aside funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid
    dividends with respect to the shares of the Company’s
    preferred stock, as described above.

In September 2004, the Company issued senior discount notes for
    gross proceeds of $513 million and distributed
    $500 million of the proceeds to the Original Shareholders
    in the form of a dividend.

On March 8, 2005, the Company declared a special cash
    dividend to holders of the Company’s Series B common
    stock of $804 million, which was paid on April 7,
    2005. Upon payment of the $804 million dividend, all of the
    outstanding shares of Series B common stock converted
    automatically to shares of Series A common stock.

On March 9, 2005, the Company issued 7,500,000 shares
    of Series A common stock in the form of a stock dividend to
    the Original Shareholders of its Series B common stock.

During 2006 and 2005, the Company declared and paid dividends to
    holders of its Series A common shares of $26 million
    and $13 million, respectively. The 2005 dividends were
    recorded to Additional paid-in capital as the Company had an
    accumulated deficit until the fourth quarter of 2005.

Other
    (Charges) Gains, Net

Other (charges) gains, net includes provisions for restructuring
    and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal course
    of operations. Restructuring provisions represent costs related
    to severance and other benefit programs related to major
    activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign the business
    operations, as well as costs incurred in connection with
    decisions to exit non-strategic businesses. These measures are
    based on formal management decisions, establishment of
    agreements with employees’ representatives or individual
    agreements with affected employees, as well as the public
    announcement of the restructuring plan. The related reserves
    reflect certain estimates, including those pertaining to
    separation costs, settlements of contractual obligations and
    other closure costs. The Company reassesses the reserve
    requirements to complete each individual plan under existing
    restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period.
    Actual experience may be different from these estimates.

In connection with the completion of the initial public offering
    in January 2005, the parties amended and restated the
    transaction and monitoring fee agreement to terminate the
    monitoring services and all obligations to pay future monitoring
    fees and paid Blackstone Management Partners (the
    ”Advisor”) $35 million, which is included in

Advisor for the 2005 monitoring fee, which is included in
    Selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated
    statement of operations (See Note 28).

Asset impairments in 2005 and 2004 primarily relate to the
    Company’s decision to divest its COC business (See
    Note 6).

Other (charges) gains, net also includes charges related to a
    change in environmental remediation strategy related to the
    closure of the Edmonton methanol plant, as well as severance
    primarily associated with the same closure of $8 million
    and severance related to the relocation of corporate offices of
    $10 million.

These charges were offset by $34 million of income related
    to insurance recoveries associated with plumbing actions.


In October 2004, the Company announced plans to consolidate its
    tow production to fewer sites by 2007. In the third quarter of
    2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges of
    $43 million related to asset impairment of the
    Company’s acetate business. The restructuring was
    implemented to increase efficiency, reduce overcapacity and to
    focus on products and markets that provide long-term value.

During the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the Company
    continued with its redesign initiatives. The Chemical Products
    segment recorded $4 million of severance and organizational
    redesign costs, which included $2 million related to the
    shutdown of an obsolete synthesis gas unit in Germany. Ticona
    recorded $6 million similarly for severance, relocation and
    employee related expenses, primarily associated with
    management’s initiative to relocate the segment’s
    administrative and research and development functions from
    Summit, New Jersey to Florence, Kentucky.

For the three months ended March 31, 2004, the Predecessor
    recorded other (charges) gains, net of $26 million for
    advisory services related to the Acquisition.

    was headquartered in Germany. Under German tax law, German
    corporations are subject to both a corporate income tax and a
    trade income tax, the latter of which varies based upon
    location. The German corporate income tax rate for the three
    months ended March 31, 2004 was 25%. Combined with a
    solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the corporate tax, and the
    blended trade income tax rate after corporate tax benefit, the
    statutory tax rate in Germany was 40%.

Deferred taxes are being provided at a 37% rate for the
    U.S. companies as of December 31, 2006. Deferred taxes
    for non-U.S. companies are being provided at the tax rate that
    will be in effect in the local tax jurisdictions at the time the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse, with applicable
    rates ranging from 0% to 42%.

Includes impact of earnings from Singapore subject to tax
    holidays, which expire between 2007 and 2013.

The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004
    was 38%, 16% and negative 39%, respectively. The effective tax
    rate for the three months ended March 31, 2004 was 23%.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, and as compared to
    the statutory rate, the effective tax rate was favorably
    impacted by unrepatriated low taxed earnings, primarily in
    Singapore and Bermuda. The effective tax rate was unfavorably
    affected by (1) passive income inclusions from foreign
    subsidiaries, (2) dividends in excess of equity earnings from
    equity investments, (3) net increases in reserves for tax
    contingencies, and (4) higher tax rates in certain foreign
    jurisdictions, primarily Germany. The effective rate also
    reflects a partial benefit for the reversal of valuation
    allowance on earnings in the U.S. Reversals of the valuation
    allowance established at the Acquisition resulting from positive
    earnings or a change in judgment regarding the realizability of
    the net deferred tax asset are primarily reflected as a
    reduction of goodwill. Therefore the effective tax rate reflects
    only a partial benefit for reversal of valuation allowance of
    approximately $5 million offset by increases in valuation
    allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions. A valuation
    allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a
    deferred tax asset, all or in part, will not be realized.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, and as compared to
    the statutory rate, the effective tax rate was favorably
    affected by unrepatriated low-taxed earnings, primarily in
    Singapore and Bermuda. The effective tax rate was also favorably
    affected by the reversal of valuation allowance on certain
    German deferred tax assets of $31 million, primarily net
    operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by increasing
    valuation allowances on losses in other countries.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, and as
    compared to the statutory rate, the effective tax rate was
    unfavorably affected primarily by the application of full
    valuation allowances against post-acquisition net
    U.S. deferred tax assets, Canadian deferred tax assets due
    to post-acquisition restructuring and certain German deferred
    tax assets. The effective rate was also unfavorably affected by
    the non-recognition of tax benefits

F-53


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

associated with acquisition related expenses. The unfavorable
    effects were partially offset by unrepatriated low taxed
    earnings, primarily in Singapore. In the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004, the Company finalized certain tax audits
    related to the pre-acquisition period which resulted in a
    reduction to Income taxes payable of approximately
    $113 million with a corresponding reduction to Goodwill.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31,
    2004 was based on a 24% annualized effective rate which was
    primarily attributable to projected unrepatriated low taxed
    earnings in Singapore.

The tax effects of the temporary differences which give rise to
    a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    as follows:

Includes deferred tax asset valuation allowances primarily for
    the Company’s deferred tax assets in the U.S., Mexico,
    France and certain Canadian entities, as well as other foreign
    jurisdictions. These valuation allowances relate to net
    operating loss carryforward benefits and other net deferred tax
    assets, all of which may not be realizable.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, valuation allowance
    had a net decrease of $250 million. Of this amount, a
    decrease of approximately $54 million was allocated to
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net for pension
    and other post retirement benefits associated with the adoption
    of SFAS 158. Valuation allowance on state deferred tax
    assets related to net operating losses decreased approximately
    $27 million due to changes in apportionment and
    pre-acquisition losses that expired unused. Valuation allowance
    decreased approximately $74 million related to resolution
    of uncertainties in net tax basis associated with the
    pre-acquisition period accounted for pursuant to

EITF 93-7,

Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a Purchase Business
    Combination

. Finally, valuation allowance decreased related
    to realization of pre-acquisition deferred tax assets as
    discussed below.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had U.S. federal net
    operating loss carryforwards of approximately $225 million,
    which will begin to expire in 2023. Of this amount,
    approximately $46 million relates to the pre-Acquisition
    period and is subject to significant limitation. The remaining
    amount of $179 million is subject to limitation as a result
    of the change in stock ownership in May 2006. However, this
    limitation is not expected to have a material impact on
    utilization of the net operating loss. The acquisition and
    corresponding tax law governing the utilization of acquired net
    operating losses triggered these limitations.

The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
    approximately $432 million for Germany, Mexico, France and
    other foreign jurisdictions with various expiration dates. Net
    operating losses in Germany and France

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

have no expiration date. Net operating losses in Mexico have a
    ten year carryforward and begin to expire in 2009. Net operating
    losses in Canada have various carryforward periods and begin to
    expire in 2007.

The U.S. net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2004
    were $439 million. As a result of the Acquisition, a full
    valuation allowance was applied against these net assets with a
    corresponding increase in Goodwill. In addition, there was
    approximately $63 million of valuation allowance associated
    with pre-acquisition net deferred tax assets in Mexico, Canada
    and France. Subsequent recognition of any tax benefit related to
    these temporary differences

and/or

certain pre-acquisition net operating losses will be a decrease
    to Goodwill. In 2006, the valuation allowance decreased
    approximately $84 million due to realization of
    pre-acquisition net deferred tax assets and net operating losses
    in the U.S. and Spain.

The Company had U.S. capital loss carryforwards of
    $104 million, which expired in October 2004 and accordingly
    are not reflected in the 2004 deferred tax assets and valuation
    allowance amounts above.

Provisions have not been made for income taxes or foreign
    withholding taxes on cumulative earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    of approximately $847 million because such earnings will
    either not be subject to any such taxes or are intended to be
    indefinitely reinvested in those operations. In addition, the
    Company has not provided taxes on approximately
    $413 million of temporary differences attributable to
    investments in foreign subsidiaries and corporate ventures
    because such differences are essentially permanent in duration.
    It is not practical to determine the tax liability, if any, that
    would be payable if such amounts were not reinvested
    indefinitely or were not permanent in duration.

The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005
    (“TIPRA”), which was signed in to law in May 2006,
    provides for a new temporary exception to certain U.S. tax
    foreign passive income inclusion rules for 2006 to 2008. This
    change significantly reduced the expected amount of foreign
    income taxed currently in the U.S.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”),
    which was signed into law in October 2004, introduced a special
    one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of
    certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided
    certain criteria are met. This provision was applicable to the
    last tax year that began before the enactment date, or that
    begins in the one-year period beginning on the enactment date.
    The Company did not utilize this provision.

The income tax (benefit) expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31,
    2004 was allocated to continuing operations and Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), net. The aggregate tax
    expense (benefit) amounts allocated to Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net, for unrealized gains (losses)
    on securities, pension and postretirement benefits associated
    with the adoption of SFAS No. 158 and unrealized gains
    (losses) on derivative contracts was $3 million,
    $(21) million, $(2) million and $2 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months
    ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, respectively. The income tax (benefit)
    expense associated with Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net is dependent upon the tax jurisdiction in which the
    items arise and accordingly could result in an effective tax
    rate that is different from the overall consolidated effective
    income tax rate on the statement of operations.

Stock-Based
    and Other Management Compensation Plans

In December 2004, the Company approved a stock incentive plan
    for executive officers, key employees and directors, a deferred
    compensation plan for executive officers and key employees as
    well as other management incentive programs.

These plans allow for the issuance or delivery of up to
    16,250,000 shares of the Company’s Series A
    common stock through a discounted share program and stock
    options.

Deferred
    compensation

The deferred compensation plan has an aggregate maximum amount
    payable of $196 million. The initial component of the
    deferred compensation plan vested in 2004 and was paid in the
    first quarter of 2005. The remaining aggregate maximum amount
    payable of $142 million is subject to downward adjustment
    if the price of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company’s Series A common stock falls below the
    initial public offering price of $16 per share and vests
    subject to both (1) continued employment or the achievement
    of certain performance criteria and (2) the disposition by
    three of the four Original Shareholders of at least 90% of their
    equity interest in the Company with at least a 25% cash internal
    rate of return on their equity interest. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004, the Company recorded compensation
    expense of $19 million, $1 million and
    $27 million, respectively, associated with this plan.
    During the three months ended March 31, 2004, the Company
    did not record any compensation expense associated with this
    plan. Upon the occurrence of a qualifying sale, as defined, the
    amount vested and payable under the plan as of December 31,
    2006 would be approximately $75 million, exclusive of the
    $19 million accrued in 2006 and payable in 2007 due to the
    accelerated vesting of certain plan participants.

Long-term
    incentive plan

Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted a long-term
    incentive plan (the “LTIP Plan”) which covers certain
    members of management and other key employees of the Company.
    The LTIP Plan is a three-year cash based plan in which awards
    will be based on annual and three-year cumulative targets (as
    defined in the LTIP Plan). Payouts to employees could be
    considerably increased if the annual and three-year cumulative
    targets are significantly exceeded. The Company has determined
    that these targets will be significantly exceeded. Payout under
    the LTIP Plan will occur following the end of year three of the
    LTIP Plan. On February 16, 2007, approximately $26 million was
    paid to the LTIP plan participants. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31,
    2004, the Company recorded expense of $19 million,
    $5 million, $1 million and less than $1 million,
    respectively, related to the LTIP Plan.

Discounted
    Shares

In December 2004, the Company granted rights to executive
    officers and key employees to purchase up to
    1,797,386 shares of Series A common stock at a
    discount of $8.80 per share. As of December 31, 2006,
    1,684,277 shares have been purchased. As a result of this
    discounted share offering, the Company recorded a pre-tax
    non-cash charge of $14 million, with a corresponding
    adjustment to Additional paid-in capital within
    Shareholders’ equity in the fourth quarter 2004.
    Compensation expense associated with the discounted shares was
    approximately $0 million and $1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Stock-based
    compensation

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan that makes
    awards of stock options to certain employees. Prior to
    January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for awards granted
    under this plan using the intrinsic value method of expense
    recognition, which follows the recognition and measurement
    principles of APB No. 25 and related interpretations.
    Compensation cost, if any, was recorded based on the excess of
    the quoted market price at grant date over the amount an
    employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under the provisions of
    APB No. 25, there was no compensation expense resulting
    from the issuance of the stock options as the exercise price was
    equivalent to the fair market value at the date of grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The
    Company has elected the modified prospective transition method
    as permitted by SFAS No. 123(R) and, accordingly,
    prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Under this transition method,
    compensation cost recognized for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 includes: (i) compensation cost for
    all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as
    of, January 1, 2006 (based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 and previously presented in the pro forma
    footnote disclosures), and (ii) compensation cost for all
    stock-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006
    (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the new provisions of SFAS No. 123(R)).

F-56


CELANESE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

It is the Company’s policy to grant options with an
    exercise price equal to the price of the Company’s
    Series A common stock on the grant date. The options issued
    have a ten-year term with vesting terms pursuant to a schedule,
    with all vesting to occur no later than the eighth anniversary
    of the date of the grant. Accelerated vesting depends on meeting
    specified performance targets. The estimated value of the
    Company’s stock-based awards less expected forfeitures is
    amortized over the awards’ respective vesting period on the
    applicable graded or straight-line basis, subject to
    acceleration as discussed above. As a result of adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R), the Company’s net earnings for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, was $13 million (net
    of tax of $7 million) lower than it would have been if the
    Company had continued to account for share-based compensation
    under APB No. 25. These amounts are included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses.

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date
    of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The
    weighted average assumptions used in the model are outlined in
    the following table:

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on
    historical volatilities and volatilities of peer companies. When
    establishing the expected life assumptions, the Company reviews
    annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants
    with similar vesting periods and the expected life assumptions
    of peer companies. The Company utilized the review of peer
    companies based on its own lack of extensive history.

Financial
    Instruments

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    interest rate swap agreements, designated as cash flow hedges,
    with a notional value of $300 million in place.

Differences between amounts paid or received on interest rate
    swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest
    expense over the life of each interest rate swap, thereby
    adjusting the effective interest rate on the hedged obligation.
    The Successor recognized interest expense (income) from hedging
    activities relating to interest rate swaps of $(1) million,
    $3 million and $1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004, respectively. The Predecessor recognized
    interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest
    rate swaps of $2 million for the three months ended
    March 31, 2004.

Gains and losses on instruments not meeting the criteria for
    cash flow hedge accounting treatment, or that cease to meet
    hedge accounting criteria, are included as Other income
    (expense), net. The Successor recorded a net loss of less than
    $1 million in Other income (expense), net for the
    ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps for each of the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine months
    ended December 31, 2004. The Predecessor recorded a net
    loss of less than $1 million in Other income (expense), net
    for the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps, during
    the three months ended March 31, 2004. During the nine
    months ended December 31, 2004, the Successor recorded a
    loss of less than $1 million in Other income (expense),
    net, associated with the early termination of its
    $200 million interest rate swap.

If an interest rate swap is terminated prior to its maturity,
    the gain or loss is recorded in Other income (expense), net and
    recognized over the remaining original life of the swap if the
    item hedged remains outstanding, or immediately, if the item
    hedged does not remain outstanding. If the interest rate swap is
    not terminated prior to maturity, but the underlying hedged item
    is no longer outstanding, the interest rate swap is marked to
    market and any unrealized gain or loss is recognized immediately.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

Certain entities have receivables and payables denominated in
    currencies other than their respective functional currencies,
    which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company may enter into
    foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize its exposure to
    foreign currency fluctuations. The foreign currency contracts
    are mainly for booked exposure and, in some cases, cash flow
    hedges for anticipated exposure associated with sales from the
    Performance Products segment.

The Company has foreign currency contracts with notional amounts
    totaling approximately $713 million and $564 million
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, that are
    predominantly in U.S. dollars, British pound sterling,
    Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Most of the Company’s
    foreign currency forward contracts do not meet the criteria of
    SFAS No. 133 to qualify for hedge accounting. The
    Company recognizes net foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses on the underlying transactions, which are offset by
    losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts.
    At December 31, 2006 and 2005, these contracts, in addition
    to natural hedges, hedged approximately 90% and 100%,
    respectively, of the Company’s net receivables held in
    currencies other than the entities’ functional currency.
    Related to the unhedged portion, a net gain (loss) of
    approximately $1 million, $20 million,
    ($2) million and $4 million from foreign exchange
    gains or losses was recorded to Other income (expense), net for
    the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months
    ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended
    March 31, 2004, respectively.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In June 2004, to protect the foreign currency exposure of a net
    investment in a foreign operation, the Company entered into
    cross currency swaps with certain financial institutions. Under
    the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, the Company
    will pay approximately €13 million in interest and
    receive approximately $16 million in interest on each June
    15 and December 15. Upon maturity of the cross currency
    swap agreements in June 2008, the Company will pay approximately
    €276 million and receive approximately
    $333 million. The Company designated the cross currency
    swaps, part of its senior euro term loan and the euro senior
    subordinated note as a net investment hedge (for accounting
    purposes) in the fourth quarter of 2004. The effective portion
    of the gain (loss) on the derivative (cross currency swaps) and
    the foreign currency gain (loss) on the non-derivative financial
    instruments is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net. For the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004, the
    amount charged to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
    net was $(23) million, $30 million and
    $(22) million, respectively. The gain (loss) related to the
    ineffectiveness of the cross currency swap is recorded in Other
    income (expense), net. For the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
    the amount charged to Other income (expense), net was
    $5 million, $3 million and $(21) million,
    respectively.

Commodity
    Risk Management

The Company’s policy for the majority of its commodity raw
    materials requirements allows the Company to enter into supply
    agreements and forward purchase swap contracts. The Company
    regularly assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its
    commodity requirements forward and the utilization of a variety
    of other raw material hedging instruments, in addition to
    forward purchase contracts, in accordance with changes in market
    conditions. The commodity raw material forward purchase and swap
    contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of the
    physical commodity. Although these forward purchase and swap
    contracts were structured to limit exposure to increases in
    commodity prices, they may also limit the potential benefit the
    Company might have otherwise received from decreases in
    commodity prices. The Company has elected to apply the normal
    purchases provision to the forward purchase and swap contracts
    that qualify as derivative instruments as it was probable at the
    inception and throughout the term of the contract that they
    would not settle net and would result in physical delivery. As
    such, realized gains and losses on these contracts are included
    in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

Occasionally the Company will enter into cash settled financial
    derivatives to hedge a component of a commodity raw material or
    energy source. Typically these types of transactions do not
    qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are marked to
    market at each reporting period and gains (losses) are included
    in Cost of sales. The Successor recognized losses of less than
    $1 million from these types of contracts during each of the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the nine months
    ended December 31, 2004, respectively. The Predecessor
    recognized a loss of $1 million from these types of
    contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2004. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have any
    open commodity financial derivative contracts.

    short-term debt and the current installments of long-term debt
    approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of
    these instruments. These items have been excluded from the
    table. Additionally, certain long-term receivables, principally
    insurance recoverables, are carried at net realizable value (See
    Note 25).

Included in other assets are long-term marketable securities
    classified as

In general, the cost investments included in the table above are
    not publicly traded and their fair values are not readily
    determinable; however, the Company believes that the carrying
    value approximates or is less than the fair value.

The fair value of long-term debt and debt-related financial
    instruments is estimated based upon the respective implied
    forward rates as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, as well as
    quotations from investment bankers and on current rates of debt
    for similar type instruments.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of
    business, relating to such matters as product liability,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices and release of
    chemicals into the environment. While it is impossible at this
    time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these
    proceedings, lawsuits and claims, the Company believes, based on
    the advice of legal counsel, that adequate provisions have been
    made and that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material
    adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but may
    have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or
    cash flows in any given accounting period.

Plumbing
    Actions

CNA Holdings, Inc. (“CNA Holdings”), a
    U.S. subsidiary of the Company, which included the
    U.S. business now conducted by the Ticona segment, along
    with Shell Oil Company (“Shell”), E.I. DuPont de
    Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) and others, has been a
    defendant in a series of lawsuits, including a number of class
    actions, alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies
    that were utilized in the production of plumbing systems for
    residential property were defective or caused such plumbing
    systems to fail. Based on, among other things, the findings of
    outside experts and the successful use of Ticona’s acetal
    copolymer in similar applications, CNA Holdings does not
    believe Ticona’s acetal copolymer was defective or caused
    the plumbing systems to fail. In many cases

F-61


CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

CNA Holdings’ exposure may be limited by invocation of the
    statute of limitations since CNA Holdings ceased selling the
    resin for use in the plumbing systems in site-built homes during
    1986 and in manufactured homes during 1990.

CNA Holdings has been named a defendant in ten putative class
    actions, as well as a defendant in other

non-class

actions filed in ten states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and
    Canada. In these actions, the plaintiffs typically have sought
    recovery for alleged property damages and, in some cases,
    additional damages under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act
    or similar type statutes. Damage amounts have not been specified.

In November 1995, CNA Holdings, DuPont and Shell entered into
    national class action settlements, which have been approved by
    the courts. The settlements call for the replacement of plumbing
    systems of claimants who have had qualifying leaks, as well as
    reimbursements for certain leak damage. Furthermore, the three
    companies had agreed to fund these replacements and
    reimbursements up to $950 million. As of December 31,
    2006, the aggregate funding is $1,093 million due to
    additional contributions and funding commitments made primarily
    by other parties. There are additional pending lawsuits in
    approximately ten jurisdictions, not covered by this settlement;
    however, these cases do not involve (either individually or in
    the aggregate) a large number of homes, and the Company does not
    expect the obligations arising from these lawsuits to have a
    material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In addition, a lawsuit filed in November 1989 in Delaware
    Chancery Court, between CNA Holdings and various of its
    insurance companies relating to all claims incurred and to be
    incurred for the product liability exposure led to a partial
    declaratory judgment in CNA Holdings’ favor.

CNA Holdings has accrued its best estimate of its share of the
    plumbing actions. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company had remaining accruals of $66 million and
    $68 million, respectively, for this matter, of which
    $4 million and $6 million, respectively, is included
    in current liabilities. The Company believes that the plumbing
    actions are adequately provided for in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and that they will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position. However, if
    the Company were to incur an additional charge for this matter,
    such a charge would not be expected to have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position, but may have a material
    adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any
    given accounting period.

The Company has reached settlements with CNA Holdings’
    insurers specifying their responsibility for these claims; as a
    result, the Company has recorded receivables relating to the
    anticipated recoveries from certain third party insurance
    carriers. These receivables are based on the probability of
    collection, an opinion of external counsel, the settlement
    agreements with the Company’s insurance carriers whose
    coverage level exceeds the receivables and the status of current
    discussions with other insurance carriers. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company has
    $23 million and $37 million, respectively, of
    receivables related to a settlement with an insurance carrier.
    This receivable is recorded within other assets.

Sorbates
    Antitrust Actions

In May 2002, the European Commission informed Hoechst of its
    intent to investigate officially the sorbates industry. In early
    January 2003, the European Commission served Hoechst, Nutrinova,
    Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Nutrinova Nutrition
    Specialties & Food Ingredients GmbH, previously a
    wholly owned subsidiary of Hoechst, and a number of competitors
    with a statement of objections alleging unlawful,
    anticompetitive behavior affecting the European sorbates market.
    In October 2003, the European Commission ruled that Hoechst,
    Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd., The Nippon
    Synthetic Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. and Ueno Fine Chemicals
    Industry Ltd. operated a cartel in the European sorbates market
    between 1979 and 1996. The European Commission imposed a total
    fine of €138 million, of which €99 million
    was assessed against Hoechst. The case against Nutrinova was
    closed. The fine against Hoechst is based on the European
    Commission’s finding that Hoechst does not qualify under
    the leniency policy, is a repeat violator and, together with
    Daicel, was a co-conspirator. In Hoechst’s favor, the

    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

European Commission gave a discount for cooperating in the
    investigation. Hoechst appealed the European Commission’s
    decision in December 2003, and that appeal is still pending.

In addition, several civil antitrust actions by sorbates
    customers, seeking monetary damages and other relief for alleged
    conduct involving the sorbates industry, have been filed in
    U.S. state and federal courts naming Hoechst, Nutrinova,
    and our other subsidiaries, as well as other sorbates
    manufacturers, as defendants. These actions have all been either
    settled or dismissed. The only other private action previously
    pending,

Freeman v. Daicel et al.

, had
    been dismissed. The plaintiffs lost their appeal to the Supreme
    Court of Tennessee in August 2005 and have since filed a motion
    for leave.

In July 2001, Hoechst and Nutrinova entered into an agreement
    with the Attorneys General of 33 states, pursuant to which
    the statutes of limitations were tolled pending the states’
    investigations. This agreement expired in July 2003. Since
    October 2002, the Attorneys General for New York, Illinois,
    Ohio, Nevada, Utah and Idaho filed suit on behalf of indirect
    purchasers in their respective states. The Utah, Nevada and
    Idaho actions have been dismissed as to Hoechst, Nutrinova and
    the Company. A motion for reconsideration is pending in Nevada.
    The Ohio and Illinois actions have been settled and the Idaho
    action was dismissed in February 2005. The New York action,

New York v. Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd.,
    et al.

which was pending in the New York State Supreme
    Court, New York County was dismissed in August 2005. The
    New York Attorney General appealed the decision to dismiss the
    case, which is currently pending.

Based on the advice of external counsel and a review of the
    existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates
    antitrust matters, including the status of government
    investigations, as well as civil claims filed and settled, the
    Company has remaining accruals at December 31, 2006 of
    $148 million. This amount is included in current
    liabilities for the estimated loss relative to this matter. At
    December 31, 2005, the accrual was $129 million. The
    change in the accrual amounts is primarily due to fluctuations
    in the currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
    the euro. Although the outcome of this matter cannot be
    predicted with certainty, the Company’s best estimate of
    the range of possible additional future losses and fines (in
    excess of amounts already accrued), including any that may
    result from the above noted governmental proceedings, as of
    December 31, 2006 is between $0 million and
    $9 million. The estimated range of such possible future
    losses is the Company’s best estimate based on the advice
    of external counsel taking into consideration potential fines
    and claims, both civil and criminal that may be imposed or made
    in other jurisdictions.

Pursuant to the Demerger Agreement with Hoechst, Celanese AG was
    assigned the obligation related to the sorbates antitrust
    matter. However, Hoechst agreed to indemnify Celanese AG for 80%
    of any costs Celanese may incur relative to this matter.
    Accordingly, Celanese AG has recognized a receivable from
    Hoechst and a corresponding contribution of capital, net of tax,
    from this indemnification. As of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company has receivables, recorded within current
    assets, relating to the sorbates indemnification from Hoechst
    totaling $118 million and $103 million, respectively.
    The Company believes that any resulting liabilities, net of
    amounts recoverable from Hoechst, will not, in the aggregate,
    have a material adverse effect on its financial position, but
    may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations
    or cash flows in any given period.

Acetic
    Acid Patent Infringement Matters

Celanese International Corporation v. China
    Petrochemical Development Corporation — Taiwan
    Kaohsiung District Court.

On May 9, 1999,
    Celanese International Corporation filed a private criminal
    action for patent infringement against China Petrochemical
    Development Corporation, or CPDC, alleging that CPDC infringed
    Celanese International Corporation’s patent covering the
    manufacture of acetic acid. Celanese International Corporation
    also filed a supplementary civil brief which, in view of changes
    in Taiwanese patent laws, was subsequently converted to a civil
    action alleging damages against CPDC based on a period of
    infringement of ten years,

1991-2000,

and based on CPDC’s own data and as reported to the
    Taiwanese securities and exchange commission. Celanese
    International Corporation’s patent was held valid by the
    Taiwanese patent office. On August 31, 2005 a Taiwanese
    court held that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s acetic acid

patent and awarded Celanese International Corporation
    approximately $28 million (plus interest of
    $10 million) for the period of 1995 through 1999. The
    judgment has been appealed. The Company will not record income
    associated with this favorable judgment until cash is received.
    CPDC has recently filed three patent cancellation actions
    seeking decisions to revoke the patents that are at issue in the
    litigation. The Company believes that these actions are without
    merit and intends to vigorously oppose such actions.

Shareholder
    Litigation

A number of minority shareholders of CAG have filed lawsuits in
    the Frankfurt District Court that, among other things, request
    the court to set aside shareholder resolutions passed at the
    extraordinary general meeting held on July 30 and 31,
    2004, as well as the confirmatory resolutions passed at the
    annual general meeting held on May 19 and 20, 2005. On
    March 6, 2006, the Purchaser and CAG signed a settlement
    agreement with eleven minority shareholders who had filed such
    lawsuits (the “Settlement Agreement I”). Pursuant to
    the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw the
    actions to which they were a party and to recognize the validity
    of the Domination Agreement in exchange for the Purchaser to
    offer least €51.00 per share as cash consideration to
    each shareholder who would cease to be a shareholder in the
    context of the Squeeze-Out. The Purchaser further agreed to make
    early payment of the guaranteed annual payment pursuant to the
    Domination Agreement for the financial year 2005/2006, ending on
    September 30, 2006. Such guaranteed annual payment normally
    would have come due following the annual general meeting in
    2007; however, pursuant to Settlement Agreement I, it was
    made on the first banking day following CAG’s annual
    general meeting that commenced on May 30, 2006 (See
    Note 2). In exchange for the early compensation payment,
    the respective minority shareholder had to declare that
    (i) their claim for payment of compensation for the
    financial year 2005/2006 pursuant to the Domination Agreement is
    settled by such early payment and that (ii) in this
    respect, they indemnify the Purchaser against compensation
    claims by any legal successors to their shares.

Of the twenty-seven lawsuits contesting the shareholder
    resolutions passed at the annual general meeting held May

19-20,

2005,
    two were withdrawn in conjunction with the Purchaser’s
    acquisition of 5.9 million CAG shares from two shareholders
    in August 2005 and another ten have been withdrawn pursuant to
    Settlement Agreement I (See Note 2). In February 2006, the
    Frankfurt District Court ruled to dismiss all challenges
    contesting the confirmatory resolutions and upheld only the
    challenge regarding the ratification of the acts of the members
    of the board of management and the supervisory board. CAG
    appealed the decision with respect to the ratification. Three
    plaintiff shareholders appealed the decision on the confirmatory
    resolutions, however, two plaintiff shareholders agreed in
    Settlement Agreement II (see below) to withdraw their
    actions.

CAG is also a defendant in four actions filed in the Frankfurt
    District Court requesting that the court declare some or all of
    the shareholder resolutions passed at the extraordinary general
    meeting on July 30 and 31, 2004 null and void, based
    on allegations that certain formal requirements necessary in
    connection with the invitation to the extraordinary general
    meeting had been violated. The Frankfurt District Court has
    suspended the proceedings regarding the resolutions passed at
    the

July 30-31,

2004 extraordinary general meeting described above as long as
    the lawsuits contesting the confirmatory resolutions are pending.

Based upon the information available as of February 20,
    2007, the outcome of the foregoing proceedings cannot be
    predicted with certainty.

The amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement may be
    increased in special award proceedings initiated by minority
    shareholders, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser
    can otherwise make available to the Company. As of
    March 30, 2005, several minority shareholders of CAG had
    initiated special award proceedings seeking the court’s
    review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the
    guaranteed annual payment offered under the Domination
    Agreement. As a result of these proceedings, the amount of the
    fair cash consideration and the guaranteed annual payment
    offered under the Domination Agreement could be increased by the
    court so that all minority shareholders, including those who
    have already tendered their shares into the mandatory offer and
    have received the fair cash

compensation could claim the respective higher amounts. The
    court dismissed all of these proceedings in March 2005 on the
    grounds of inadmissibility. Thirty-three plaintiffs appealed the
    dismissal, and in January 2006, twenty-three of these appeals
    were granted by the court. They were remanded back to the court
    of first instance, where the valuation will be further reviewed.
    On December 12, 2006, the court of first instance appointed
    an expert to help determine the value of CAG.

The shareholders’ resolution approving the Squeeze-Out
    passed at the shareholders’ meeting on May 30, 2006
    was challenged in June 2006 by seventeen actions to set aside
    such resolution. In addition, a null and void action was served
    upon CAG in November 2006. The Squeeze-Out, required
    registration in the commercial register and such registration
    was not possible while the lawsuits were pending. Therefore, CAG
    initiated fast track release proceedings asking the court to
    find that the lawsuits did not prevent registration of the
    Squeeze-Out. The court of first instance granted the motion
    regarding the actions to set aside the shareholders’
    resolution in a ruling dated October 10, 2006 that was
    appealed by plaintiff shareholders. In a ruling dated
    November 30, 2006, the court of first instance also granted
    the motion with respect to the null and void action.

On December 22, 2006, the Purchaser and CAG signed a
    settlement agreement with the plaintiff shareholders challenging
    the shareholders’ resolution approving the Squeeze-Out
    (“Settlement Agreement II”). Pursuant to
    Settlement Agreement II, the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw
    their actions and to drop their complaints in exchange for the
    Purchaser agreeing to pay the guaranteed dividend for the fiscal
    year ended on September 30, 2006 to those minority
    shareholders who had not yet requested early payment of such
    dividend and to pay a pro rata share of the guaranteed dividend
    for the first five months of the fiscal year ending on
    September 30, 2007 to all minority shareholders. The
    Purchaser further agreed to make a donation in the amount of
    €0.5 million to a charity, to introduce, upon request
    by plaintiffs, into the award proceedings regarding the cash
    compensation and the guaranteed dividend under the Domination
    Agreement the prospectus governing the January 20, 2005,
    listing on the NYSE of the shares of the Company and to accord
    the squeezed-out minority shareholders preferential treatment
    if, within three years after effectiveness of the Squeeze-Out,
    the shares of CAG were to be listed on a stock exchange again.
    As a result of the effective registration of the Squeeze-Out in
    the commercial register in December 2006, the Company acquired
    the remaining 2% of CAG in January 2007.

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties
    for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of
    agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements,

•

Hoechst will bear those liabilities exceeding
    €250 million, however the Company will reimburse
    Hoechst for one-third of those liabilities for amounts that
    exceed €750 million in the aggregate.

The aggregate maximum amount of environmental indemnifications
    under the remaining divestiture agreements that provide for
    monetary limits is approximately €750 million. Three
    of the divested agreements do not provide for monetary limits.

Based on the estimate of the probability of loss under this
    indemnification, the Company had reserves of $33 million
    and $33 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, for this contingency. Where the Company is unable
    reasonably to determine the probability of loss or estimate such
    loss under an indemnification, the Company has not recognized
    any related liabilities (See Note 18).

The Company has also undertaken in the Demerger Agreement to
    indemnify Hoechst to the extent that Hoechst is required to
    discharge liabilities, including tax liabilities, associated
    with businesses that were included in the demerger where such
    liabilities were not demerged, due to legal restrictions on the
    transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for
    any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not provided
    for any reserves associated with this indemnification. There
    were no payments made to Hoechst during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31,
    2004 in connection with this indemnification.

Divestiture
    Obligations

The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify
    third party purchasers of former businesses and assets for
    various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also
    include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust
    and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees
    represent standard contractual terms associated with typical
    divestiture agreements and, other than environmental
    liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the
    Company to any significant risk.

The Company and the Predecessor have divested numerous
    businesses, investments and facilities, through agreements
    containing indemnifications or guarantees to the purchasers.
    Many of the obligations contain monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, ranging from one year to thirty years. The
    aggregate amount of guarantees provided for under these
    agreements is approximately $2.3 billion as of
    December 31, 2006. Other agreements do not provide for any
    monetary or time limitations.

Based on historical claims experience and its knowledge of the
    sites and businesses involved, the Company believes that it is
    adequately reserved for these matters. As of December 31,
    2006 and 2005, the Company has reserves in the aggregate of
    $44 million and $54 million, respectively, for
    environmental matters.

Plumbing
    Insurance Indemnifications

CAG entered into agreements with insurance companies related to
    product liability settlements associated with
    Celcon

®

plumbing claims. These agreements, except those with insolvent
    insurance companies, require the Company to indemnify

and/or

defend these insurance companies in the event that third parties
    seek additional monies for matters released in these agreements.
    The indemnifications in these agreements do not provide for time
    limitations.

In certain of the agreements, CAG received a fixed settlement
    amount. The indemnities under these agreements generally are
    limited to, but in some cases are greater than, the amount
    received in settlement from the insurance company. The maximum
    exposure under these indemnifications is $95 million. Other
    settlement agreements have no stated limits.

There are other agreements whereby the settling insurer agreed
    to pay a fixed percentage of claims that relate to that
    insurer’s policies. The Company has provided
    indemnifications to the insurers for amounts paid in excess of
    the settlement percentage. These indemnifications do not provide
    for monetary or time limitations.

The Company has reserves associated with these product liability
    claims. See

Polyester
    Staple Antitrust Litigation

CNA Holdings, the successor in interest to Hoechst Celanese
    Corporation (“HCC”), CAC and CAG (collectively, the
    “Celanese Entities”) and Hoechst AG (“HAG”),
    the former parent of HCC, were named as defendants in two
    actions (involving 25 individual participants) filed in
    September 2006 by U.S. purchasers of polyester staple
    fibers manufactured and sold by HCC. The actions allege that the
    defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids
    and allocate customers of polyester staple sold in the United
    States. These actions have been consolidated for pre-trial
    discovery by a Multi-District Litigation Panel in the United
    States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina
    and are styled In re Polyester Staple Antitrust Litigation, MDL
    1516. Already pending in that consolidated proceeding are five
    other actions commenced by five other alleged
    U.S. purchasers of polyester staple fibers manufactured and
    sold by the Celanese Entities, which also allege
    defendants’ participation in the conspiracy.

In 1998 HCC sold its polyester staple business as part of its
    sale of its Film & Fibers Division to KoSa, Inc. In a
    complaint now pending against the Celanese Entities and HAG in
    the United States District Court for the Southern District of
    New York, Koch Industries, Inc., Kosa B.V. (“KoSa”),
    Arteva Specialties, S.A.R.L. (“Arteva Specialties”)
    and Arteva Services, S.A.R.L. seek, among other things,
    indemnification under the asset purchase agreement pursuant to
    which KoSa and Arteva Specialties agreed to purchase
    defendants’ polyester business for all damages related to
    the defendants’ participation in, and failure to disclose,
    the alleged conspiracy, or alternatively, rescission of the
    agreement.

Celanese does not believe that the Celanese Entities engaged in
    any conduct that should result in liability in these actions.
    However, the outcome of the foregoing actions cannot be
    predicted with certainty. We believe that any resulting
    liabilities from an adverse result will not, in the aggregate,
    have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but
    may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations
    in any given period.

Other
    Obligations

•

The Company is secondarily liable under a lease agreement
    pursuant to which the Company has assigned a direct obligation
    to a third party. The lease assumed by the third party expires
    on April 30, 2012. The lease liability for the period from
    January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2012 is estimated to be
    approximately $41 million.

•

The Company has agreed to indemnify various insurance carriers,
    for amounts not in excess of the settlements received, from
    claims made against these carriers subsequent to the settlement.
    The aggregate amount of guarantees under these settlements is
    approximately $10 million, which is unlimited in term.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the occurrence of
    unpredictable future events, the future costs associated with
    them cannot be determined at this time. However, the Company
    were to incur additional charges for these matters, such charges
    may have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows of the Company in any given
    accounting period.

Other
    Matters

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    commitments to purchase goods and services over a fixed period
    of time. The Company maintains a number of
    “take-or-pay” contracts for the purchase of raw
    materials and utilities. As of December 31, 2006, there
    were outstanding future commitments of approximately
    $2,229 million under

take-or-pay

contracts. The Company does not expect to incur any losses under
    these contractual arrangements

F-67


CELANESE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and historically has not incurred any material losses related to
    these contracts. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006,
    there were outstanding commitments relating to capital projects
    of approximately $61 million.

As of December 31, 2006, Celanese Ltd. and/or CNA Holdings,
    Inc., both U.S. subsidiaries of the Company, are defendants
    in approximately 647 asbestos cases. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, 90 new cases were filed against the
    Company and 79 cases were resolved. Because many of these cases
    involve numerous plaintiffs, the Company is subject to claims
    significantly in excess of the number of actual cases. The
    Company has reserves for defense costs related to claims arising
    from these matters. The Company believes that there is not
    significant exposure related to these matters.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
    recorded a gain of $36 million from the settlement of
    transportation-related antitrust matters. This amount was
    recorded against cost of sales.

Under the transaction and monitoring fee agreement/sponsor
    services agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify the
    Advisor and its affiliates and their respective partners,
    members, directors, officers, employees, agents and
    representatives for any and all losses relating to services
    contemplated by these agreements and the engagement of the
    Advisor pursuant to, and the performance by the Advisor or the
    services contemplated by, these agreements. The Company has also
    agreed under the transaction and monitoring fee
    agreement/sponsor services agreement to reimburse the Advisor
    and its affiliates for their expenses incurred in connection
    with the services provided under these agreements or in
    connection with their ownership or subsequent sale of Celanese
    Corporation stock (See Note 28).

The Company entered into an agreement with Goldman,
    Sachs & Co. oHG, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs and
    Co., on December 15, 2003 (the ”Goldman Sachs
    Engagement Letter”), pursuant to which Goldman Sachs acted
    as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the
    tender offer. Pursuant to the terms of the Goldman Sachs
    Engagement Letter, in March 2004, CAG paid Goldman Sachs a
    financial advisory fee equal to $13 million and a
    discretionary bonus equal to $5 million, upon consummation
    of the tender offer. In addition, CAG agreed to reimburse
    Goldman Sachs for all its reasonable expenses and to indemnify
    Goldman Sachs and related persons for all direct damages arising
    in connection with Goldman Sachs Engagement Letter.

Export
    Control Investigation

From time to time, certain of the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries made sales of acetate, sweeteners and polymer
    products to customers in countries that are or have previously
    been subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the
    U.S. government. These countries include Cuba, Iran, Sudan
    and Syria, four countries currently identified by the
    U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states and
    other countries that previously have been identified by the
    U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, or
    countries to which sales have been regulated in connection with
    other foreign policy concerns. In September 2005, the Company
    began an investigation of these transactions and initially
    identified approximately $10 million of sales by its
    foreign subsidiaries to the above-referenced countries. The
    Company now believes that approximately $5 million of these
    sales were in violation of U.S. law or regulation. The
    violations uncovered by the investigation include approximately
    $180,000 of sales of emulsions to Cuba by two of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries. Sales to Cuba are
    violations of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of
    Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, regulations. In addition, the
    Company determined that its sales office in Turkey sold polymer
    products to companies in Iran and Syria, including indirectly
    selling product through other companies located in non-embargoed
    countries. Certain of these transactions involved an intentional
    violation of the Company’s policies and federal regulations
    by employees of a subsidiary in Turkey.

The Company voluntarily disclosed these matters to the
    U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Department of
    Commerce. The Company immediately took corrective actions,
    including dismissal of responsible individuals, directives to
    senior business leaders prohibiting such sales, enhancement of
    the business conduct policy training in the area of export
    control, as well as modifications to its accounting systems that
    are intended to prevent the initiation of sales to countries
    that are subject to the U.S. Treasury Department or the
    U.S. Department of Commerce

restrictions. The Company, in conjunction with outside counsel,
    concluded an internal investigation of the facts and
    circumstances surrounding the illegal export issues. As a result
    of this investigation, the Company has terminated an employee
    and liquidated its subsidiary in Turkey. The Company
    communicated the results of its investigation to the federal
    authorities responsible for these matters.

By letter dated December 12, 2006, the U.S. Department
    of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export
    Enforcement (“OEE”) informed the Company that it had
    completed its investigation and issued a warning with respect to
    one of the transactions that the Company voluntarily disclosed.
    OEE confirmed in the warning letter that it would be closing the
    matter and decided not to assess any fines or monetary penalties
    or refer the matter for criminal or administrative prosecution.
    While neither the OEE nor the Office of Foreign Assets Controls
    (“OFAC”) has issued, or is likely to issue, a formal
    decision on all of the transactions that we disclosed to them,
    based on the advice of outside counsel we believe that OEE and
    OFAC do not intend to continue their investigations of these
    other transactions and we may consider the matters to be closed.

The Company has agreements with certain Affiliates, primarily

    those agreements.

Upon closing of the Acquisition, the Company entered into a
    transaction and monitoring fee agreement with the Advisor, an
    affiliate of the Blackstone Group (the “Sponsor”).
    Under the agreement, the Advisor agreed to provide monitoring
    services to the Company for a 12 year period. Also, the
    Advisor may receive additional compensation for providing
    investment banking or other advisory services provided to the
    Company by the Advisor or any of its affiliates, and may be
    reimbursed for certain expenses, in connection with any specific
    acquisition, divestiture, refinancing, recapitalization, or
    similar transaction. In connection with the completion of the
    initial public offering, the parties amended and restated the
    transaction and monitoring fee agreement to terminate the
    monitoring services and all obligations to pay future monitoring
    fees and paid the Advisor $35 million. The Company also
    paid $10 million to the Advisor for the 2005 monitoring
    fee. The transaction based agreement remains in effect.

CELANESE

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Also in connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued
    $200 million mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to an
    affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC. The mandatorily
    redeemable preferred shares were redeemed using the proceeds
    from the senior subordinated notes issued July 1, 2004.
    Banc of America Securities LLC was also an initial purchaser of
    the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes and
    is an affiliate of a lender under the amended and restated
    senior credit facilities. Banc of America Securities LLC is an
    affiliate of BA Capital Investors Fund, L.P., one of the
    Original Shareholders (See Note 16).

In connection with the acquisition of Vinamul, the Company paid
    the Advisor a fee of $2 million, which was included in the
    computation of the purchase price for the acquisition. In
    connection with the acquisition of Acetex, the Company paid the
    Advisor an initial fee of $1 million. Additional fees of
    $3 million were paid in August 2005 to the Advisor upon the
    successful completion of this acquisition. In addition, the
    Company has paid the Advisor aggregate fees of approximately
    €3 million (approximately $4 million) in
    connection with the Company’s acquisition of
    5.9 million additional CAG shares in August 2005 (See
    Note 2).

During the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company reimbursed the Advisor approximately $0 million and
    $2 million, respectively, for other costs.

Commencing in September 2005, the Company filed a Registration
    Statement on

Form S-1

and amendments to that Registration Statement with the SEC on
    behalf of the Original Shareholders (the “Resale
    Offering”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and
    Restated Registration Rights Agreement (“Registration
    Rights Agreement”) dated as of January 26, 2005,
    between the Company and the Original Shareholders. Pursuant to
    the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company paid
    certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Resale
    Offering, which amounted to approximately $1 million.

Consolidating
    Guarantor Financial Information

In September 2004, Crystal US Holdings 3 LLC and Crystal US Sub
    3 Corp (the “Issuers”) both wholly owned subsidiaries
    of Celanese Corporation issued senior discount notes (the
    “Notes”) for gross proceeds of $513 million (See
    Note 16). Effective March 2005, Celanese Corporation (the
    “Parent Guarantor”) guaranteed the Notes in order that
    the financial information required to be filed under the
    indenture can be filed by the Company rather than the Issuers.
    No other subsidiaries guaranteed these notes.

The Parent Guarantor was formed on February 24, 2004, and
    the Issuers were formed in September 2004. The Parent Guarantor
    and the Issuers held no assets and conducted no operations prior
    to the acquisition of the CAG Shares. Prior to the Acquisition,
    the Parent Guarantor had no independent assets or operations.
    Accordingly, there is no financial information for the Parent
    Guarantor or the Issuers for the periods prior to the nine
    months ended December 31, 2004.

The following consolidating financial statements are presented
    in the provided form because:

(i) the Issuers are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Parent
    Guarantor; (ii) the guarantee is considered to be full and
    unconditional, that is, if the Issuers fail to make a scheduled
    payment, the Parent Guarantor is obligated to make the scheduled
    payment immediately and, if they do not, any holder of notes may
    immediately bring suit directly against the Parent Guarantor for
    payment of all amounts due and payable.

Separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning
    the Parent Guarantor are not presented because the Company does
    not believe that such information is material to investors.

Prior to the completion of the initial public offering of
    Celanese Corporation Series A common stock in January 2005,
    the Company effected a 152.772947 for 1 stock split of
    outstanding shares of common stock (See Note 19).
    Accordingly, basic and diluted shares for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2004 have been calculated based on the
    weighted average shares outstanding, adjusted for the stock
    split. Earnings (loss) per share for the Predecessor periods has
    been calculated by dividing net income available to common
    shareholders by the historical weighted average shares
    outstanding of the Predecessor. As the capital structure of the
    Predecessor and Successor are different, the reported earnings
    (loss) per share are not comparable.

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    11,063,000 million and 911,000 thousand stock options,
    respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted
    earnings per share because their effect is antidilutive.

Shares issuable pursuant to outstanding common stock options
    under the Predecessor’s Stock Option Plans of 544,750 have
    been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss)
    per share for the nine months ended December 31, 2004
    because their effect is antidilutive.

31.  Relocation
    of Ticona Plant in Kelsterbach

On November 29, 2006, the Company reached a settlement with
    the Frankfurt, Germany, Airport (“Fraport”) to
    relocate its Kelsterbach, Germany, business, resolving several
    years of legal disputes related to the planned Frankfurt airport
    expansion. As a result of the settlement, the Company will
    transition Ticona’s administration and operations from
    Kelsterbach to another location in Germany by mid-2011. Over a
    five-year period, Fraport will pay Ticona a total of
    €650 million to offset the costs associated with the
    transition of the business from its current location and the
    closure of the Kelsterbach plant. As of December 31, 2006,
    Fraport has paid the Company a total of €20 million
    ($26 million) towards the transition. The amount has been
    accounted for as deferred income and is included in Other
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2006.

32.  Subsequent
    Events

On January 5, 2007, the Company declared a cash dividend on
    its 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred stock amounting to
    $2 million and a cash dividend of $0.04 per share on
    its Series A common stock amounting to $6 million.
    Both cash dividends are for the period November 1, 2006 to
    January 31, 2007 and were paid on February 1, 2007 to
    holders of record as of January 15, 2007.

Sale
    of Oxo Products and Derivatives businesses

On December 13, 2006, the Company signed a definitive
    agreement to sell its oxo products and derivatives businesses,
    including EOXO, a joint venture between CAG and Degussa (see
    Note 6), to Advent International, for a purchase price of
    €480 million subject to final agreement adjustments
    and successful exercise of the Company’s option to purchase
    Degussa’s interest. The Company anticipates the sale to be
    completed in the first quarter of 2007. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded approximately
    $8 million of expense to Gain (loss) on disposition of
    assets, net for incremental costs associated with this pending
    divestiture.

Acquisition
    of Acetate Products Limited

On January 31, 2007, the Company announced the completion
    of the acquisition of the cellulose acetate flake, tow and film
    business of Acetate Products Limited (“APL”), a
    subsidiary of Corsadi B.V. The transaction excludes the limited
    business activity in Romania as regulatory review continues and
    is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of
    2007. The purchase price for the transaction was
    £57 million ($110 million). The Company
    previously announced its intent to purchase APL in August 2006.
    This acquisition will not be material to the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations.
