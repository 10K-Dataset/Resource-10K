Competitive
    Strengths

We benefit from a number of competitive strengths, including the
    following:

Leading
    Market Positions

We believe that we are a leading global integrated producer of
    acetyls, cellulose acetate and vinyl emulsion products. Advanced
    Engineered Materials and our ventures, Polyplastics Co. Ltd.
    (“Polyplastics”) and Korea Engineering Plastics Co.,
    Ltd. (“KEPCO”), are leading producers and suppliers of
    engineered polymers in North America, Europe and the
    Asia/Pacific region. Our leadership positions are based on our
    large share of global production capacity, operating
    efficiencies, proprietary technology and competitive cost
    structures in our major products.

Proprietary
    Production Technology and Operating Expertise

Our production of acetyl products employs industry-leading
    proprietary and licensed technologies, including our proprietary
    AOPlus technology for the production of acetic acid and VAntage
    and VAntage Plus vinyl acetate


monomer technology. AOPlus enables plant capacity to be
    increased with minimal investment, while VAntage and VAntage
    Plus enable significant increases in production efficiencies,
    lower operating costs and increases in capacity at ten to
    fifteen percent of the cost of building a new plant.

Low
    Cost Producer

Our competitive cost structures are based on production and
    purchasing economies of scale, vertical integration, technical
    expertise and the use of advanced technologies.

Global
    Reach

We operate thirty-six production facilities throughout the
    world. The ventures in which we participate operate nine
    additional facilities. Our infrastructure of manufacturing
    plants, terminals and sales offices provides us with a
    competitive advantage in anticipating and meeting the needs of
    our global and local customers in well-established and growing
    markets, while our geographic diversity reduces the potential
    impact of volatility in any individual country or region. We
    have a strong, growing presence in Asia, particularly in China,
    and we have defined a strategy to continue this growth. For more
    information regarding our financial information with respect to
    our geographic areas, see Note 26 to the consolidated
    financial statements.

Strategic
    Investments

Our strategic investments, including our ventures, have enabled
    us to gain access, minimize costs and accelerate growth in new
    markets, while also generating significant cash flow and
    earnings. Our equity investments and cost investments represent
    an important component of our growth strategy. See Note 9
    to the consolidated financial statements and
    “Investments” commencing on page 14 of
    Item 1 for additional information on our equity and cost
    investments.

Diversified
    Products and End-Use Markets

We offer our customers a broad range of products in a wide
    variety of end-use markets. For example, we participate in
    paints and coatings, textiles, automotive applications, consumer
    and medical applications, performance industrial applications,
    filter media, paper and packaging, chemical additives,
    construction, consumer and industrial adhesives, and food and
    beverage applications. This product and market diversity reduces
    the potential impact of volatility in any individual market
    segment.

Business
    Strategies

Our strategic foundation is based on the following four pillars
    which are focused on increasing operating cash flows, improving
    profitability, delivering high return on investments and
    creating shareholder value:

Focus

We participate in businesses where we have a sustainable
    competitive advantage. We continue to optimize our business
    portfolio in order to achieve market, cost and technology
    leadership while expanding our product mix into higher
    value-added products.

Investment

We leverage and build on advantaged positions that optimize our
    portfolio. In order to increase our competitive advantage, we
    have invested in our core group of businesses through
    acquisitions in our Acetyls, Emulsions and Acetate businesses;
    growth in Asia bolstered by our new integrated chemical complex
    in Nanjing, China; and new applications of our advanced
    engineered polymers products.

Growth

We aggressively align with our customers and their markets to
    capture growth. We are quickly expanding in Asia, the
    fastest-growing region in the world, in order to meet increasing
    demand for our products. As part of our


growth strategy, we also continue to develop new products and
    industry-leading production technologies that deliver
    value-added solutions for our customers.

Redeployment

We divest non-core assets and revitalize underperforming
    businesses. We have divested or exited businesses where we no
    longer have a competitive advantage. We also continue to make
    key strategic decisions to revitalize businesses that have
    significant potential for improved performance and enhanced
    efficiency.

Underlying all of these strategies is a culture of execution and
    productivity. We continually seek ways to reduce costs, increase
    productivity and improve process technology. Our commitment to
    operational excellence is an integral part of our strategy to
    maintain our cost advantage and productivity leadership.

Business
    Segments

Advanced
    Engineered Materials

The Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high-performance technical
    polymers. See Item 1. Business — Segment Overview
    for discussion of key products and major end-use markets.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ technical polymers have
    chemical and physical properties enabling them, among other
    things, to withstand extreme temperatures, resist chemical
    reactions with solvents and withstand fracturing or stretching.
    These products are used in a wide range of performance-demanding
    applications in the automotive and electronics sectors as well
    as in other consumer and industrial goods. Demand for
    high-performance polymers is expected to grow approximately 5%
    to 6% per year.

Advanced Engineered Materials works in concert with its
    customers to enable innovations and develop new or enhanced
    products. Advanced Engineered Materials focuses its efforts on
    developing new markets and applications for its product lines,
    often developing custom formulations to satisfy the technical
    and processing requirements of a customer’s applications.
    For example, Advanced Engineered Materials has collaborated with
    fuel system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with the
    chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure
    to hot diesel fuels in the new generation of common rail diesel
    engines. The product can also be used in automotive fuel sender
    units where it remains stable at the high operating temperatures
    present in direct-injection diesel engines or meet the
    requirements of the new generation of bio fuels.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ customer base consists
    primarily of a large number of plastic molders and component
    suppliers, which are often the primary suppliers to original
    equipment manufacturers (“OEM”). Advanced Engineered
    Materials works with these molders and component suppliers as
    well as directly with the OEMs to develop and improve
    specialized applications and systems.

Prices for most of these products, particularly specialized
    product grades for targeted applications, generally reflect the
    value added in complex polymer chemistry, precision formulation
    and compounding, and the extensive application development
    services provided. These specialized product lines are not
    susceptible to cyclical swings in pricing.

Business
    Lines

POM is sold under the trademark Hostaform in all regions but
    North America, where it is sold under the trademark Celcon.
    Polyplastics and KEPCO are leading suppliers of POM and other
    engineering resins in the Asia/Pacific region. POM is used for
    mechanical parts, including door locks and seat belt mechanisms,
    in automotive applications and in electrical, consumer and
    medical applications such as drug delivery systems and gears for
    large appliances.

The primary raw material for POM is formaldehyde, which is
    manufactured from methanol. Advanced Engineered Materials
    currently purchases formaldehyde in the United States from our
    Acetyl Intermediates segment and, in Europe, manufactures
    formaldehyde from purchased methanol.


GUR is an engineered material used in heavy-duty automotive and
    industrial applications such as car battery separator panels and
    industrial conveyor belts, as well as in specialty medical and
    consumer applications, such as sports equipment and prostheses.
    GUR micro powder grades are used for high-performance filters,
    membranes, diagnostic devices, coatings and additives for
    thermoplastics and elastomers. GUR fibers are also used in
    protective ballistic applications.

Celstran and Compel are long fiber reinforced thermoplastics,
    which impart extra strength and stiffness, making them more
    suitable for larger parts than conventional thermoplastics.

Polyesters such as Celanex PBT, Vandar, a series of
    PBT-polyester blends and Riteflex, a thermoplastic polyester
    elastomer, are used in a wide variety of automotive, electrical
    and consumer applications, including ignition system parts,
    radiator grilles, electrical switches, appliance and sensor
    housings, LEDs and technical fibers. Raw materials for
    polyesters vary. Base monomers, such as dimethyl terephthalate
    and PTA, are widely available with pricing dependent on broader
    polyester fiber and packaging resins market conditions. Smaller
    volume specialty co-monomers for these products are typically
    supplied by a few companies.

Liquid crystal polymers (“LCP”), such as Vectra, are
    used in electrical and electronics applications and for
    precision parts with thin walls and complex shapes or on
    high-heat cookware application.

Fortron, a PPS product, is used in a wide variety of automotive
    and other applications, especially those requiring heat

and/or

chemical resistance, including fuel system parts, radiator pipes
    and halogen lamp housings, and often replaces metal in these
    demanding applications. Other possible application fields
    include non-woven filtration devices such as coal fired power
    plants. Fortron is manufactured by Fortron Industries LLC,
    Advanced Engineered Materials’

50-50

venture with Kureha Corporation of Japan.

Facilities

Advanced Engineered Materials has polymerization, compounding
    and research and technology centers in Germany, Brazil and the
    United States. On November 29, 2006, Advanced Engineered
    Materials reached a settlement with the Frankfurt, Germany,
    Airport (“Fraport”) to relocate its Kelsterbach,
    Germany, business, resolving several years of legal disputes
    related to the planned Frankfurt airport expansion. The final
    settlement agreement was signed on June 12, 2007. As a
    result of the settlement, Advanced Engineered Materials will
    transition its operations from Kelsterbach to the Hoechst
    Industrial Park in the Rhine Main area by 2011. See Note 29
    to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ sales in the Asian market
    are made mainly through its ventures, Polyplastics, KEPCO and
    Fortron Industries, which are accounted for under the equity
    method and therefore not included in Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ consolidated net sales. If Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ portion of the sales made by these ventures were
    included in the chart above, the percentage of sales sold in
    Asia/Australia would be substantially higher. A number of
    Advanced Engineered Materials’ POM customers, particularly
    in the appliance,


electrical components and certain sections of the
    electronics/telecommunications fields, have moved tooling and
    molding operations to Asia, particularly southern China. To meet
    the expected increased demand in this region, Polyplastics,
    Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company Inc. and KEPCO agreed to form a
    venture which operates a world-scale 60,000 metric ton POM
    facility in Nantong, China.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ principal customers are
    consumer product manufacturers and suppliers to the automotive
    industries. These customers primarily produce engineered
    products, and Advanced Engineered Materials collaborates with
    its customers to assist in developing and improving specialized
    applications and systems. Advanced Engineered Materials has
    long-standing relationships with most of its major customers,
    but also uses distributors for its major products, as well as a
    number of electronic marketplaces to reach a larger customer
    base. For most of Advanced Engineered Materials’ product
    lines, contracts with customers typically have a term of one to
    two years. A significant swing in the economic conditions of the
    end markets of Advanced Engineered Materials’ principal
    customers could significantly affect the demand for Advanced
    Engineered Materials’ products.

Consumer
    Specialties

The Consumer Specialties segment consists of our Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. Our Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow and acetate flake,
    which is used in the production of filter products. Our
    Nutrinova business produces and sells
    Sunett

®

,
    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceuticals
    industries. See Item 1. Business — Segment
    Overview for discussion of key products and major end-use
    markets.

Business
    Lines

Acetate tow is used primarily in cigarette filters. We produce
    acetate flake by processing wood pulp with acetic anhydride. We
    purchase wood pulp that is made from reforested trees from major
    suppliers and produce acetic anhydride internally. The acetate
    flake is then further processed into acetate fiber in the form
    of a tow band. According to the 2006 Stanford Research Institute
    International Chemical Economics Handbook, we are the
    world’s leading producer of acetate tow, including
    production of our ventures in Asia.

Sales of acetate tow products amounted to approximately 11%, 9%
    and 11% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We have an approximate 30% interest in three manufacturing
    ventures in China that produce acetate flake and tow. Our
    partner in each of the ventures is a Chinese state-owned tobacco
    entity. Flake expansion in China was completed in 2007. In
    addition, approximately 9% of our 2007 acetate tow sales were
    sold directly to China, the largest single market for acetate
    tow in the world. Tow expansions at each of the ventures were
    completed in 2005.

Nutrinova’s food ingredients business consists of the
    production and sale of high intensity sweeteners and food
    protection ingredients, such as sorbic acid and sorbates
    worldwide. Nutrinova’s food protection ingredients are
    mainly used in foods, beverages and personal care products. The
    primary raw materials for these products are ketene and
    crotonaldehyde. Sorbates pricing is extremely sensitive to
    demand and industry capacity and is not necessarily dependent on
    the prices of raw materials.

Acesulfame potassium, a high intensity sweetener marketed under
    the trademark
    Sunett

®

,
    is used in a variety of beverages, confections and dairy
    products throughout the world.
    Sunett

®

pricing for targeted applications reflects the value added by
    Nutrinova, through technical services and consistent product
    quality. Nutrinova’s strategy is to be the most reliable
    and highest quality producer of this product, to develop new
    product applications and expand into new markets. Nutrinova
    maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy, which has
    resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent
    infringement matters in Europe and the United States.

    agricultural and chemical products. See Item 1.
    Business — Segment Overview for discussion of key
    products and major end-use markets.

Business
    Lines

Acetyls.

The acetyls business line produces:

•

Acetic acid, used to manufacture VAM, other acetyl derivatives
    and various other end uses, including purified terephthalic acid
    (“PTA”). We manufacture acetic acid for our own use,
    as well as for sale to third parties, including other
    participants in the acetyl derivatives business;

•

VAM, used in a variety of adhesives, paints, films, coatings and
    textiles. We manufacture VAM for our own use, as well as for
    sale to third parties;

•

Acetic anhydride, a raw material used in the production of
    cellulose acetate, detergents and pharmaceuticals. We
    manufacture acetic anhydride for our own use, as well as for
    sale to third parties; and

•

Acetaldehyde, a major feedstock for the production of polyols.
    Acetaldehyde is also used in other organic compounds such as
    pyridines, which are used in agricultural products.

Acetic acid and VAM, our basic products, are directly impacted
    by the global supply/demand balance for each of the products and
    can be described as cyclical in nature. The principal raw
    materials in these products are natural gas and ethylene, which
    we purchase from numerous sources; carbon monoxide, which we
    purchase under long-term contracts; methanol, which we purchase
    under long-term and short-term contracts; and butane, which we
    purchase from one supplier and can also obtain from other
    sources. All these raw materials, except carbon monoxide, are
    commodities available from a wide variety of sources.

Our production of acetyl products employs leading proprietary
    and licensed technologies, including our proprietary AOPlus
    technology for the production of acetic acid and VAntage and
    VAntage Plus vinyl acetate monomer technology.

Solvents and Derivatives.

The solvents and
    derivatives business line produces a variety of solvents,
    formaldehyde and other chemicals, which in turn are used in the
    manufacture of paints, coatings, adhesives and other products.

Many solvents and derivatives products are derived from our
    production of acetic acid. Primary products are:

•

Ethyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in
    coatings, inks and adhesives and in the manufacture of
    photographic films and coated papers;

•

Butyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in inks,
    pharmaceuticals and perfume;

•

Methyl ethyl ketone, a solvent used in the production of
    printing inks and magnetic tapes;


Formaldehyde and formaldehyde derivative products are
    derivatives of methanol and are made up of the following
    products:

•

Formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, and formcels are primarily used
    to produce adhesive resins for plywood, particle board,
    coatings, POM engineering resins and a compound used in making
    polyurethane;

•

Amines such as methyl amines, monisopropynol amines and butyl
    amines are used in agrochemicals, herbicides and the treatment
    of rubber and water; and

•

Special solvents, such as crotonaldehyde, which are used by the
    Nutrinova business line for the production of sorbates, as well
    as raw materials for the fragrance and food ingredients industry.

Solvents and derivatives are commodity products characterized by
    cyclicality in pricing. The principal raw materials used in the
    solvents and derivatives business line are acetic acid, various
    alcohols, methanol, propylene, ethylene, and ammonia. We
    manufacture many of these raw materials for our own use as well
    as for sales to third parties, including our competitors in the
    solvents and derivatives business. We purchase propylene and
    ethylene from a variety of sources. We manufacture acetaldehyde
    in Europe for our own use, as well as for sale to third parties.

Sales from the acetyls products line amounted to approximately
    34%, 33% and 32% of our consolidated net sales for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales
    from the solvents and derivatives products line amounted to
    approximately 12%, 13% and 14% of our consolidated net sales for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Facilities

Acetyl Intermediates has production sites in the United States,
    China, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, the United
    Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Germany. We also
    participate in a venture in Saudi Arabia that produces methanol
    and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (“MTBE”). Over the

    and multinational customers both under multi-year contracts and
    on the basis of long-standing relationships. The customers of
    solvents and derivatives are


primarily engaged in the production of paints, coatings and
    adhesives. We manufacture formaldehyde for our own use as well
    as for sale to a few regional customers that include
    manufacturers in the wood products and chemical derivatives
    industries. The sale of formaldehyde is based on both long and
    short term agreements. Specialty solvents and amines are sold
    globally to a wide variety of customers, primarily in the
    coatings and resins and the specialty products industries. These
    products serve global markets in the synthetic lubricant,

Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities such as legal,
    accounting and treasury functions, interest income or expense
    associated with our financing activities, and the captive
    insurance companies. Our two wholly-owned captive insurance
    companies are a key component of our global risk management
    program, as well as a form of self insurance for our property,
    liability and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance
    companies issue insurance policies to our subsidiaries to
    provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the
    insurance market and to lower long-term insurance costs by
    avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory
    fees. The captive insurance companies issue insurance policies
    and coordinate claims-handling services with third-party service
    providers. They retain risk at levels approved by management and
    obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net
    risk retained. One of the captive insurance companies also
    insures certain third-party risks.

Investments

We have a significant portfolio of strategic investments,
    including a number of ventures, in Asia, North America and
    Europe. In aggregate, these strategic investments enjoy
    significant sales, earnings and cash flow. We have entered into
    these strategic investments in order to gain access to local
    markets, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we
    believe have significant future business potential. See
    Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

Major
    Equity Investments

Korea Engineering Plastics Co. Ltd.

Founded in
    1987, KEPCO is the leading producer of polyacetal in South
    Korea. Mitsubishi owns the remaining 50% of KEPCO. KEPCO
    operates a 55,000-ton annual capacity POM plant in Ulsan, South
    Korea and participates with Polyplastics and Mitsubishi Gas
    Chemical Company Inc. in a world-scale 60,000 metric ton POM
    facility in Nantong, China.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd.

Polyplastics is a
    leading supplier of engineered plastics in the Asia-Pacific
    region. Polyplastics’ principal production facilities are
    located in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and China. We believe
    Polyplastics is the largest producer and marketer of POM in the
    Asia-Pacific region.

Fortron Industries LLC.

Fortron Industries LLC
    is a leading global producer of PPS. Production facilities are
    located in Wilmington, North Carolina. We believe Fortron has
    the leading technology in linear polymer applications.

Major
    Cost Investments

National Methanol Co. (Ibn Sina).

With
    production facilities in Saudi Arabia, National Methanol Co.
    represents approximately 2% of the world’s methanol
    production capacity and is the world’s eighth largest
    producer of MTBE. Methanol and MTBE are key global commodity
    chemical products. We indirectly own a 25% interest in National
    Methanol Co., with the remainder held by SABIC (50%) and Texas
    Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. (25%). SABIC has responsibility
    for all product marketing.

China Acetate Products Ventures.

We hold
    approximately 30% ownership interests (50% board representation)
    in three separate Acetate Products production entities in China:
    the Nantong, Kunming and Zhuhai Cellulose Fiber Companies. In
    each instance, Chinese state-owned entities control the
    remainder. The ventures fund investments using operating cash
    flows.

These cost investments in which we own greater than a 20%
    ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of
    accounting because we cannot exercise significant influence, are
    not involved in the day-to-day operations and are unable to
    obtain timely financial information prepared in accordance with
    US generally accepted accounting principles (“US
    GAAP”) from these entities.

Other
    Equity Investments

InfraServs.

We hold ownership interests in
    several InfraServ groups located in Germany. InfraServs own and
    develop industrial parks and provide

on-site

general and administrative support to tenants.

Other
    Investments

In March 2007, we entered into a strategic partnership with
    Accsys Technologies PLC (“Accsys”), and its
    subsidiary, Titan Wood, to become the exclusive supplier of
    acetyl products to Titan Wood’s technology licensees for
    use in wood acetylation. In connection with this partnership, in
    May 2007, we acquired 8,115,883 shares of Accsys’
    common stock representing approximately 5.45% of the total
    voting shares of Accsys for €22 million
    ($30 million). The investment is treated as an
    available-for-sale security and is included as a component of
    current Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. On
    November 20, 2007, we, along with Accsys, announced that we
    agreed to amend our business arrangements so that each company
    will have a nonexclusive “at-will” trading and supply
    relationship to give both companies greater flexibility. As part
    of this amendment, we have the ability to sell our common stock
    ownership in Accsys through an orderly placement of our Accsys
    shares. As of December 31, 2007, we sold
    1,238,016 shares of Accsys’ common stock for
    approximately €4 million ($6 million), which
    resulted in a gain of approximately $1 million. In January
    2008, we sold an additional 1,375,573 shares of
    Accsys’ common stock for approximately €3 million
    ($5 million).

Raw
    Materials and Energy

We purchase a variety of raw materials from sources in many
    countries for use in our production processes. We have a policy
    of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for
    materials. However, some of our


individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of
    their raw materials, such as carbon monoxide, steam and
    acetaldehyde. Although we have been able to obtain sufficient
    supplies of raw materials, there can be no assurance that
    unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply.
    Even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material,
    there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the
    loss of a major supplier. There cannot be any guarantee that
    profitability will not be affected should we be required to
    qualify additional sources of supply in the event of the loss of
    a sole supplier. In addition, the price of raw materials varies,
    often substantially, from year to year.

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are
    commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply/demand
    fundamentals change. Our production facilities rely largely on
    coal, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity for energy. Most of
    the raw materials for our European operations are centrally
    purchased by our subsidiary, which also buys raw materials on
    behalf of third parties. We manage our exposure through the use
    of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for
    commodity price hedging, entering into long-term supply
    agreements and multi-year purchasing and sales agreements. As of
    December 31, 2007, we did not have any open commodity
    financial derivative contracts. See Notes 3 and 23 to the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information.

We also currently purchase and lease supplies of various
    precious metals, such as rhodium, used as catalysts for the
    manufacture of chemical products. With growing demand for these
    precious metals, most notably in the automotive industry, the
    cost to purchase or lease these precious metals has increased,
    caused by a shortage in supply. For precious metals, the leases
    are distributed between a minimum of three lessors per product
    and are divided into several contracts. Although we seek to
    offset increases in raw material prices with corresponding
    increases in the prices of our products, we may not be able to
    do so, and there may be periods when such product price
    increases lag behind raw material cost increases.

Research
    and Development

All of our businesses conduct research and development
    activities to increase competitiveness. Our businesses are
    innovation-oriented and conduct research and development
    activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production
    technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new
    products and applications. We consider the amount spent during
    each of the last three fiscal years on research and development
    activities to be adequate to drive our growth programs.

Intellectual
    Property

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    product and process developments in our major markets. Patents
    may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product
    uses. We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means
    of protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names
    become more important once the corresponding patents have
    expired. We protect our trademarks vigorously against
    infringement and also seek to register design protection where
    appropriate.

In most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new
    substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications
    and production processes. However, we do business in regions of
    the world where intellectual property protection may be limited
    and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information
    security policies and procedures wherever we do business. Such
    information security policies and procedures include data
    encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of
    confidential information, as well as employee awareness
    training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors and vigorously
    challenge patent and trademark infringement. For example, Acetyl
    Intermediates maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy,
    which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent
    infringement matters in Europe, Asia and the United States. We
    are currently pursuing a number of matters relating to the
    infringement of our acetic acid patents. Some of our earlier
    acetic acid patents expired in 2007; other patent applications
    covering acetic acid are presently pending.

Environmental
    and Other Regulation

Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in
    Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations, and Notes 17 and 24 to the consolidated
    financial statements.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    8,400 employees worldwide from continuing operations,
    compared to 8,900 as of December 31, 2006. This represents
    a decrease of approximately 6%. The decrease primarily relates
    to acquisitions and divestitures during 2007. See Note 5 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional
    information. The following table sets forth the approximate
    number of employees on a continuing basis as of
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Many of our employees are unionized, particularly in Germany,
    Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Belgium and France. However, in the
    United States, less than one quarter of our employees are
    unionized. Moreover, in Germany and France, wages and general
    working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated
    collective bargaining agreements. Within the limits established
    by these agreements, our various subsidiaries negotiate directly
    with the unions and other labor organizations, such as
    workers’ councils, representing the employees. Collective
    bargaining agreements between the German chemical employers
    associations and unions relating to remuneration typically have
    a term of one year, while in the United States a three year term
    for collective bargaining agreements is typical. We offer
    comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and
    believe our relations with employees are satisfactory.

Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the
    level of future sales activity. In general, we do not
    manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production
    and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders
    as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe
    that backlog information is not material to understanding our
    overall business and should not be considered a reliable
    indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of
    revenue or financial performance.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Many factors could have an effect on our financial condition,
    cash flows and results of operations. We are subject to various
    risks resulting from changing economic, environmental,
    political, industry, business and financial conditions. The
    factors described below represent our principal risks.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    a company with operations around the world and are exposed to
    general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks
    in the countries in which we have significant
    operations.

We operate in the global market and have customers in many
    countries. We have major facilities primarily located in North
    America, Europe and Asia, and hold interests in ventures that
    operate in Germany, China, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
    Our principal customers are similarly global in scope, and the
    prices of our most significant products are typically world
    market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results
    are affected, directly and indirectly, by world economic,
    political and regulatory conditions.

Conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war,
    terrorist activities, epidemics, pandemics or political
    instability in any of the countries in which we operate could
    affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery
    of raw materials and products, as well as increasing security
    costs, insurance premiums and other expenses. These conditions
    could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the
    United States, Europe, Asia or elsewhere. Moreover, changes in
    laws or regulations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory
    requirements (including import or export licensing
    requirements), or changes in the reporting requirements of the
    United States, German or European Union governmental agencies,
    could increase the cost of doing business in these regions. Any
    of these conditions may have an effect on our business and
    financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current
    and future prices for our securities, including our stock.

In particular, we have invested significant resources in China
    and other Asian countries. We anticipate that this region will
    experience significant growth in the coming years; however, if
    this region’s growth is slower than we anticipate, we may
    fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our
    investment there and our financial results may be adversely
    impacted.

The
    industries of many of our customers, particularly the
    automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries are
    cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in economic
    conditions. A downturn in one or more of these industries may
    result in a reduction in our operating margins or in operating
    losses.

Some of the markets in which our customers participate, such as
    the automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries,
    are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us which is beyond
    our control. These markets are highly competitive, to a large
    extent driven by end-use markets, and may experience
    overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of
    our products.


We are
    subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the
    prices and availability of key raw materials and
    energy.

We purchase significant amounts of natural gas, ethylene,
    butane, methanol and propylene from third parties for use in our
    production of basic chemicals in the Acetyl Intermediates
    segment, principally formaldehyde, acetic acid and VAM. We use a
    portion of our output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in
    the production of further products in all our segments. We also
    purchase significant amounts of cellulose or wood pulp for use
    in our production of cellulose acetate in the Consumer
    Specialties segment. The price of many of these items is
    dependent on the available supply of such item and may increase
    significantly as a result of production disruptions or strikes.
    For example, the unplanned shutdown of our Clear Lake, Texas
    facility together with other tight supply conditions caused a
    shortage of acetic acid and increased the price for such product
    during 2007. In addition, prices of natural gas and oil
    increased dramatically in 2007 and 2006 for reasons outside of
    our control.

We own or lease supplies of various precious metals, such as
    rhodium, used as catalysts for the production of these
    chemicals. With growing demand for these precious metals, most
    notably in the automotive industry, the cost to purchase or
    lease these precious metals has increased, caused by a shortage
    in supply.

We are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw
    materials and energy. Although we have agreements providing for
    the supply of natural gas, ethylene, propylene, wood pulp,
    electricity, coal and fuel oil, the contractual prices for these
    raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be
    highly volatile. Factors which have caused volatility in our raw
    material prices in the past and which may do so in the future
    include:

•

Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from
    growing uses or new uses;

•

Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, strike
    action or involuntary shutdowns;

•

The general level of business and economic activity; and

•

The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.

If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy
    and raw material costs, or if such commodities were unavailable,
    it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial
    results.

Failure
    to develop new products and production technologies or to
    implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives
    successfully may harm our competitive position.

Our operating results, especially in our Consumer Specialties
    and Advanced Engineered Materials segments, depend significantly
    on the development of commercially viable new products, product
    grades and applications, as well as production technologies. If
    we are unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and
    production processes in the future, our competitive position and
    operating results may be negatively affected. Likewise, we have
    undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all
    segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate
    cost savings. These initiatives may not be completed or
    beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities
    may not be realized.

Environmental
    regulations and other obligations relating to environmental
    matters could subject us to liability for fines,

clean-ups

and other damages, require us to incur significant costs to
    modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and
    delivery costs.

Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and potential obligations with respect to
    contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our
    operating results. These include obligations related to sites
    currently or formerly owned or operated by us, or where waste
    from our operations was disposed. We also have obligations
    related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and
    transfer agreement between CAG and Hoechst, also referred to as
    the demerger agreement, for environmental matters arising out of
    certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates — Environmental
    Liabilities” and Notes 17 and 24 to the consolidated
    financial statements.


Our operations are subject to extensive international, national,
    state, local, and other supranational laws and regulations that
    govern environmental and health and safety matters, including
    the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) and the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”). We
    incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these
    requirements. If we violate them, we can be held liable for
    substantial fines and other sanctions, including limitations on
    our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of
    environmental permits involved. Stricter environmental, safety
    and health laws, regulations and enforcement policies could
    result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations
    on our operations and could subject our handling, manufacture,
    use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more
    rigorous scrutiny than at present. Consequently, compliance with
    these laws and regulations could result in significant capital
    expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, which could
    cause our business and operating results to be less favorable
    than expected.

We are also involved in several claims, lawsuits and
    administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. An
    adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our
    earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period.

Changes
    in environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements
    could lead to a decrease in demand for our
    products.

New or revised governmental regulations relating to health,
    safety and the environment may also affect demand for our
    products.

Pursuant to the European Union regulation on Risk Assessment of
    Existing Chemicals, the European Chemicals Bureau of the
    European Commission has been conducting risk assessments on
    approximately 140 major chemicals. The chemicals being evaluated
    include VAM, which we produce. These risk assessments entail a
    multi-stage process to determine the risk posed by manufacturing
    and handling the product. In the case of VAM, we expect the
    finalized evaluation by mid 2008. We and other VAM producers are
    participating in this evaluation process with detailed
    scientific analyses. We cannot predict the outcome or effect of
    any final ruling.

In a separate process, in September 2007 the EU-Working group on
    classification and labelling of dangerous substances under
    Directive 67/548/EEC agreed that VAM should be classified in the
    EU as showing limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect
    (category 3 carcinogen). This classification and related
    labelling requirement should apply only to finished products
    that contain more than 10.000 parts per million of free monomer.

Several studies have investigated possible links between
    formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia.
    The International Agency for Research on Cancer or IARC
    reclassified formaldehyde from Group 2A (probable human
    carcinogen) to Group 1 (known human carcinogen) based on studies
    linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare
    cancer in humans. IARC also concluded that there is insufficient
    evidence for a causal association between leukemia and
    occupational exposure to formaldehyde, although it also
    characterized evidence for such an association as strong. The
    results of IARC’s review will be examined by government
    agencies with responsibility for setting worker and
    environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements. We
    are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from
    formaldehyde. We are participating together with other producers
    and users in the evaluations of these findings. We cannot
    predict the final effect of IARC’s reclassification.

The Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of
    Chemicals (“REACH”), a chemicals policy, became
    effective in the European Union on June 1, 2007. REACH
    established a system to register and evaluate chemicals
    manufactured in, or imported to, the European Union. Additional
    testing, documentation and risk assessments of various chemicals
    will occur across the chemical industry. Some chemical products
    may have to be taken off the market. As a result of REACH, we
    are likely to incur additional costs to test, document and
    register products used

and/or

manufactured by us. In addition, potential litigation arising
    from REACH may adversely affect our operations and financial
    results by imposing other additional costs on us

and/or

restricting our ability to import or export certain chemical
    products.

Other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological
    testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals,
    including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives
    include the Voluntary Children’s


Chemical Evaluation Program and High Production Volume Chemical
    Initiative in the United States, as well as various European
    Commission programs, such as the European Environment and Health
    Strategy (“SCALE”).

The above-mentioned assessments in the United States and Europe
    may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved
    and additional requirements being placed on the production,
    handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such
    concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost
    incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and
    otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a
    decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand
    would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results
    of operations.

Our
    production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and
    hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that
    could have a negative effect on our operating
    results.

Our operations are subject to operating risks associated with
    chemical manufacturing, including the related storage and
    transportation of raw materials, products and waste. These risks
    include, among other things, pipeline and storage tank leaks and
    ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or releases of
    toxic or hazardous substances.

These operating risks can cause personal injury, property damage
    and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown
    of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal
    penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt
    production and have a negative effect on the productivity and
    profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our
    operating results and cash flows.

Production
    at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety
    of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our
    products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’
    demands.

A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could
    have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions
    could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters,
    weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems,
    disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government
    regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient
    capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost
    substantially more or may take a significant time to start
    production, each of which could negatively affect our business
    and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing
    facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended
    period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused
    by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our
    customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek other
    suppliers. For example, during 2007, production was disrupted
    for an extended period of time at our Clear Lake, Texas facility
    that produces primarily acetic acid and VAM. The disruption was
    caused by an unplanned outage of our acetic acid unit. Because
    of this disruption, the volumes of our Acetyl Intermediates
    segment were lower than we had expected for 2007 as we were
    unable to fully offset the lost production. Similar outages
    could occur in the future from unexpected disruptions at any of
    our other manufacturing facilities of key products. Such outages
    could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in
    future reporting periods.

We may
    experience unexpected difficulties in the relocation of our
    Ticona operations from Kelsterbach to the Rhine Main area, which
    may increase our costs, delay the transition or disrupt our
    ability to supply our customers.

We have agreed with Fraport to relocate our Kelsterbach, Germany
    business, resolving several years of legal disputes related to
    the planned Frankfurt airport expansion. As a result of the
    settlement, we will transition Ticona’s operations from
    Kelsterbach to another location in Germany by mid-2011. In July
    2007, we announced that we would relocate the Kelsterbach,
    Germany business to the Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine
    Main area. Over a five-year period, Fraport will pay Ticona a
    total of €670 million to offset the costs associated
    with the transition of the business from its current location
    and the closure of the Kelsterbach plant. While the settlement
    and related payment amount are meant to be cost-neutral and
    represent the actual amount we will require to select a site,
    build new production facilities, demolish old production
    facilities and transition business activities according to
    schedule and without any disruptions to customer supply, we may
    encounter unexpected costs or other difficulties during the
    relocation process that bring the total costs of the relocation
    to an amount greater than the compensation provided


by Fraport. The relocation of these facilities represents a
    major logistical undertaking, and we may have underestimated the
    amount that will be required to carry out every aspect of the
    relocation. We may lose the services of valuable experienced
    employees during the transition if they decide not to work at
    the new location. The construction of the new facilities may not
    be complete on time or may face cost overruns. If our costs
    relating to the relocation exceed the amount of payments from
    Fraport or if the relocation causes other unexpected
    difficulties, our expenses may increase or supplies to our
    customers may be disrupted.

If supply to our customers is disrupted for an extended period,
    this could negatively impact the reputation of this business and
    result in the loss of customers. Such effects could have an
    adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods.

Recent
    federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain
    chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be
    proposed in the future could, if passed into law, require us to
    relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to
    alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical
    products, thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Regulations have recently been issued by the Department of
    Homeland Security (“DHS”) aimed at decreasing the
    risk, and effects, of potential terrorist attacks on chemical
    plants located within the United States. Pursuant to these
    regulations, these goals would be accomplished in part through
    the requirement that certain high-priority facilities develop a
    prevention, preparedness, and response plan after conducting a
    vulnerability assessment. In addition, companies may be required
    to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals
    and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and
    prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in
    order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a
    terrorist attack. We have registered certain of our sites with
    DHS in accordance with these regulations, however, DHS has not
    yet completed its risk assessment for our sites and until that
    is done we cannot state with certainty the costs associated with
    any security plans that DHS may require. These regulations may
    be revised further, and additional legislation may be proposed
    in the future on this topic. It is possible that such future
    legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than
    what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to
    us. We cannot predict the final form of currently pending
    legislation, or other related legislation that may be passed and
    can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations in a future
    reporting period.

Our
    significant non-US operations expose us to global exchange rate
    fluctuations that could adversely impact our
    profitability.

We are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial
    operations. Our market risk consists principally of exposure to
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and
    commodity prices. As we conduct a significant portion of our
    operations outside the United States, fluctuations in currencies
    of other countries, especially the Euro, may materially affect
    our operating results. For example, changes in currency exchange
    rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of
    our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets
    and increase the cost of items required in our operations.

A substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in
    currencies other than the US dollar. In our consolidated
    financial statements, we translate our local currency financial
    results into US dollars based on average exchange rates
    prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the
    end of that period. During times of a strengthening US dollar,
    at a constant level of business, our reported international
    sales, earnings, assets and liabilities will be reduced because
    the local currency will translate into fewer US dollars.

In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency
    transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries
    enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a
    currency different from the operating subsidiary’s
    functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we
    may not be able to manage our currency transaction and
    translation risks effectively, and volatility in currency
    exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of
    operations to a significant additional risk. Since a portion of
    our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other
    than US dollars, a weakening of the US dollar could make it more
    difficult for us to repay our indebtedness.


We use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign
    currency fluctuations, but we cannot guarantee that our hedging
    strategies will be effective. Failure to effectively manage
    these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

Significant
    changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions
    relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the
    valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension
    plans, and our pension cost.

The cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of
    time and involve many uncertainties during those periods of
    time. Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan
    assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present
    value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is
    materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension
    obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those
    obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment
    performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets
    can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the
    valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in
    a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. A change
    in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or
    decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the
    reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net
    periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. In recent
    years, an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has
    been implemented to minimize the influence of liability
    volatility due to interest rate movements. Similarly, changes in
    the expected return on plan assets can result in significant
    changes in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal
    years. If the value of our pension fund’s portfolio
    declines or does not perform as expected or if our experience
    with the fund leads us to change our assumptions regarding the
    fund, we may be required to contribute additional capital to the
    fund.

Our
    future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Our inability to enforce these
    rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position
    and our profit margins.

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    product and process developments in our major markets. Patents
    may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product
    uses. Protection for individual products extends for varying
    periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing
    and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The
    protection afforded, which may also vary from country to
    country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of
    coverage. As patents expire, the products and processes
    described and claimed in those patents become generally
    available for use by the public. We also seek to register
    trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names
    of our products, which brand names become more important once
    the corresponding patents have expired. Our continued growth
    strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual
    property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. If
    we are not successful in protecting our trademark or patent
    rights, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows may
    be adversely affected.

Provisions
    in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation
    and second amended and restated bylaws, as well as any
    shareholders’ rights plan, may discourage a takeover
    attempt.

Provisions contained in our second amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more
    difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
    might be beneficial to our shareholders. Provisions of our
    second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which
    could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain
    corporate actions. For example, our second amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors
    to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and
    restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any
    vote or action by our shareholders. Thus, our Board of Directors
    can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or
    conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or
    other rights of holders of our Series A common stock. These
    rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of
    control of our company. In addition, a change of control of our
    company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having
    three classes of directors (each class


elected for a three year term) or as a result of any
    shareholders’ rights plan that our Board of Directors may
    adopt. These provisions could limit the price that certain
    investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
    our Series A common stock.

Risks
    Related to the Acquisition of CAG

The
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss
    transfer agreement (“Domination Agreement”) may be
    increased, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser can
    otherwise make available to us.

Several minority shareholders of CAG have initiated special
    award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts
    of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual
    payment offered under the Domination Agreement. On
    March 14, 2005, the Frankfurt District Court dismissed on
    grounds of inadmissibility the motions of all minority
    shareholders regarding the initiation of these special award
    proceedings. In January 2006, the Frankfurt Higher District
    Court ruled that the appeals were admissible, and the
    proceedings will therefore continue. On December 12, 2006,
    the Frankfurt District Court appointed an expert to help
    determine the value of CAG. As a result of these proceedings,
    the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment could be increased by the court, and the
    Purchaser would be required to make such payments within two
    months after the publication of the court’s ruling. Any
    such increase may be substantial. All minority shareholders
    would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts. This
    may reduce the funds the Purchaser can make available to us and,
    accordingly, diminish our ability to make payments on our
    indebtedness. See Notes 2 and 24 to the consolidated
    financial statements for further information.

The
    Purchaser may be required to compensate CAG for annual losses,
    which may reduce the funds the Purchaser can otherwise make
    available to us.

Under the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser is required, among
    other things, to compensate CAG for any annual loss incurred,
    determined in accordance with German accounting requirements, by
    CAG at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was
    incurred. This obligation to compensate CAG for annual losses
    will apply during the entire term of the Domination Agreement.
    If CAG incurs losses during any period of the operative term of
    the Domination Agreement and if such losses lead to an annual
    loss of CAG at the end of any given fiscal year during the term
    of the Domination Agreement, the Purchaser will be obligated to
    make a corresponding cash payment to CAG to the extent that the
    respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the
    dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of CAG
    during the term of the Domination Agreement. The Purchaser may
    be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to CAG by off-setting
    against such loss compensation claims by CAG any valuable
    counterclaims against CAG that the Purchaser may have. If the
    Purchaser is obligated to make cash payments to CAG to cover an
    annual loss, we may not have sufficient funds to make payments
    on our indebtedness when due and, unless the Purchaser is able
    to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of CAG,
    the Purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund
    such shortfall. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements.

We and
    two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with
    respect to the Purchaser’s obligation under the
    Domination Agreement and intercompany indebtedness to CAG, which
    may diminish our ability to make payments on our
    indebtedness.

Our subsidiaries, Celanese International Holdings Luxembourg
    S.à r.l. (“CIH”), formerly Celanese Caylux
    Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A., and Celanese US, have each agreed to
    provide the Purchaser with financing so that the Purchaser is at
    all times in a position to completely meet its obligations
    under, or in connection with, the Domination Agreement. In
    addition, Celanese has guaranteed (i) that the Purchaser
    will meet its obligation under the Domination Agreement to
    compensate CAG for any annual loss incurred by CAG during the
    term of the Domination Agreement; and (ii) the repayment of
    all existing intercompany indebtedness of Celanese’s
    subsidiaries to CAG. Further, under the terms of Celanese’s
    guarantee, in certain limited circumstances CAG may be entitled
    to require the immediate repayment of some or all of the
    intercompany indebtedness owed by Celanese’s subsidiaries
    to CAG. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under their
    obligations to the Purchaser or CAG, as the case may be, or if
    the intercompany indebtedness owed to CAG is accelerated, we may
    not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when
    due.


Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness

Our
    level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise
    additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to
    react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and
    prevent us from meeting obligations under our
    indebtedness.

Our total indebtedness is approximately $3.6 billion as of
    December 31, 2007.

Our debt could have important consequences, including:

•

increasing vulnerability to general economic and industry
    conditions;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service
    requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other
    purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who have less debt.

Our
    variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk,
    which could cause our debt service obligations to increase
    significantly and affect our operating results.

Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and
    expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to
    increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate
    indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed
    remained the same. On April 2, 2007, we, through certain of
    our subsidiaries, entered into a new senior credit agreement.
    The new senior credit agreement consists of $2,280 million
    of US dollar denominated and €400 million of Euro
    denominated term loans due 2014, a $650 million revolving
    credit facility terminating in 2013 and a $228 million
    credit-linked revolving facility terminating in 2014. Borrowings
    under the new senior credit agreement bear interest at a
    variable interest rate based on LIBOR (for US dollars) or
    EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable, or, for US dollar
    denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in
    each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for
    the term loans and any loans under the credit-linked revolving
    facility is 1.75%, subject to potential reductions as defined in
    the new senior credit agreement. The term loans under the new
    senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the
    initial principal amount per annum, payable quarterly,
    commencing in July 2007. The remaining principal amount of the
    term loans will be due on April 2, 2014.

If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations
    on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the
    amount borrowed remains the same. As of December 31, 2007,
    we had approximately $2.3 billion, €525 million
    and CNY1.2 billion of variable rate debt, of which
    $1.6 billion and €150 million is hedged with
    interest rate swaps, which leaves us approximately
    $692 million, €375 million and
    CNY1.2 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest
    rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1% increase in interest rates
    would increase annual interest expense by approximately
    $14 million. There can be no assurance that interest rates
    will not rise significantly in the future. Such an increase
    could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations
    and cash flows.

Despite
    our current debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to
    incur substantially more debt.

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in
    the future. The terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit
    us from doing so. If new debt, including amounts available under
    our senior credit agreement, is added to our current debt
    levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Liquidity — Contractual
    Obligations.”


We may
    not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our
    indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy
    obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be
    successful.

Our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand,
    receipt of additional capital, including possible additional
    borrowings, and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of
    distributions, advances or cash payments. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Liquidity — Contractual
    Obligations.”

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on the financial condition and
    operating performance of our subsidiaries, which is subject to
    prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain
    financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may
    not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
    activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
    premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or
    delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital
    or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such
    operating results and resources, we could face substantial
    liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material
    assets or operations to meet our debt service and other
    obligations. The senior credit agreement governing our
    indebtedness restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use
    the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to
    consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we
    could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate
    to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Restrictive
    covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to
    engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to
    make payments on our indebtedness.

The senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains
    various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified
    types of transactions. The covenants contained in the senior
    credit agreement limit our ability to, among other things, incur
    additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other
    distributions on or repurchase capital stock or make other
    restricted payments, make investments and sell certain assets.

In addition, the senior credit agreement contains covenants that
    require us to maintain a specified financial ratio if there is
    outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility.
    Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be
    affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to
    meet those tests at all. A breach of any of these covenants
    could result in a default under the senior credit agreement.
    Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior
    credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts
    outstanding under the senior credit agreement to be immediately
    due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further
    credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders
    under the senior credit agreement could proceed against the
    collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Our
    subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as
    collateral under the senior credit agreement. If the lenders
    under the senior credit agreement accelerate the repayment of
    borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts
    borrowed under the senior credit agreement as well as their
    other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect
    on the value of our stock.

The
    terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of BCP
    Crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise
    transfer their assets to us.

Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our
    ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the
    distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, the terms
    of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of BCP Crystal
    and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer
    their assets to us. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on
    our stock is similarly limited.

    environment. While it is impossible at this time to determine
    with certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims, we believe, based on the advice of legal
    counsel, that adequate provisions have been made and that the
    ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, but may have a material adverse effect on
    the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting
    period. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial

Holders

No shares of Celanese’s Series B common stock are
    issued and outstanding. As of February 20, 2008, there were
    76 holders of record of our Series A common stock, and one
    holder of record of our perpetual preferred stock. By including
    persons holding shares in broker accounts under street names,
    however, we estimate our shareholder base to be approximately
    46,500 as of February 20, 2008.

Dividend
    Policy

In July 2005, our Board of Directors adopted a policy of
    declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash
    dividend on each share of our Series A common stock at an
    annual rate of $0.16 per share unless our Board of Directors, in
    its sole discretion, determines otherwise. Pursuant to this
    policy, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.04 per share on
    February 1, 2007, May 1, 2007, August 1, 2007,
    November 1, 2007 and February 1, 2008 and similar
    quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2006. The annual cash
    dividend declared and paid during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 were approximately
    $25 million and $26 million, respectively. Based on
    the number of outstanding shares of our Series A common
    stock, the anticipated annual cash dividend in 2008 is
    approximately $24 million. However, there is no assurance
    that sufficient cash will be available in the future to pay such
    dividend. Further, such dividends payable to holders of our
    Series A common stock cannot be declared or paid nor can
    any funds be set aside for the payment thereof, unless we have
    paid or set aside funds for the payment of all accumulated and
    unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of our preferred
    stock, as described below. Our Board of Directors may, at any
    time, modify or revoke our dividend policy on our Series A
    common stock.

We are required under the terms of the preferred stock to pay
    scheduled quarterly dividends, subject to legally available
    funds. For so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding,
    (1) we will not declare, pay or set apart funds for the
    payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to
    any junior stock or parity stock and (2) neither we, nor
    any of our subsidiaries, will, subject to certain exceptions,
    redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration junior
    stock or parity stock through a sinking fund or otherwise, in
    each case unless we have paid or set apart funds for the payment
    of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the
    shares of preferred stock and any parity stock for all preceding
    dividend periods. Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly
    dividends of


$0.265625 on our 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred stock on
    February 1, 2007, May 1, 2007, August 1, 2007,
    November 1, 2007 and February 1, 2008 and similar
    quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2006. The anticipated
    annual cash dividend is approximately $10 million.

The amount available to us to pay cash dividends is restricted
    by our senior credit agreement. Any decision to declare and pay
    dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our
    Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our
    results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition,
    contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of
    Directors may deem relevant.

Under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends
    only to the extent of our “surplus” (which is defined
    as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities,
    minus statutory capital), or if there is no surplus, out of our
    net profits for the then current

and/or

immediately preceding fiscal years. The value of a
    corporation’s assets can be measured in a number of ways
    and may not necessarily equal their book value. The value of our
    capital may be adjusted from time to time by our Board of
    Directors but in no event will be less than the aggregate par
    value of our issued stock. Our Board of Directors may base this
    determination on our financial statements, a fair valuation of
    our assets or another reasonable method. Our Board of Directors
    will seek to assure itself that the statutory requirements will
    be met before actually declaring dividends. In future periods,
    our Board of Directors may seek opinions from outside valuation
    firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient
    to allow payment of dividends, and such opinions may not be
    forthcoming. If we sought and were not able to obtain such an
    opinion, we likely would not be able to pay dividends. In
    addition, pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are
    prohibited from paying a dividend on our Series A common
    stock unless all payments due and payable under the preferred
    stock have been made.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities

In December 2007, we adopted a deferred compensation plan
    whereby we offered certain of our senior employees and directors
    the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation in
    exchange for a future payment amount equal to their deferments
    plus or minus certain amounts based upon the market-performance
    of specified measurement funds selected by the participant.
    These deferred compensation obligations may be considered
    securities of Celanese. Participants were required to make
    deferral elections under the plan in December 2007, and such
    deferrals will be withheld from their compensation during the
    year ending December 31, 2008. This plan became effective
    on January 1, 2008. We relied on the exemption from
    registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    in making this offer to a select group of employees, fewer than
    35 of which were non-accredited investors under the rules
    promulgated by the Commission.

Selected
    Financial Data

The balance sheet data shown below as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the statements of operations and cash flow data
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, all
    of which are set forth below, are derived from the consolidated
    financial statements included elsewhere in this document and
    should be read in conjunction with those financial statements
    and the notes thereto. The balance sheet data as of
    December 31, 2005 and the statements of operations and cash
    flow data for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and
    the three months ended March 31, 2004 shown below was
    derived from our 2006 Annual Report on

Form 10-K

filed with the SEC on February 21, 2007, adjusted for
    applicable discontinued operations. The statement of operations
    and cash flow data for the year ended December 31, 2003 and
    the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2003 set forth
    below, have been derived from, and translated into US dollars
    based on, CAG’s historical Euro audited financial
    statements and the underlying accounting records, adjusted for
    applicable discontinued operations.

The balance sheet, statement of operations and cash flow data
    for periods prior to April 1, 2004 in the tables below
    represent the results of the Predecessor, which refers to CAG
    and its consolidated subsidiaries. The balance sheet, statement
    of operations and cash flow data for periods subsequent to
    April 1, 2004 in the tables below represent the results of
    the Successor, which refers to Celanese Corporation and its
    consolidated subsidiaries. The results of the Successor are not
    comparable to the results of the Predecessor due to the
    difference in the basis of presentation of purchase accounting
    as compared to historical cost. Furthermore, the Successor and
    the Predecessor have different accounting policies with respect
    to certain matters.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

In this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the term “Celanese” refers to Celanese Corporation, a
    Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the
    “Company,” “we,” “our” and
    “us” refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a
    consolidated basis. The term “Celanese US” refers to
    our subsidiary Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
    liability company, formally known as BCP Crystal US Holdings
    Corp., a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The
    term “Purchaser” refers to our subsidiary, Celanese
    Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known as BCP
    Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG, a German limited
    partnership, and not its subsidiaries, except where otherwise
    indicated. The term “Original Shareholders” refers,
    collectively, to Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 1,
    Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 2, Blackstone Capital
    Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 3 and BA Capital Investors Sidecar Fund,
    L.P. The term “Advisor” refers to Blackstone
    Management Partners, an affiliate of The Blackstone Group.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of the
    financial condition and the results of operations together with
    the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes
    to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“US GAAP”).

Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements
    contained in this section involve both risk and uncertainty.
    Several important factors could cause actual results to differ
    materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of
    these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore,
    beyond the control of management. See “Forward-Looking
    Statements May Prove Inaccurate” below.

Reconciliation of Non-US GAAP Measures:  We
    believe that using non-US GAAP financial measures to supplement
    US GAAP results is useful to investors because such use provides
    a more complete understanding of the factors and trends
    affecting the business other than disclosing US GAAP results
    alone. In this regard, we disclose net debt, which is a non-US
    GAAP financial measure. Net debt is defined as total debt less
    cash and cash equivalents. We use net debt to evaluate the
    capital structure. Net debt is not a substitute for any US GAAP
    financial measure. In addition, calculations of net debt
    contained in this report may not be consistent with that of
    other companies. The most directly comparable financial measure
    presented in accordance with US GAAP in our financial statements
    for net debt is total debt. For a reconciliation of net debt to
    total debt, see “Financial Highlights” below. For a
    reconciliation of trade working capital to working capital
    components, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

Forward-Looking
    Statements May Prove Inaccurate

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and other
    parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking
    statements and information relating to us that are based on the
    beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and
    information currently available to, us. When used in this
    document, words such as “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “plan” and “project” and
    similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to
    identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect
    our current views with respect to future events, are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
    uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Further, certain
    forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to
    future events that may not prove to be accurate. We assume no
    obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements
    for any reason, except as required by law.

See the Risk Factors section under Part 1, Item 1A for
    a description of risk factors that could significantly affect
    our financial results. In addition, the following factors could
    cause our actual results to differ materially from those
    results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors
    include, among other things:

•

changes in general economic, business, political and regulatory
    conditions in the countries or regions in which we operate;

•

the length and depth of product and industry business cycles
    particularly in the automotive, electrical, electronics and
    construction industries;


•

changes in the price and availability of raw materials,
    particularly changes in the demand for, supply of, and market
    prices of fuel oil, natural gas, coal, electricity and
    petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene and butane;

•

the ability to pass increases in raw material prices on to
    customers or otherwise improve margins through price increases;

•

the ability to maintain plant utilization rates and to implement
    planned capacity additions and expansions;

•

the ability to reduce production costs and improve productivity
    by implementing technological improvements to existing plants;

•

increased price competition and the introduction of competing
    products by other companies;

•

changes in the degree of intellectual property and other legal
    protection afforded to our products;

•

compliance costs and potential disruption or interruption of
    production due to accidents or other unforeseen events or delays
    in construction of facilities;

•

potential liability for remedial actions under existing or
    future environmental regulations;

•

potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation,
    or from changes in the laws, regulations or policies of
    governments or other governmental activities in the countries in
    which we operate;

•

changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates; and

•

various other factors, both referenced and not referenced in
    this document.

Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are,
    therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks
    or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions
    prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements
    may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report
    as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned
    or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to
    update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
    their dates.

Overview

We are a leading global integrated producer of chemicals and
    advanced materials. We are one of the world’s largest
    producers of acetyl products, which are intermediate chemicals
    for nearly all major industries, as well as a leading global
    producer of high performance engineered polymers that are used
    in a variety of high-value end-use applications. As an industry
    leader, we hold geographically balanced global positions and
    participate in diversified end-use markets. Our operations are
    primarily located in North America, Europe and Asia. We combine
    a demonstrated track record of execution, strong performance
    built on shared principles and objectives, and a clear focus on
    growth and value creation.

Sale
    of Oxo Products and Derivatives Businesses

In connection with our strategy to optimize our portfolio and
    divest non-core operations, we announced on December 13,
    2006 our agreement to sell our Acetyl Intermediates
    segment’s oxo products and derivatives businesses,
    including European Oxo GmbH (“EOXO”), a 50/50 venture
    between Celanese GmbH (formerly known as Celanese AG) and
    Degussa AG (“Degussa”), to Advent International, for a
    purchase price of €480 million ($636 million)
    subject to final agreement adjustments and the successful
    exercise of our option to purchase Degussa’s 50% interest
    in EOXO. On February 23, 2007, the option was exercised and
    we acquired Degussa’s interest in the venture for a
    purchase price of €30 million ($39 million), in
    addition to €22 million ($29 million) paid to
    extinguish EOXO’s debt upon closing of the transaction. We
    completed the sale of our oxo products and derivatives
    businesses, including the acquired 50% interest in EOXO, on
    February 28, 2007. The transaction resulted in the
    recognition of a $47 million pre-tax gain, which includes
    certain working capital and other adjustments, in 2007. The
    divestiture of the oxo products and derivatives businesses has
    been accounted for as a discontinued operation. See Note 5
    to the consolidated financial statements for additional
    information.


Sale
    of AT Plastics’ Films Business

On August 20, 2007, we sold our Films business of AT
    Plastics, located in Edmonton and Westlock, Alberta, Canada, to
    British Polythene Industries PLC (“BPI”) for
    $12 million. The Films business manufactures products for
    the agricultural, horticultural and construction industries. We
    recorded a loss on the sale of $7 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2007. We maintained ownership of the
    Polymers business of AT Plastics, which concentrates on the
    development and supply of specialty resins and compounds. AT
    Plastics is included in our Industrial Specialties segment. We
    concluded that the sale of our Films business of AT Plastics is
    not a discontinued operation due to the level of continuing cash
    flows between the Films business and our AT Plastics’
    Polymers business subsequent to the sale. Under the terms of the
    purchase agreement, we entered into a two year sales agreement
    to continue selling product to BPI through August 2009.

Acquisition
    of Acetate Products Limited

On January 31, 2007, we completed the acquisition of the
    cellulose acetate flake, tow and film business of Acetate
    Products Limited (“APL”), a subsidiary of Corsadi B.V.
    The purchase price for the transaction was approximately
    £57 million ($112 million), in addition to direct
    acquisition costs of approximately £4 million
    ($7 million). As contemplated prior to the closing of the
    acquisition, we closed our tow production plant at Little Heath,
    United Kingdom during 2007.

Relocation
    of Ticona Plant in Kelsterbach

On November 29, 2006, we reached a settlement with the
    Frankfurt, Germany, Airport (“Fraport”) to relocate
    our Kelsterbach, Germany, business, resolving several years of
    legal disputes related to the planned Frankfurt airport
    expansion. The final settlement agreement was approved by the
    Fraport supervisory board on May 8, 2007 at an
    extraordinary board meeting. The final settlement agreement was
    signed on June 12, 2007. As a result of the settlement, we
    will transition Ticona’s operations from Kelsterbach to
    another location in Germany by mid-2011. In July 2007, we
    announced that we would relocate the Kelsterbach, Germany,
    business to the Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine Main area.
    Over a five-year period, Fraport will pay Ticona a total of
    €670 million to offset the costs associated with the
    transition of the business from its current location and the
    closure of the Kelsterbach plant. The payment amount was
    increased by €20 million to €670 million in
    consideration of our agreement to waive certain obligations of
    Fraport set forth in the settlement agreement. These obligations
    related to the hiring of Ticona employees in the event the
    Ticona Plant relocated out of the Rhine Main area.

Below is a summary of the cash flow activity and financial
    statement impact associated with the Ticona plant relocation:

Expansion
    in China

The acetic acid facility located in our Nanjing, China complex
    has been running at full production rates since June 2007 and we
    commenced production of vinyl acetate emulsions at the complex
    during the fourth quarter of 2007. Operations for five other
    plants at the complex are expected to begin by 2009.

The complex brings world-class scale to one site for the
    production of acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer
    (“VAM”), acetic anhydride, emulsions,
    Celstran

®

long fiber-reinforced thermoplastic and UHMW-PE
    (“GUR”), an


ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. We believe the Nanjing
    complex will further enhance our capabilities to better meet the
    growing needs of our customers in a number of industries across
    Asia.

Clear
    Lake, Texas Outage

In May 2007, we announced that we had an unplanned outage at our
    Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid facility. At that time, we
    originally expected the outage to last until the end of May.
    Upon restart of the facility, additional operating issues were
    identified which necessitated an extension of the outage for
    further, more extensive repairs. In July 2007, we announced that
    the further repairs were unsuccessful on restart of the unit.
    All repairs were completed in early August 2007 and normal
    production capacity resumed. During the fourth quarter of 2007,
    we recorded approximately $40 million of insurance
    recoveries from our reinsurers in partial satisfaction of claims
    that we made based on losses resulting from the outage.

Asset
    Sales

On July 31, 2007, we reached an agreement with
    Babcock & Brown, a worldwide investment firm, which
    specializes in real estate and utilities development, to sell
    our Pampa, Texas, facility. We will maintain our chemical
    operations at the site until at least 2009. Proceeds received
    upon certain milestone events are treated as deferred proceeds
    and included in long-term Other liabilities until the
    transaction is complete, as defined in the sales agreement.

In December 2007, we sold the assets at our Edmonton, Alberta,
    Canada facility to a real estate developer for approximately
    $35 million. As part of the agreement, we will retain
    certain environmental liabilities associated with the site. We
    derecognized approximately $16 million of asset retirement
    obligations which were transferred to the buyer. As a result of
    the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $37 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Realignment
    of Business Segments

During 2007, we revised our reportable segments to reflect a
    change in how the Company is managed. This change was made to
    drive strategic growth and to group businesses with similar
    dynamics and growth opportunities. We also changed our internal
    transfer pricing methodology to generally reflect market-based
    pricing which we believe will make our results more comparable
    to our peer companies. The revised segments are Advanced
    Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial
    Specialties, Acetyl Intermediates and Other Activities. We have
    restated our reportable segments for all prior periods presented
    to conform to the year ended December 31, 2007
    presentation. For further detail on the business segments, see
    the “Summary by Business Segment” section below.

Summary
    of Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31,
    2007 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006

Net
    Sales

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net sales increased
    by 12% to $6,444 million compared to the same period in
    2006 as increases in pricing and favorable currency impacts more
    than offset lower overall volumes. Overall pricing increased 6%
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily driven by a
    tight global supply of acetyl, PVOH and emulsion products, and
    higher acetate tow and flake prices. Overall volumes decreased
    2% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the
    same period in 2006. Strong volume increases due to increased
    market penetration from several of Advanced Engineered
    Material’s key products and the successful startup of our
    acetic acid unit in Nanjing, China helped to partially offset
    the decreases in volumes in our Acetyl Intermediates and
    Industrial Specialties segments resulting from the temporary
    unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake,
    Texas facility. Favorable currency impacts of 4% (particularly
    related to the Euro) for the year ended December 31, 2007
    also contributed to the increases in net sales. In addition, the
    acquisition of APL in 2007 increased net sales by
    $227 million.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained relatively
    flat for the year ended December 31, 2007 (22.4%) compared
    to the same period in 2006 (22.7%). The slight decrease was
    primarily due to lower overall volumes and higher energy and raw
    material costs more than offsetting the higher overall prices
    and favorable currency impacts (particularly related to the
    Euro).

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by
    $20 million to $516 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The
    decrease was primarily due to the absence of executive severance
    and legal costs associated with the Squeeze-Out of
    $23 million and long-term incentive plan expenses of
    $20 million, both recorded in 2006. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses also decreased $5 million due to
    lower stock -based compensation expenses during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The
    decreases were partially offset by $15 million of
    additional expenses related to finance improvement initiatives
    and $6 million related to the revised deferred compensation
    plan expenses.

    statements).

Other (charges) gains, net for employee termination benefits and
    plant/office closures include charges related to our plan to
    simplify and optimize our Emulsions and PVOH businesses to
    become a leader in technology and innovation and grow in both
    new and existing markets. Other (charges) gains, net for
    employee termination benefits and plant/office closures as also
    includes charges related to the sale of our Pampa, Texas,
    facility. In addition, we recorded an impairment of long-lived
    assets of approximately $3 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

In May 2007, as a result of the triggering of an Exit Event, as
    defined in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
    statements, we expensed approximately $74 million
    representing deferred compensation plan payments for the
    respective participants’ 2005 and 2006 contingent benefits.

Operating
    Profit

Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2007
    increased 21% to $748 million compared to $620 million
    for the same period in 2006 as higher raw material costs and an
    increase in Other (charges) gains, net were more than offset by
    increases in net sales and proceeds received from an insurance
    recovery and a one time payment received. During the fourth
    quarter of 2007, we recorded insurance recoveries of
    approximately $40 million from a group of reinsurers in
    partial satisfaction of claims that we made based on losses
    resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid
    unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. In addition, during the
    fourth quarter of 2007, we received $31 million as a one
    time payment in resolution of commercial disputes with a vendor.
    Also included in operating profit for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 is a $34 million gain related to the
    sale of the our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada facility.

Equity
    in Net Earnings of Affiliates

Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 8% in the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period last
    year due primarily to improved performance from our Infraserv
    affiliates.

Interest
    Expense and Refinancing Expenses

Interest expense decreased $31 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The
    decrease was primarily related to lower interest rates on the
    new senior credit agreement compared to the interest rates on
    the senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes, which
    were repaid in April 2007 in


conjunction with the debt refinancing (see Note 15 to the
    consolidated financial statements for more information). These
    decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest
    expense due to additional China financing activities in 2007.

In April 2007, we refinanced our outstanding debt by entering
    into a new senior credit agreement. As a result of the
    refinancing, we expensed $207 million of premiums paid on
    early redemption of debt. In addition, we expensed
    $33 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and
    premiums related to the former $2,454 million senior credit
    facility, senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes
    and $16 million of debt issuance and other refinancing
    expenses. These amounts were recorded as a component of
    Refinancing expenses in the consolidated statement of operations
    for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense decreased by $93 million to
    $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was 25%, which is less than the combined
    US federal and state statutory rate of 39%. The effective
    tax rate for 2007 was favorably impacted by (1) an increase
    in unrepatriated low-taxed earnings including tax holidays and
    (2) the tax benefit related to German Tax Reform of
    $39 million recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. These benefits are partially offset by
    the accounting treatment of recent tax law changes in Mexico.
    See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

Earnings
    (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

Earnings from discontinued operations primarily relate to Acetyl
    Intermediates’ sale of its oxo products and derivatives
    businesses in February 2007, its shut down of its Edmonton,
    Canada methanol operations during the second quarter of 2007 and
    its Pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations, which were
    discontinued during the third quarter of 2006. As a result,
    revenues and expenses related to these businesses and operations
    are reflected as a component of discontinued operations. See
    Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the
    summary table of the results of operations for the discontinued
    operations.

Summary
    of Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31,
    2006 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net
    Sales

For the year ended December 31, 2006, net sales increased
    by 10% to $5,778 million compared to the same period in
    2005. An increase in pricing of 4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 driven by continued strong demand for the
    majority of our products and higher raw material and energy
    costs contributed to the improvement in net sales. Also, an
    increase in overall volumes of 3% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, driven by our Advanced Engineered
    Materials and Consumer Specialties business segments,
    contributed to the increase in net sales. The volume increases
    are the results of increased market penetration from several of
    Advanced Engineered Materials’ key products, an improved
    business environment in Europe, continued growth in Asia and
    continued growth in new and existing applications from our
    Sunett

®

sweetener. Additionally, net sales from Acetex of
    $542 million contributed to the increase in net sales for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to
    $247 million of net sales from Acetex for the same period
    in 2005. The Acetex business was acquired in July 2005.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained relatively
    flat for the year ended December 31, 2006 (22.7%) compared
    to the same period in 2005 (22.9%). Overall higher raw material
    and energy costs were mostly offset by higher volumes and
    pricing. Volumes increased for such products as acetyls, acetyl
    derivative products, polyacetal products (“POM”),
    Vectra and GUR while overall pricing increased, driven by
    increases in acetyls and acetyl derivative products.


Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $24 million to $536 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. The
    increase consists of stock-based compensation expense of
    $20 million resulting from our adoption of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No
    123(R)”), and $14 million related to our long-term
    incentive plan. Additionally, the year ended December 31,
    2006 included additional selling, general and administrative
    expenses from the Acetex business, which was acquired in July
    2005, as well as costs related to executive severance and legal
    costs associated with the Squeeze-Out of CAG shareholders of
    $23 million. These expenses were mostly offset by ongoing
    cost savings initiatives from the Advanced Engineered Materials
    and Consumer Specialties segments and lower costs in 2006
    resulting from the divestiture of the Cyclo-olefine Copolymer
    business (“COC”) business, which occurred in 2005.

Other
    (Charges) Gains, Net

The components of Other (charges) gains, net for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

(10

)

(61

)

Other (charges) gains, net for the year ended December 31,
    2006 decreased $51 million compared to the same period in
    2005. The decrease was due to the absence of environmental
    related plant closures of $12 million, the absence of asset
    impairment charges of $25 million related to the
    divestiture of our COC business and the absence of
    $35 million related to the termination of advisor
    monitoring services, all of which were recorded in 2005. The
    decrease was partially offset by a reduction in insurance
    recoveries associated with plumbing cases of $29 million.

Operating
    Profit

Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2006
    increased 28% compared to the same period in 2005. This was
    principally driven by higher overall volumes and pricing, lower
    Other (charges) gains, net and productivity improvements. Also,
    the year ended December 31, 2006 included operating profit
    from Acetex of $5 million, an increase of $8 million
    compared to the same period in 2005.

Equity
    in Net Earnings of Affiliates

Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 49% in the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in
    2005. The increase was primarily due to additional income of
    $8 million from the Infraserv affiliates, $4 million
    from our Advanced Engineered Materials affiliates as well as the
    absence of a $10 million loss from Estech GmbH, recorded in
    2005.

Interest
    Expense and Refinancing Expenses

Interest expense remained relatively flat for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005.


Refinancing expenses decreased to $1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $102 million in the same
    period in 2005. The decrease was due to the absence of
    $28 million related to accelerated amortization of deferred
    financing costs and $74 million related to early redemption
    premiums associated with the partial redemption of the senior
    subordinated notes, senior discount notes and floating rate term
    loan, both recorded in 2005.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense increased by $179 million to
    $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    effective tax rate for 2006 was 39%, slightly higher than the
    combined US federal and state statutory rate of 37%. The
    effective tax rate was favorably impacted by unrepatriated
    low-taxed earnings, primarily in Singapore. The effective tax
    rate was unfavorably affected by (1) dividends and other
    passive income inclusions from foreign subsidiaries and equity
    investments, and (2) higher tax rates in certain foreign
    jurisdictions, primarily Germany. The effective rate reflects a
    partial benefit for the reversal of valuation allowance on
    earnings in the US of $5 million. Reversals of valuation
    allowance established at the original acquisition of CAG shares
    (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information) resulting from positive earnings or a
    change in judgment regarding the realizability of the net
    deferred tax asset are primarily reflected as a reduction of
    Goodwill, which amounted to $84 million in 2006.

Earnings
    (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

Earnings from discontinued operations primarily relate to Acetyl
    Intermediates’ sale of its oxo products and derivatives
    businesses in February 2007, its shut down of its Edmonton,
    Canada methanol operations during the second quarter of 2007 and
    its PE operations, which were discontinued during the third
    quarter of 2006. As a result, revenues and expenses related to
    these businesses and operations are reflected as a component of
    discontinued operations.

Our Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical
    polymers for application in automotive and electronics products
    and in other consumer and industrial applications, often
    replacing metal or glass. The primary products of Advanced
    Engineered Materials are POM and GUR. POM is used in a broad
    range of products including automotive components, electronics
    and appliances. GUR is used in battery separators, conveyor
    belts, filtration equipment, coatings and medical devices.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ net sales increased 13% to
    $1,030 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to volume
    growth in all major business lines and favorable currency
    impacts of 5% (primarily related to the Euro) partially offset
    by a slight decline in pricing. Overall volume for the year
    increased 9% principally driven by increased market penetration,
    successful implementation of new projects and a continued strong
    business environment, particularly in Europe. Advanced
    Engineered Materials experienced a slight decline in average
    pricing primarily driven by a larger mix of sales from lower
    priced products.

Operating profit decreased to $133 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to $145 million for
    the same period in 2006 as higher volumes and favorable currency
    impacts (particularly related to the Euro) were more than offset
    by higher energy costs, increased Other (charges) gains, net and
    slightly lower average pricing. Other (charges) gains, net
    increased primarily due to $2 million of deferred
    compensation plan expenses and $5 million of Kelsterbach
    plant relocation costs, both incurred in 2007.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests decreased 6% to $189 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006
    primarily due to lower operating profits in 2007 driven by
    increased Other (charges) gains, net as discussed above.

Our Consumer Specialties segment consists of our Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. Our Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow, which is used in
    the production of filter products. We also produce acetate flake
    which is processed into acetate fiber in the form of a tow band.
    The successful completion of the acquisition of APL on
    January 31, 2007 further increases our global position and
    enhances our ability to serve our customers. Our Nutrinova
    business produces and sells
    Sunett

®

,
    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceuticals
    industries.

Consumer Specialties’ net sales increased 27% to
    $1,111 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006 primarily driven by
    additional net sales from the APL acquisition completed on
    January 31, 2007. Net sales for APL were $227 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2007. Higher pricing for
    acetate tow and flake products, higher
    Sunett

®

sweetener volumes and favorable currency impacts (particularly
    related to the Euro) for the Nutrinova business also contributed
    to the overall increase in net sales. Higher
    Sunett

®

sweetener volumes reflected the continued growth in the global
    beverage and confectionary markets. These increases were
    partially offset by lower acetate flake volumes and
    Nutrinova’s exit of non-core lower margin trade business
    during the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in acetate flake
    volumes was due primarily to the shift in production of acetate
    flake to our China ventures.

Operating profit increased $34 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006.
    Higher overall pricing more than offset increases in raw
    material costs. Higher overall costs were primarily due to price
    increases in wood pulp, acetyls (used as raw materials in
    acetate flake production) and acetate flake as well as expenses
    associated with the continued integration of APL. Other
    (charges) gains, net during the year ended December 31,
    2007 includes $3 million of deferred compensation plan
    expenses, $5 million of other restructuring charges and
    insurance recoveries from a group of reinsurers of approximately
    $5 million for partial satisfaction of the losses resulting
    from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at
    our Clear Lake, Texas facility. Also included in operating
    profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 is a
    $22 million gain related to the sale of the our Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased $50 million to $235 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. The increase was driven principally by the
    changes in operating profit discussed above and an increase of
    $16 million in dividends received from our China ventures
    during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the
    same period in 2006.

Depreciation and amortization increased $12 million to
    $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006 primarily driven by the
    acquisition of APL in 2007.

Our Industrial Specialties segment includes our Emulsions, PVOH
    and AT Plastics businesses. Our Emulsions business is a global
    leader which produces a broad product portfolio, specializing in
    vinyl acetate/ethylene emulsions and is the recognized authority
    on low VOC (volatile organic compounds), an
    environmentally-friendly technology. Also a global leader, our
    PVOH business produces and sells a broad portfolio of
    performance PVOH chemicals engineered to meet specific customer
    requirements. Our emulsions and PVOH products are used in a wide
    array of applications including paints and coatings, adhesives,
    building and construction, glass fiber, textiles and paper. AT
    Plastics offers a complete line of low-density polyethylene and
    specialty, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers. AT Plastics’
    products are used in many applications including flexible
    packaging films, lamination film products, hot melt adhesives,
    medical tubing and automotive carpeting.

Industrial Specialties’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 increased 5% to $1,346 million
    compared to the same period in 2006 primarily driven by pricing
    increases and favorable currency impacts (particularly related
    to the Euro) of 5% partially offset by a slight decrease in
    volumes. Higher overall pricing, particularly in our emulsions
    and PVOH products, was primarily due to market tightness and
    increasing raw materials costs which allowed for upward movement
    in pricing across all regions. Lower volumes were primarily
    driven by the tight supply of VAM, a major raw material used in
    the production of emulsions products. This was a result of the
    temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our Clear
    Lake, Texas facility and other global planned and unplanned
    production outages in the chemical industry during the year
    ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was
    partially offset by the absence of net sales from the AT
    Plastics’ Films business, which was divested during the
    third quarter of 2007.

Operating profit decreased $16 million to $28 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. Higher prices and favorable currency impacts
    (particularly related to the Euro) were more than offset by the
    increase in Other (charges) gains, net. Other (charges) gains,
    net for the year ended December 31, 2007 included
    $14 million of employee termination benefits,
    $3 million for an impairment of long-lived assets and
    $5 million of accelerated depreciation expense for our
    Warrington plant. These increases were a result of our plan to
    simplify and optimize our Emulsions and PVOH businesses to
    become a leader in technology and innovation and grow in both
    new and existing markets. Other (charges) gains, net for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 also included approximately
    $6 million of goodwill impairment. The increase in Other
    (charges) gains, net was partially offset by insurance
    recoveries from a group of reinsurers of approximately
    $7 million for partial satisfaction of the losses resulting
    from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at
    our Clear Lake, Texas facility. Additionally, operating profit
    decreased by approximately $7 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as a result of the loss on the
    divestiture of our AT Plastics’ Films business.


Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests decreased $15 million to $28 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in
    2006 principally driven by lower operating profits.

Our Acetyl Intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl
    products, including acetic acid, VAM, acetic anhydride and
    acetate esters. These products are generally used as starting
    materials for colorants, paints, adhesives, coatings, medicines
    and more. Other chemicals produced in this segment are organic
    solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical, agricultural and
    chemical products.

Acetyl Intermediates’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 increased 8% to $3,615 million
    compared to the same period in 2006 driven by pricing increases
    and favorable currency impacts (particularly related to the
    Euro) of 4% partially offset by lower volumes. Tight supply of
    acetyl products caused by global planned and unplanned
    production outages in the industry and higher methanol and
    ethylene prices were the drivers of the price increases. Lower
    volumes in 2007 were the result of lower product availability
    due to the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at
    our Clear Lake, Texas facility. However, the decrease in volumes
    from the Clear Lake, Texas facility was partially offset by the
    successful startup of our acetic acid plant in Nanjing, China
    and externally procured product.

Operating profit increased to $616 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to $456 million in
    the same period in 2006. Higher pricing, favorable currency
    impacts (particularly related to Euro) and an improvement in
    Other (charges) gains, net were partially offset by higher raw
    material costs. Other (charges) gains, net for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 included $4 million of employee
    termination benefits and $5 million of expenses related to
    accelerated depreciation expense, both associated with the
    pending sale of our Pampa, Texas plant, and $10 million for
    deferred compensation plan expenses. These charges were more
    than offset by $31 million related to a one time payment
    received in resolution of commercial disputes with a vendor and
    insurance recoveries from a group of reinsurers of approximately
    $28 million for partial satisfaction of the losses
    resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid
    unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. Acetyl Intermediates
    also received $35 million of insurance recoveries from our
    captive insurance companies relating to the unplanned outage of
    the acetic acid unit at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. This
    amount is included in Acetyl Intermediates’ Other (charges)
    gains, net but is properly eliminated in our consolidated
    statement of operations. Operating profit also includes a gain
    on the sale of our Edmonton facility of $12 million.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased $175 million to $694 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006 primarily driven by higher operating profit and
    an increase in dividend income from our cost investments.
    Dividend income from our National Methanol


Company cost investment increased $24 million due to
    increased earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006.

Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities, and the
    captive insurance companies.

Net sales for Other Activities decreased to $2 million from
    $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was
    principally driven by the decrease in third-party revenues from
    our captive insurance companies.

Operating loss increased to $228 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to $190 million in the same
    period in 2006. This increase was principally driven by an
    increase in Other (charges) gains, net more than offsetting a
    decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Other
    (charges) gains, net increased primarily due to $59 million
    of deferred compensation plan costs expensed in 2007. Selling,
    general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 primarily due to the absence of executive
    severance and legal costs associated with the Squeeze-Out of
    $23 million and long-term incentive plan expenses of
    $20 million recorded in 2006.

Loss from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased $277 million to $699 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. The increase was primarily driven by the
    increase in operating loss discussed above and higher
    refinancing expenses incurred in 2007, partially offset by lower
    interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    we incurred $256 million of refinancing expenses associated
    with the April 2, 2007 debt refinancing. Interest expense
    decreased $31 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006
    primarily related to lower interest rates on the new senior
    credit agreement compared to the interest rates on the senior
    discount notes and senior subordinated notes, which were repaid
    in April 2007 in conjunction with the debt refinancing. In
    addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we
    incurred approximately $26 million of mark-to-market loss
    on the cross currency swap and the Euro denominated term loan
    that had been used as a hedge of our net investment in our
    European subsidiaries.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ net sales increased 3% to
    $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005. The increase for the year
    was primarily driven by 6% higher volumes. Volumes increased in
    all product lines due to increased market penetration and a
    stronger business environment in


Europe. Improved volumes during 2006 were partially offset by
    the absence of net sales from the COC business, which was
    divested in December 2005. During the year ended
    December 31, 2005, COC recorded approximately
    $19 million in net sales.

Operating profit increased to $145 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to $60 million for
    the same period in 2005 as improved net sales more than offset
    higher raw material and energy costs. Also contributing to the
    increases are positive effects from the exit of the COC business
    (including a reduction in Other (charges) gains, net due to the
    2005 asset impairment charge of $25 million), productivity
    improvements and lower spending due to an organizational
    redesign. During the year ended December 31, 2005, COC
    recorded an operating loss of $69 million, including asset
    impairments mentioned above.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 73% to $201 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. This
    increase is primarily due to the increases in operating profit.
    Equity in net earnings of affiliates increased $4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same
    period in 2005.

Consumer Specialties’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 increased 4% to $876 million
    compared to the same period in 2005 primarily driven by a 3%
    increase in pricing as higher overall pricing in the Acetate
    Products business more than offset the lower pricing for
    Sunett

®

sweetener products.
    Sunett

®

sweetener pricing declined on lower unit selling prices
    associated with higher volumes to Nutrinova’s major
    customers. Overall volumes for Consumer Specialties increased
    slightly driven by higher
    Sunett

®

volumes due to strong demand from Nutrinova’s customers
    associated with new product launches as well as the impact from
    the warmer than normal temperatures in Europe and North America
    in 2006. The increase in volumes was partially offset by lower
    acetate tow volumes in the Acetate Products business, which were
    a result of shutting down our Canadian tow plant, and lower
    sales to China, which was due to the expansion of our China tow
    ventures.

Operating profit increased to $165 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to $128 million in
    the same period in 2005. Higher overall pricing in the Acetate
    Products business, volume growth for
    Sunett

®

sweetener products and lower Other (charges) gains, net more
    than offset higher raw material costs, lower acetate tow volumes
    and lower
    Sunett

®

pricing. The lower Other (charges) gains, net was due primarily
    to the absence of $7 million of environmental related plant
    closure costs recorded in 2005.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased 46% to $185 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. The
    increase is primarily due to higher operating profits as well as
    an increase of $19 million in dividends from our China
    ventures received in 2006.

Industrial Specialties’ net sales for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 increased 21% to $1,281 million
    compared to the same period in 2005 primarily driven by higher
    pricing and inclusion of sales from the AT Plastics business.
    Net sales for AT Plastics increased to $235 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $112 million
    for the same period in 2005. The increase in AT Plastics net
    sales is primarily due to a full year of sales activity in 2006
    compared to five months of activity in 2005 as AT Plastics was
    acquired in July 2005. Overall pricing increased 3% driven by
    continued strong demands for the majority of our products and
    increasing raw material costs. Higher volumes and favorable
    currency impacts (particularly related to the Euro) also
    contributed to the overall increase in net sales.

Operating profit increased to $44 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to an operating loss of
    $4 million in the same period in 2005 as pricing increases
    and an increase in operating profit from the AT Plastics
    business more than offset raw material price increases.
    Operating profit from the AT Plastics business increased
    $17 million in 2006 compared to the same period in 2005
    primarily due to a full year of sales activity in 2006 compared
    to five months of activity in 2005.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests increased $47 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005
    primarily due to the increase in operating profit discussed
    above.

Acetyl Intermediates’ net sales increased 15% to
    $3,351 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005. Pricing increased for most
    products driven primarily by the acetyl business lines. Higher
    pricing was a result of continued strong demand for the majority
    of our products and higher raw material costs. Overall volumes
    increased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared
    to the same period in 2005 primarily due to increased demand in
    Asia. Net sales also increased due to $307 million of net
    sales from Acetex (excluding AT Plastics), which was acquired in
    July 2005, an increase of $172 million compared to the same
    period in 2005.

Operating profit decreased 6% to $456 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005
    as higher raw material costs and natural gas prices more than
    offset strong demands for our acetyl products and lower Other
    (charges) gains, net. The lower Other (charges) gains, net was
    due to the absence of $6 million of severance costs
    associated with the closure of the Edmonton Methanol plant and
    $5 million of environmental related plant closure costs,
    both recorded in 2005.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests decreased 6% to $519 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005
    primarily due to lower operating profits and lower dividend
    income from our cost investments.

Other
    Activities

Net sales for Other Activities decreased to $22 million
    from $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to the absence
    of $8 million of net sales resulting from the sale of PBI
    and Vectran product lines during the second quarter of 2005.

Operating loss increased to $190 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to a loss of $184 million
    in the same period in 2005. The operating loss increased during
    the year due to executive severance and legal costs of
    $23 million associated with the Squeeze-Out of CAG
    shareholders, stock-based compensation expense of
    $20 million resulting from our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) and $14 million related to our
    long-term incentive plan. The increase was partially offset by
    the absence of $45 million of Other (charges) gains, net
    related to the 2005 advisor monitoring fee and the termination
    of advisor monitoring services agreement during the first
    quarter of 2005.

Loss from continuing operations before tax and minority
    interests improved to a loss of $422 million from a loss of
    $518 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to a decrease
    in refinancing expenses of $101 million. Lower refinancing
    expenses are due to the absence of $28 million related to
    accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and
    $74 million related to early redemption


premiums associated with the partial redemption of the senior
    subordinated notes, senior discount notes and floating rate term
    loan, both recorded in 2005.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from
    operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends
    from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, we
    have availability under our senior credit agreement to assist,
    if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other
    contractual obligations. We believe we will have available
    resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt
    service, for the remainder of 2008. If our cash flow from
    operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other
    obligations, we may be required to use other means available to
    us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying
    capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to
    restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no
    assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows
    at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain
    our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities.

Cash
    Flows

Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2007 were
    $825 million, which was an increase of $34 million
    from December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents as of
    December 31, 2006 were $791 million, which was an
    increase of $401 million from December 31, 2005. See
    below for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents
    from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 and the
    change in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2005
    to December 31, 2006.

Net
    Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased to a cash
    inflow of $566 million in 2007 compared to a cash inflow of
    $751 million for the same period in 2006. The decrease in
    operating cash flows was primarily due to adjustments to cash
    for discontinued operations and an increase in working capital,
    partially offset by an increase in earnings from continuing
    operations. Adjustments to cash for discontinued operations of
    $84 million relates primarily to working capital changes of
    the oxo products and derivatives businesses and the shut down of
    our Edmonton, Canada methanol facility during 2007. Earnings
    from continuing operations increased to $336 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with
    $319 million for the same period in 2006.

Cash provided by operating activities was $751 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with
    $701 million for the same period in 2005. The increase in
    operating cash flows was due primarily to an increase in
    earnings from continuing operations partially offset by an
    increase in cash used from changes in operating assets and
    liabilities. Earnings from continuing operations increased to
    $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared with $214 million for the same period in 2005. The
    changes in operating assets and liabilities were driven
    primarily by higher trade and other receivables offset by higher
    trade payables. The increase in receivables is due to higher net
    sales. The increase in trade payables is due to the timing of
    payments.

Net
    Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities

Net cash from investing activities improved to a cash inflow of
    $143 million in 2007 compared to a cash outflow of
    $268 million in 2006. The increase in cash inflow was
    primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our oxo products
    and derivatives businesses partially offset by the cash outflow
    for the APL acquisition. Additionally, our cash outflow for
    capital expenditures during the year ended December 31,
    2007 was $44 million higher compared to the same period in
    2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we increased
    restricted cash by $42 million related to the anticipated
    payment to minority shareholders for their remaining CAG shares.
    During the year ended December 31, 2007, as a result of the
    completion of the Squeeze-Out (see Note 2 to the
    consolidated financial statements) and the payment to minority
    shareholders for their remaining CAG shares, restricted cash
    decreased $46 million.

Net cash from investing activities improved to a cash outflow of
    $268 million in 2006 compared to a cash outflow of
    $907 million in 2005. The decrease in cash outflow is
    primarily due to cash paid of $473 million for the purchase
    of additional CAG shares in 2005, $216 million for the
    purchase of Acetex in July 2005 and $198 million


for the purchase of Vinamul in February 2005. These decreases
    were offset by the net effect of an increase in cash paid for
    capital expenditures of $41 million, an increase in
    restricted cash of $42 million, a decrease in net proceeds
    from the sale and purchase of marketable securities of
    $42 million, proceeds received for the Kelsterbach plant
    relocation of $26 million in 2006, the net effect of a
    decrease in investing cash used in discontinued operations of
    $105 million, a decrease in fees associated with the 2005
    acquisitions of $29 million and a decrease in the proceeds
    received from the sales of assets of $25 million.

Our cash outflow for capital expenditures were
    $288 million, $244 million and $203 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Capital expenditures were primarily related to
    major replacements of equipment, capacity expansions, major
    investments to reduce future operating costs and environmental,
    health and safety initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2007,
    2006 and 2005 included costs for the expansion of our Nanjing,
    China site into an integrated chemical complex. Cash outflows
    for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately
    $300 million in 2008.

Net
    Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash from financing activities increased to a cash outflow
    of $714 million in 2007 compared to a cash outflow of
    $108 million in the same period in 2006. The decrease
    primarily relates to the repurchase of shares of our
    Series A common stock and the debt refinancing as discussed
    in Notes 18 and 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by
    $69 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock
    options. Primarily as a result of the debt refinancing, we
    incurred a net cash outflow of $119 million related to
    repayments of our debt and approximately $240 million for
    various refinancing expenses during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Furthermore, we paid a total of
    $403 million to repurchase shares of our Series A
    common stock during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Net cash from financing activities decreased to a cash outflow
    of $108 million in 2006 compared to a cash outflow of
    $144 million in 2005. The cash outflow in 2006 primarily
    relates to the $100 million equivalent voluntary prepayment
    of our senior term loan facility on July 14, 2006 as well
    as increased dividends paid on our Series A common stock
    and our preferred stock of $15 million in 2006. We
    commenced making common and preferred cash dividends during the
    third quarter of 2005.

In addition, exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents
    increased to a favorable currency effect of $39 million in
    2007 from a favorable currency effect of $26 million in
    2006. Exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents
    increased to a favorable currency effect of $26 million in
    2006 from an unfavorable currency effect of $98 million in
    2005.

Liquidity

Our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service
    requirements over the next several years are significant. As
    stated above, our primary source of liquidity is cash generated
    from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and
    dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In
    addition, we have availability under our senior credit agreement
    to assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and
    other contractual obligations.

On a stand alone basis, we have no material assets other than
    the stock of our subsidiaries and no independent external
    operations of our own. As such, we generally will depend on the
    cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations under our
    preferred stock, our Series A common stock and our senior
    credit agreement.

Debt
    Refinancing

In March 2007, we announced a comprehensive recapitalization
    plan to refinance our debt and repurchase outstanding shares of
    our Series A common stock. On April 2, 2007, we,
    through certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a new senior
    credit agreement. The new senior credit agreement consists of
    $2,280 million of US dollar denominated and
    €400 million of Euro denominated term loans due 2014,
    a $650 million revolving credit facility terminating in
    2013 and a $228 million credit-linked revolving facility
    terminating in 2014. Borrowings under the new senior credit
    agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on
    LIBOR (for US dollars) or EURIBOR


(for Euros), as applicable, or, for US dollar denominated loans
    under certain circumstances, a base rate, in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term loans and
    any loans under the credit-linked revolving facility is 1.75%,
    subject to potential reductions as defined in the new senior
    credit agreement. The term loans under the new senior credit
    agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the initial
    principal amount per annum, payable quarterly commencing in July
    2007. The remaining principal amount of the term loans will be
    due on April 2, 2014.

Proceeds from the new senior credit agreement, together with
    available cash, were used to retire our $2,454 million
    amended and restated (January 2005) senior credit
    facilities, which consisted of $1,626 million in term loans
    due 2011, a $600 million revolving credit facility
    terminating in 2009 and an approximate $228 million
    credit-linked revolving facility terminating in 2009, and to
    retire all of our Senior Subordinated Notes and Senior Discount
    Notes as discussed below.

On March 6, 2007, we commenced cash tender offers (the
    “Tender Offers”) with respect to any and all of the
    outstanding 10% senior discount notes due 2014 and
    10.5% senior discount notes due 2014 (the “Senior
    Discount Notes”), and any and all of the outstanding
    9.625% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and
    10.375% senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the
    “Senior Subordinated Notes”). The Tender Offers
    expired on April 2, 2007. Substantially all of the Senior
    Discount Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes were tendered in
    conjunction with the Tender Offers. The remaining outstanding
    Senior Discount Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes not tendered
    in conjunction with the Tender Offers were redeemed in May 2007
    through optional redemption allowed in the indentures.

As a result of the refinancing, we incurred $207 million of
    premiums paid on early redemption of debt which is included in
    Refinancing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements
    of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. In
    addition, we expensed $33 million of unamortized deferred
    financing costs and premiums related to the former
    $2,454 million senior credit facility, Senior Discount
    Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes and $16 million of debt
    issuance and other refinancing expenses.

In connection with the refinancing, we recorded deferred
    financing costs of $39 million related to the new senior
    credit agreement, which are included in long-term Other assets
    on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2007 and are being amortized over the term of
    the new senior credit agreement. The deferred financing costs
    consist of $23 million of costs incurred to acquire the new
    senior credit agreement and $16 million of debt issue costs
    existing prior to the refinancing which were retained and are
    being amortized over the term of the new senior credit
    agreement. As a result of the refinancing, we incurred, for the
    period April 2007 to July 2007, approximately $26 million
    of mark-to-market loss on the cross currency swap and the Euro
    denominated term loan that had been used as a hedge of our net
    investment in our European subsidiaries. The loss is included in
    Other income (expense), net in the consolidated financial
    statements. We designated the net investment hedge as such
    during July 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, there were $129 million of
    letters of credit issued under the credit-linked revolving
    facility and $99 million remained available for borrowing.
    As of December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding
    borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
    credit facility; accordingly, $650 million remained
    available for borrowing.

As of December 31, 2007, we had total debt of
    $3,556 million and cash and cash equivalents of
    $825 million. As of December 31, 2007, net debt (total
    debt less cash and cash equivalents) increased to
    $2,731 million from $2,707 million as of
    December 31, 2006. Increases to net debt during the year
    ended December 31, 2007 included capital expenditures of
    $288 million, foreign currency impacts of $91 million,
    additional capital lease obligations of $76 million,
    purchases of treasury stock of $403 million, cash outflows
    of $240 million related to refinancing fees paid on the
    April 2, 2007 debt refinancing and cash outflows of
    $269 million for acquisitions and related fees completed in
    2007. These increases in net debt were partially offset by cash
    flows from operations of $566 million, proceeds received
    from the sale of businesses and assets of $715 million and
    proceeds received from stock option exercises of
    $69 million.


Commitments
    Relating to Share Capital

Holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as
    and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally
    available, cash dividends at the rate of 4.25% per annum (or
    $1.06 per share) of liquidation preference, payable quarterly in
    arrears commencing on May 1, 2005. Dividends on the
    preferred stock are cumulative from the date of initial
    issuance. As of December 31, 2007, the dividend is expected
    to result in an annual payment of approximately
    $10 million. Accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at
    an annual rate of 4.25%. The preferred stock is convertible, at
    the option of the holder, at any time into approximately
    1.25 shares of our Series A common stock, subject to
    adjustments, per $25.00 liquidation preference of the preferred
    stock. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, we paid $10 million, $10 million and
    $8 million, respectively, of cash dividends on our
    preferred stock. On January 4, 2008, we declared a
    $3 million cash dividend on our convertible perpetual
    preferred stock, which was paid on February 1, 2008.

In July 2005, our Board of Directors adopted a policy of
    declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash
    dividend on each share of our Series A common stock at an
    annual rate initially equal to approximately 1% of the $16.00
    initial public offering price per share of our Series A
    common stock (or $0.16 per share) unless our Board of Directors
    in its sole discretion determines otherwise. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid $25 million,
    $26 million and $13 million, respectively, in cash
    dividends on our Series A common stock. On January 4,
    2008, we declared a $6 million cash dividend which was paid
    on February 1, 2008. Based upon the number of outstanding
    shares as of December 31, 2007, the dividend is expected to
    result in an annual payment of approximately $24 million in
    2008. However, there is no assurance that sufficient cash or
    surplus will be available to pay the remainder of the
    anticipated 2008 cash dividend.

Unconditional Purchase
    Obligations.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations
    primarily include take or pay contracts. We do not expect to
    incur any material losses under these contractual arrangements.
    In addition, these contracts may include variable price
    components.

Other Contractual Obligations.

Other
    Contractual Obligations primarily includes committed capital
    spending and fines associated with the US antitrust settlement
    described in Note 24 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Also included in Other Contractual Obligations is a
    €99 million fine from the European Commission related
    to antitrust matters in the sorbates industry, which is pending
    an appeal. We are indemnified by a third party for 80% of the
    expenses relating to these matters, which is not reflected in
    the amount above.

As of December 31, 2007, we have contractual guarantees and
    commitments as follows:

We are secondarily liable under a lease agreement which we
    assigned to a third party. The lease expires on April 30,
    2012. The lease liability for the period from January 1,
    2008 to April 30, 2012 is estimated to be approximately
    $34 million.

Standby letters of credit of $129 million outstanding as of
    December 31, 2007 are irrevocable obligations of an issuing
    bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that
    certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with
    specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that
    material payments will be required under these agreements. The
    stand-by letters of credit include approximately
    $33 million related to obligations associated with the
    sorbates antitrust matters as described in the “Other
    Contractual Obligations” above.

Deferred Compensation.

In May 2007, the
    Original Shareholders sold their remaining equity interest in
    our Company (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information) triggering an Exit Event,
    as defined in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Cash compensation of approximately $74 million,
    representing the participants’ 2005 and 2006 contingent
    benefits, was paid to the participants during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. See Note 21 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

On April 2, 2007, certain participants in our deferred
    compensation plan elected to participate in a revised program,
    which includes both cash awards and restricted stock units.
    Under the revised program, participants relinquished their cash
    awards of up to $30 million that would have contingently
    accrued from

2007-2009

under the original plan. See additional discussion of the
    revised program in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
    statements. Based on current participation in the revised
    program, the awards, which will be expensed between
    April 2, 2007 and December 31, 2010, aggregate to
    approximately $27 million plus notional earnings. We
    expensed approximately $6 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 related to the revised program.

In December 2007, we adopted a deferred compensation plan
    whereby we offered certain of our senior employees and directors
    the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation in
    exchange for a future payment amount equal to their deferments
    plus or minus certain amounts based upon the market-performance
    of specified measurement funds selected by the participant.
    Participants were required to make deferral elections under the
    plan in December 2007, and such deferrals will be withheld from
    their compensation during the year ending December 31,
    2008. This plan became effective January 1, 2008.

Long-Term Incentive Plan.

On February 16,
    2007, approximately $26 million was paid to the long-term
    incentive plan (“LTIP”) plan participants. There are
    no additional amounts due under the LTIP plan. See Note 21
    to the consolidated financial statements for additional
    information.


Purchases of Treasury Stock.

In conjunction
    with the debt refinancing discussed above, we, through our
    wholly-owned subsidiary Celanese International Holdings
    Luxembourg S.à r.l. (“CIH”), repurchased
    2,021,775 shares of our outstanding Series A common
    stock in a modified “Dutch Auction” tender offer from
    public shareholders, which expired on April 3, 2007, at a
    purchase price of $30.50 per share. The total price paid for
    these shares was approximately $62 million. The number of
    shares purchased in the tender offer represented approximately
    1.3% of our outstanding Series A common stock at that time.
    We also separately purchased, through our wholly-owned
    subsidiary CIH, 329,011 shares of our Series A common
    stock at $30.50 per share from the investment funds associated
    with The Blackstone Group L.P. The total price paid for these
    shares was approximately $10 million. The number of shares
    purchased from Blackstone represented approximately 0.2% of our
    outstanding Series A common stock at that time.

Additionally, on June 4, 2007, our Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $330 million of our
    Series A common stock. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we repurchased 8,487,700 shares of
    our Series A common stock at an average purchase price of
    $38.88 per share for a total of approximately $330 million
    pursuant to this authorization. We completed repurchasing shares
    under this authorization during July 2007.

These purchases reduced the number of shares outstanding and the
    repurchased shares may be used by us for compensation programs
    utilizing our stock and other corporate purposes. We account for
    treasury stock using the cost method and include treasury stock
    as a component of Shareholders’ equity.

On February 8, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $400 million of our Series A common
    stock. The authorization gives management discretion in
    determining the conditions under which shares may be
    repurchased. As of February 29, 2008, we have repurchased
    64,400 shares of our Series A common stock at an average
    purchase price of $39.86 per share for a total of approximately
    $3 million in connection with this authorization.

Domination Agreement.

The domination and
    profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination
    Agreement”) was approved at the CAG extraordinary
    shareholders’ meeting on July 31, 2004. The Domination
    Agreement between CAG and the Purchaser became effective on
    October 1, 2004 and cannot be terminated by the Purchaser
    in the ordinary course of business until September 30,
    2009. Our subsidiaries, CIH, formerly Celanese Caylux Holdings
    Luxembourg S.C.A., and Celanese US, have each agreed to provide
    the Purchaser with financing to strengthen the Purchaser’s
    ability to fulfill its obligations under, or in connection with,
    the Domination Agreement and to ensure that the Purchaser will
    perform all of its obligations under, or in connection with, the
    Domination Agreement when such obligations become due,
    including, without limitation, the obligation to compensate CAG
    for any statutory annual loss incurred by CAG during the term of
    the Domination Agreement. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under such guarantees
    or other security to the Purchaser, we may not have sufficient
    funds for payments on our indebtedness when due. We have not had
    to compensate CAG for an annual loss for any period during which
    the Domination Agreement has been in effect.

Squeeze-Out Payment.

The Squeeze-Out was
    registered in the commercial register in Germany on
    December 22, 2006, after several lawsuits by minority
    shareholders challenging the shareholders’ resolution
    approving the Squeeze-Out were withdrawn pursuant to a
    settlement agreement entered into between plaintiff
    shareholders, the Purchaser and CAG on the same day. An
    aggregate purchase price of approximately €62 million
    was paid to minority shareholders in January 2007 as fair cash
    compensation for the acquisition of their shares in CAG,
    excluding direct acquisition costs of approximately
    €2 million. See Note 5 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

Pension and Other Postretirement
    Obligations.

Our contributions  for pension and
    postretirement benefits are expected to be $40 million and
    $34 million, respectively, in 2008.

Other
    Matters

Plumbing
    Actions and Sorbates Litigation

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims
    incidental to the normal conduct of our business. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, there were $23 million of
    cash inflows in connection with the plumbing actions and
    sorbates litigation. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    there were $14 million of cash inflows in


connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation. In
    February 2005, we settled with an insurance carrier and received
    cash proceeds of $44 million in March 2005 and in December
    2005, we received $30 million in additional settlements. As
    of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were reserves of
    $235 million and $214 million, respectively, for these
    matters. In addition, we have receivables from insurance
    companies and Hoechst, or its legal successors, in connection
    with the plumbing and sorbates matters of $137 million and
    $141 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Although it is impossible at this time to determine with
    certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters, we believe,
    based on the advice of legal counsel, that adequate provisions
    have been made and that the ultimate outcome will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, but could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
    cash flows in any given accounting period. See Note 24 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any material off-balance sheet
    arrangements.

Market
    Risks

Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about
    Market Risk” under Item 7A of this

Form 10-K

for additional information about our Market Risks.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection
    and application of significant accounting policies. The
    preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
    the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated charges
    during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any
    reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in
    materially different results.

We believe the following accounting polices and estimates are
    critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present
    in the current economic environment. These matters, and the
    judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential
    to understanding our reported and future operating results. See
    Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a more
    comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies.

Recoverability
    of Long-Lived Assets

Our business is capital intensive and has required, and will
    continue to require, significant investments in property, plant
    and equipment. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    carrying amount of property, plant and equipment was
    $2,362 million and $2,155 million, respectively.
    Whenever events or circumstances change, we assess the
    recoverability of property, plant and equipment to be held and
    used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group
    of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to
    be generated by the asset or group of assets. If such assets are
    considered impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as
    the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds
    the fair value of the assets.

We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least
    annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of goodwill or the indefinite-lived
    intangible asset may not be fully recoverable. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had $1,291 million and
    $1,338 million, respectively, of goodwill and other
    intangible assets, net.

As of December 31, 2007, there were no other significant
    changes in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances
    that led us to believe goodwill might have been impaired. We
    will continue to evaluate the need for impairment if changes in
    circumstances or available information indicate that impairment
    may have occurred. We perform the required impairment test at
    least annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using
    June 30 balances unless circumstances dictate more frequent
    testing.


A prolonged general economic downturn and, specifically, a
    continued downturn in the chemical industry as well as other
    market factors could intensify competitive pricing pressure,
    create an imbalance of industry supply and demand, or otherwise
    diminish volumes or profits. Such events, combined with changes
    in interest rates, could adversely affect our estimates of
    future net cash flows to be generated by our long-lived assets.
    Consequently, it is possible that our future operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected by additional
    impairment charges related to the recoverability of our
    long-lived assets.

Other
    (Charges) Gains, Net

Other (charges) gains, net include provisions for restructuring
    and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal
    ongoing course of operations. Restructuring provisions represent
    costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to
    major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign our
    operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a
    decision to exit non-strategic businesses. These measures are
    based on formal management decisions, establishment of
    agreements with the employees’ representatives or
    individual agreements with the affected employees as well as the
    public announcement of the restructuring plan. The related
    reserves reflect certain estimates, including those pertaining
    to separation costs, settlements of contractual obligations and
    other closure costs. We reassess the reserve requirements to
    complete each individual plan under our restructuring program at
    the end of each reporting period. Actual experience has been and
    may continue to be different from these estimates. See
    Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

Environmental
    Liabilities

We recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to
    environmental matters if available information indicates that it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss is reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the
    site, we accrue through fifteen years, unless we have government
    orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years. If
    the event of loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable,
    but is reasonably possible, we provide appropriate disclosure in
    the notes to the consolidated financial statements if the
    contingency is considered material. We estimate environmental
    liabilities on a

case-by-case

basis using the most current status of available facts, existing
    technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior
    experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of
    environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets
    when their receipt is deemed probable. See also Note 17 to
    the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

requires that the fair value of a liability for
    an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
    which it is incurred and FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 143

provides guidelines as to when a company is
    required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation.
    The liability is measured at the discounted fair value and is
    adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion
    expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs
    are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related
    long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining
    useful life. We have identified but not recognized asset
    retirement obligations related to certain of our existing
    operating facilities. Examples of these types of obligations
    include demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration
    activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the
    retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or
    abandonment of the existing operations. However, operations at
    these facilities are expected to continue indefinitely and
    therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be
    determined at this time. We will continue to assess strategies
    that may differ from past business decisions regarding the
    continuing operation of existing facilities. Asset retirement
    obligations will be recorded if these strategies are changed and
    probabilities of closure are assigned to existing facilities. If
    certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset
    retirement obligations could significantly affect our results of
    operations and cash flows.

Realization
    of Deferred Tax Assets

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable
    income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the


reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation
    allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
    portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
    Such evaluations require significant management judgments.
    Valuation allowances have been established primarily on net
    operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in
    the US and Canada. See Note 20 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

Tax
    Contingencies

We record accruals for taxes and associated interest that may
    become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax
    authorities. Prior to 2007, we accrued for tax contingencies
    when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority had
    been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be
    reasonably estimated.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income
    taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax
    benefit is required to meet before being recognized in the
    financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition.

Under FIN 48, tax benefits are recognized only when it is
    more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on
    technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon
    examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
    threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as
    the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax
    position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts
    and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all
    available evidence. See Note 20 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

Benefit
    Obligations

We have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering
    substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements.
    With respect to its US qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    minimum funding requirements are determined by the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act. Contributions to the various
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans are further
    discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financials
    statements. Benefits are generally based on years of service

and/or

compensation. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of
    the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These
    assumptions include the weighted average discount rate, rates of
    increase in compensation levels, expected long-term rates of
    return on plan assets and increases or trends in health care
    costs. In addition to the above mentioned assumptions, actuarial
    consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and
    mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation.
    The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual
    results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher
    or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of
    participants. These differences may result in a significant
    impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future
    periods.

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements
    related to pension and other postretirement benefits are
    determined on an actuarial basis. A significant assumption used
    in determining our pension expense is the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets of 8.5% for the US qualified defined benefit pension
    plan, which represents greater than 83% and 75% of pension plan
    assets and liabilities, respectively. On average, the actual
    return on plan assets over the long-term (15 to 20 years)
    has exceeded 9.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the US qualified defined benefit pension plan assets actual
    return was 100 basis points more than the expected
    long-term rate of return of plan assets. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the actual return was 630 basis
    points more than the expected long-term rate of return of plan
    assets. Based on our investment strategy, we believe that 8.5%
    is a reasonable long-term rate of return.

We estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected
    long-term rate of return for the US qualified defined benefit
    pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated
    $6 million in 2007. Another estimate that affects our
    pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount
    rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and
    other postretirement benefit plan obligations. At the end of
    each year, we determine the appropriate discount rate, used to
    determine the present value of future cash flows currently
    expected to be required to settle the


pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The
    discount rate is generally based on the yield on

high-quality

corporate fixed-income securities. As of December 31, 2007,
    we increased the discount rate to 6.30% from 5.88% as of
    December 31, 2006 for the US plans. We estimate that a
    50 basis point decline in our discount rate will decrease
    our annual pension expenses by an estimated $1 million, and
    increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $150 million for our US pension plan. In addition, the same
    basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase our
    annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than
    $1 million and $9 million respectively, for our US
    postretirement medical plans. We estimate that a 50 basis
    point decline in the discount rate for the non-US pension and
    postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other
    postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated
    $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and
    will increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $36 million and $2 million, respectively.

Other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life
    insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service
    requirements. The postretirement benefit cost for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 includes
    $18 million, $21 million and $25 million,
    respectively. The accrued post-retirement liability was
    $306 million and $343 million as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in long-term Other
    liabilities. The key determinants of the accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) are the
    discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate. The healthcare
    cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts
    of APBO and related expense. For example, increasing or
    decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage
    point in each year would result in the APBO as of
    December 31, 2007, and the 2007 postretirement benefit cost
    to change by approximately $4 million and $1 million,
    respectively. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

Accounting
    for Commitments and Contingencies

We are subject to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits,
    claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of
    our business, relating to and including product liability,
    patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices, release of chemicals
    into the environment and employment matters, which are handled
    and defended in the ordinary course of business. We routinely
    assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
    these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably
    estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by
    us after considering a broad range of information including:
    notifications, demands, settlements which have been received
    from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates
    performed by independent consultants and outside counsel,
    available facts, identification of other potentially responsible
    parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior
    experience. A determination of the amount of loss contingency
    required, if any, is assessed in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5,

Contingencies and Commitments,

and
    recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of
    each individual matter. The required reserves may change in the
    future due to new developments in each matter and as additional
    information becomes available. See Note 24 to the
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the
    outstanding commitments and contingencies and the related impact
    on our financial position and results of operations.

Business
    Combinations

Upon closing an acquisition, we estimate the fair values of
    assets and liabilities acquired as soon as practicable. Given
    the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize
    the acquired company’s balance sheet (frequently with
    implications for the purchase price of the acquisition), then to
    adjust the acquired company’s accounting policies,
    procedures, books and records to our standards, it is often
    several quarters before we are able to finalize those initial
    fair value estimates. Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the
    initial estimates to be subsequently revised within twelve
    months of an acquisition. The judgments made in determining the
    estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially
    impact our results of operations. See Note 5 to the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Captive
    Insurance Companies

We have two wholly owned insurance companies (the
    “Captives”) that are used as a form of self insurance
    for property, liability and workers compensation risks. One of
    the Captives also insures certain third-party risks. The
    liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated
    risk of loss which is based on our estimates and actuarial


valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the portion
    of the third-party premiums written applicable to the unexpired
    terms of the policies in-force. Liabilities are recognized for
    known claims when sufficient information has been developed to
    indicate involvement of a specific policy and we can reasonably
    estimate its liability. In addition, liabilities have been
    established to cover additional exposure on both known and
    unasserted claims. Estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and
    updated regularly. It is possible that actual results could
    differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Premiums
    written are recognized as revenue based on the terms of the
    policies. Capitalization of the Captives is determined by
    regulatory guidelines.

The Captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their
    risk of loss. The reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the
    Captives from its obligation to policyholders. Failure of the
    reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to
    the Captives. The Captives evaluate the financial condition of
    its reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to
    minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
    insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed
    non-collectible.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
    Risks

We are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial
    operations. Our financial market risk consists principally of
    exposure to currency exchange rates, interest rates and
    commodity prices. Exchange rate and interest rate risks are
    managed with a variety of techniques, including use of
    derivatives. We have in place policies of hedging against
    changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
    prices as described below. Contracts to hedge exposures are
    primarily accounted for under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”) amended by
    SFAS No. 138,

Accounting for Certain Derivative
    Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities

and
    SFAS No. 148,

Amendment of Statement 133 on
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate
    risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of
    borrowing. To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our
    variable rate debt, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to
    convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate
    obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are designated
    as cash flow hedges.

As of December 31, 2006, we had an interest rate swap
    agreement in place with a notional value of $300 million.
    On March 29, 2007, in connection with the April 2,
    2007 debt refinancing, we terminated this interest rate swap
    agreement and recognized a gain of $2 million related to
    amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net.

In March 2007, in anticipation of the April 2, 2007 debt
    refinancing, we entered into various US dollar and Euro interest
    rate swap agreements, which became effective on April 2,
    2007, with notional amounts of $1.6 billion and
    €150 million, respectively. These swaps remained
    outstanding as of December 31, 2007. Effective
    January 2, 2008, the notional amount of the
    $1.6 billion US dollar swap will decrease by
    $400 million. On November 16, 2007, we entered into an
    additional US dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount
    of $400 million, which became effective on January 2,
    2008.

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    $2.3 billion, €525 million and
    CNY1.2 billion of variable rate debt, of which
    $1.6 billion and €150 million is hedged with
    interest rate swaps, which leaves us approximately
    $692 million, €375 million and
    CNY1.2 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest
    rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1% increase in interest rates
    would increase annual interest expense by approximately
    $14 million.

See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our interest rate risk management and the
    related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.


Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

The primary business objective of this hedging program is to
    maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign
    currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from
    exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are
    minimized. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and
    to conduct operations either within functional currencies or
    using the protection of hedge strategies. Accordingly, we enter
    into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our
    exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. From time to time we
    may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted
    earnings. Forward contracts that are hedging receivables and
    payables booked in a currency other than the functional currency
    of an entity are not designated as hedges under
    SFAS No. 133.

Additionally, a portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar,
    principally the Euro. Fluctuations in the value of these
    currencies against the US dollar, particularly the value of the
    Euro, can have a direct and material impact on the business and
    financial results. For example, a decline in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar results in a decline in the US dollar
    value of our sales and earnings denominated in Euros due to
    translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar would result in an opposite effect.

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
    a foreign operation, we entered into cross currency swaps with
    certain financial institutions in 2004. Under the terms of the
    cross currency swap arrangements, we pay approximately
    €13 million in interest and receive approximately
    $16 million in interest on June 15 and December 15 of each
    year. Upon maturity of the cross currency swap agreement in June
    2008, we will pay approximately €276 million and
    receive approximately $333 million. These cross currency
    swaps and our senior Euro term loan are designated as a hedge of
    a net investment in a foreign operation. We dedesignated the net
    investment hedge due to the debt refinancing in April 2007 and
    redesignated the cross currency swaps and new senior EURO term
    loan in July 2007. As a result, we recorded approximately
    $26 million of mark-to-market losses related to the cross
    currency swaps and the new senior Euro term loan during this
    period.

See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and
    the related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Commodity
    Risk Management

Inherent in our business is exposure to price changes for
    several commodities. We manage our exposure primarily through
    the use of long-term supply agreements and multi-year purchasing
    and sales agreements. In addition, our policy allows us to enter
    into forward, swap

and/or

option contracts to mitigate short-term fluctuations in market
    prices for certain raw materials and energy, principally natural
    gas. These contracts are typically settled through actual
    delivery of the physical commodity.

See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our commodity risk management and the
    related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Controls
    and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(b)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the second half of 2007, we continued to refine our new
    SAP consolidation system for our financial reporting, which was
    implemented during the second quarter of 2007. This
    implementation has involved various changes to internal
    processes and control procedures over financial reporting;
    however, the basic internal controls over financial reporting
    have not materially changed. At the time of the filing of our
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2007, there were no changes
    in our internal control over financial reporting that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the
    Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
    our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable
    assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are
    made in accordance with management authorization; and providing
    reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
    disposition of company assets that could have a material effect
    on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting is not intended to
    provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our
    consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2007. KPMG LLP has audited
    this assessment of our internal control over financial
    reporting; their report is included below.


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying report of management on internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Celanese Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Celanese Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 29,
    2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007.
    These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with US generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 29, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes

, during the year ended December 31,
    2007.

As discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

, during the year ended December 31, 2006.

As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

,
    during the year ended December 31, 2006.

    processing chemical raw materials, such as methanol, carbon

    other chemical-based products.

Basis

    Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The term
    “Celanese US” refers to the Company’s subsidiary,
    Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
    formerly known as BCP Crystal US Holdings Corp., a Delaware
    corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The term
    “Purchaser” refers to the Company’s subsidiary,
    Celanese Europe Holding GmbH & Co. KG, formerly known
    as BCP Crystal Acquisition GmbH & Co. KG, a German
    limited partnership, and not its subsidiaries, except where

The consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual
    Report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America (“US

    financial statements and other financial information included in
    this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified, have been
    presented to separately show the effects of discontinued
    operations.

2.

Acquisition
    of CAG

Pursuant to a voluntary tender offer commenced in February 2004,
    the Purchaser, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Celanese
    Corporation, on April 6, 2004, acquired approximately 84%
    of the ordinary shares of CAG, excluding treasury shares, for a
    purchase price of $1,693 million, including direct
    acquisition costs of $69 million (the
    “Acquisition”).

On August 24, 2005, the Company acquired 5.9 million,
    or approximately 12%, of the outstanding CAG shares from two
    shareholders for €302 million ($369 million). The
    Company also paid such shareholders €12 million
    ($15 million) in consideration for the settlement of
    certain claims and for such shareholders agreeing to, among
    other things, (1) accept the shareholders’ resolutions
    passed at the extraordinary general meeting of CAG held on July
    30 and 31, 2004 and the annual general meeting of CAG held on
    May 19 and 20, 2005, (2) acknowledge the legal
    effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer
    agreement (the “Domination Agreement”),
    (3) irrevocably withdraw and abandon all actions,
    applications and appeals each brought or joined in legal
    proceedings related to, among other things, challenging the
    effectiveness of the Domination Agreement and amount of fair
    cash compensation offered by the Purchaser in the mandatory
    offer required by Section 305(1) of the German Stock
    Corporation Act, (4) refrain from acquiring any CAG shares
    or any other investment in CAG, and (5) refrain from taking
    any future legal action with respect to shareholder resolutions
    or corporate actions of CAG. Upon the acquisition of the
    additional CAG shares during the second half of 2005, the assets
    and liabilities of CAG were adjusted in the consolidated
    financial statements to fair value for the additional percentage
    acquired.

On May 30, 2006, CAG’s shareholders approved a
    transfer to the Purchaser of all shares owned by minority
    shareholders against payment of cash compensation in the amount
    of €66.99 per share (the “Squeeze-Out”). The
    Squeeze-Out was registered in the commercial register in Germany
    on December 22, 2006, after several lawsuits by minority
    shareholders challenging the shareholders’ resolution
    approving the Squeeze-Out were withdrawn

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into between
    plaintiff shareholders, the Purchaser and CAG on the same day.
    An aggregate purchase price of approximately
    €62 million was paid to minority shareholders in
    January 2007 as fair cash compensation for the acquisition of
    their shares in CAG, excluding direct acquisition costs of
    approximately €2 million. As a result of this
    acquisition, the Company recorded an increase to Goodwill of
    approximately $5 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The amount of the fair cash compensation
    of €66.99 per share could increase based on the outcome of
    award proceedings pending in German courts. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s ownership percentage
    in CAG was 100%.

Domination
    Agreement

On October 1, 2004, a Domination Agreement between CAG and
    the Purchaser became operative. When the Domination Agreement
    became operative, the Purchaser became obligated to offer to
    acquire all outstanding CAG shares from the minority
    shareholders of CAG in return for payment of fair cash
    compensation. The amount of this fair cash compensation was
    determined to be €41.92 per share, plus interest, in
    accordance with applicable German law. Until the Squeeze-Out was
    registered in the commercial register in Germany on
    December 22, 2006, any minority shareholder who elected not
    to sell its shares to the Purchaser was entitled to remain a
    shareholder of CAG and to receive from the Purchaser a gross
    guaranteed annual payment on its shares of €3.27 per CAG
    share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any dividend. For
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, a charge
    of €0 million ($0 million), €3 million
    ($4 million) and €19 million ($22 million),
    respectively, was recorded in Other income (expense), net for
    the anticipated guaranteed annual payment.

On June 1, 2006, the guaranteed annual payment for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, which amounted to
    €3 million, was paid. In addition, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement entered into with plaintiff shareholders in
    March 2006, the Purchaser paid €1 million on
    June 30, 2006, the guaranteed annual payment for the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2006, to those shareholders who
    signed a letter waiving any further rights with respect to such
    guaranteed annual payment that ordinarily would become due and
    payable after the 2007 annual general meeting. Between
    June 30, 2006, and January 17, 2007, the Purchaser
    paid a total amount of less than €1 million to
    minority shareholders who required early payment of the
    guaranteed annual payment for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2006, by submitting such waiver letter after
    June 30, 2006.

On January 17, 2007, the Purchaser made, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement entered into with plaintiff shareholders in
    December 2006, the following guaranteed annual payments:
    (i) a total amount of €1 million was paid to all
    minority shareholders who had not yet requested early payment of
    the guaranteed annual payment for the fiscal year ended on
    September 30, 2006, and (ii) a total amount of
    €1 million representing the pro rata share of the
    guaranteed annual payment for the first five months of the
    fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 was paid to all
    minority shareholders.

The Domination Agreement cannot be terminated by the Purchaser
    in the ordinary course of business until September 30,
    2009. The Company’s subsidiaries, Celanese International
    Holdings Luxembourg S.à r.l. (“CIH”), formerly
    Celanese Caylux Holdings Luxembourg S.C.A., and Celanese US,
    have each agreed to provide the Purchaser with financing to
    strengthen the Purchaser’s ability to fulfill its
    obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
    Agreement and to ensure that the Purchaser will perform all of
    its obligations under, or in connection with, the Domination
    Agreement when such obligations become due, including, without
    limitation, the obligation to compensate CAG for any statutory
    annual loss incurred by CAG during the term of the Domination
    Agreement. If CIH

and/or

Celanese US are obligated to make payments under such guarantees
    or other security to the Purchaser, the Company may not have
    sufficient funds for payments on its indebtedness when due. The
    Company has not had to compensate CAG for an annual loss for any
    period during which the Domination Agreement has been in effect.

The Domination Agreement was challenged in eight Null and Void
    actions in the Frankfurt District Court. These actions were
    seeking to have the shareholders’ resolution approving the
    Domination Agreement declared null

F-8

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and void based on an alleged violation of formal requirements
    relating to the invitation for the May 2005 CAG
    shareholders’ meeting. In May 2007, the Frankfurt District
    Court dismissed all Null and Void actions.

The amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement are under
    court review in special award proceedings (see Note 24). As
    a result of these proceedings, either amount could be increased
    by the court so that all former CAG shareholders, including
    those who have already tendered their shares into the mandatory
    offer and have received the fair cash compensation could claim
    the respective higher amounts. Certain former CAG shareholders
    may initiate such proceedings also with respect to the
    Squeeze-Out compensation. In this case, former CAG shareholders
    who ceased to be shareholders of CAG due to the Squeeze-Out are
    entitled, pursuant to a settlement agreement between the
    Purchaser and certain former CAG shareholders, to claim for
    their shares the higher of the compensation amounts determined
    by the court in these different proceedings. Payments these
    shareholders already received as compensation for their shares
    will be offset so that those shareholders who ceased to be
    shareholders of CAG due to the Squeeze-Out are not entitled to
    more than the higher of the amount set in the two court
    proceedings.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

•
    Consolidation principles

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with US GAAP for all periods presented and include
    the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries
    over which the Company exercises control as well as variable
    interest entities where the Company is deemed the primary
    beneficiary, when applicable. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

•
    Estimates and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
    the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated charges
    during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to
    impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived
    assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and
    other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other
    postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations,
    environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

•
    Cash and cash equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered cash equivalents.

•
    Restricted cash

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $46 million
    of restricted cash. The cash was paid in January 2007 to certain
    CAG shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Squeeze-Out as
    discussed in Note 2.

•
    Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost includes raw
    materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Stores and
    supplies are valued at cost or market, whichever is lower. Cost
    for stores and supplies is primarily determined by the average
    cost method.

•
    Investments in marketable securities

The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity
    securities as “available-for-sale” and reports those
    investments at their fair market values in the balance sheet as
    Other assets. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the related tax
    effect on available-for-sale securities, are excluded from
    earnings and are reported as a component of

F-9

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net until
    realized. The cost of securities sold is determined by using the
    specific identification method.

A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security
    below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in
    a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment
    is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is
    established. To determine whether an impairment is
    other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the
    ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price
    recovery and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is
    recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence
    considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the
    impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes
    in value subsequent to year end, and forecasted performance of
    the investee.

•
    Investments in affiliates

Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments
    in Common Stock

, stipulates that the equity method should be
    used to account for investments whereby an investor has
    “the ability to exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of an investee”, but does
    not exercise control. APB Opinion No. 18 generally
    considers an investor to have the ability to exercise
    significant influence when it owns 20% or more of the voting
    stock of an investee. Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 35,

Criteria for
    Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
    Common Stock

, which was issued to clarify the criteria for
    applying the equity method of accounting to 50% or less owned
    companies, lists circumstances under which, despite 20%
    ownership, an investor may not be able to exercise significant
    influence. Certain investments where the Company owns greater
    than a 20% ownership and cannot exercise significant influence
    or control are accounted for under the cost method (see
    Note 9).

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    its investments whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline.
    A loss in value of an equity-method or cost-method investment
    which is other than a temporary decline will be recognized as
    the difference between the carrying amount of the investment and
    its fair value.

The Company’s estimates of fair value are determined based
    on a discounted cash flow model. The Company periodically
    engages third-party valuation consultants to assist with this
    process.

•
    Property, plant and equipment, net

Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings, machinery and
    equipment, including capitalized interest, and property under
    capital lease agreements, are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
    basis over the following estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets:

Land Improvements

20 years

Buildings and Building Improvements

30 years

Machinery and Equipment

20 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over ten years or the
    remaining life of the respective lease, whichever is shorter.

Accelerated depreciation is recorded when the estimated useful
    life is shortened. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs,
    including costs for planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not
    extend the useful life of the asset are charged to earnings as
    incurred. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and
    depreciation accounts until sold or otherwise disposed. In the
    case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed
    from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from
    disposal, are included in earnings.

Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their
    fair values and depreciated over the assets’ remaining
    useful lives or the Company’s policy lives, whichever is
    shorter.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount
    of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
    would be assessed when estimated undiscounted future cash flows
    from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less
    than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have
    identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other
    asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based
    on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its
    fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows
    or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Impairment losses are
    recorded in depreciation expense or Other (charges) gains, net
    depending on the facts and circumstances.

•
    Goodwill and other intangible assets

Patents, customer related intangible assets and other
    intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated useful lives. The weighted average
    amortization period is 8 years. The excess of the purchase
    price over fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities
    of an acquired business (“goodwill”) and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather
    tested for impairment, at least annually. The Company tests for
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment during
    the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill
    of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability
    is measured at the reporting unit level based on the provisions
    of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

. The Company’s estimates of fair
    value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. The
    Company periodically engages third-party valuation consultants
    to assist with this process. Impairment losses are recorded in
    other operating expense or Other (charges) gains, net depending
    on the facts and circumstances.

The Company assesses recoverability of other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the indefinite-lived intangible asset may not be fully
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset over its
    fair value. Any excess of the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value is
    recognized as an impairment loss. The Company’s estimates
    of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow
    model. The Company periodically engages third-party valuation
    consultants to assist with this process. Impairment losses are
    recorded in other operating expense or Other (charges) gains,
    net depending on the facts and circumstances.

The Company assesses the recoverability of finite-lived
    intangible assets in the same manner as for property, plant and
    equipment as described above. Impairment losses are recorded in
    amortization expense or Other (charges) gains, net depending on
    the facts and circumstances.

•
    Financial instruments

The Company manages its exposures to currency exchange rates,
    interest rates and commodity prices through a risk management
    program that includes the use of derivative financial
    instruments (see Note 23). The Company does not use
    derivative financial instruments for speculative trading
    purposes. The fair value of all derivative instruments are
    recorded as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date.
    Changes in the fair value of these instruments are reported in
    income or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net,
    depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies
    for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities

, as amended
    (“SFAS No. 133”).

Gains and losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash
    flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net, to the extent the hedges are effective,
    until the underlying transactions are recognized in income. To
    the extent effective, gains and losses on derivative and
    non-derivative instruments used as

F-11

CELANESE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign
    operations are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net as part of the cumulative translation
    adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and
    hedges of net investment in foreign operations, if any, are
    recognized in income immediately. Derivative instruments not
    designated as hedges are marked to market at the end of each
    accounting period with the change in fair value recorded in
    income.

•
    Concentrations of credit risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment
    by customers and counterparties. The creditworthiness of
    customers and counterparties is subject to continuing review,
    including the use of master netting agreements, where
    appropriate. The Company minimizes concentrations of credit risk
    through its global orientation in diverse businesses with a
    large number of diverse customers and suppliers. In addition,
    credit risks arising from derivative instruments is not
    significant because the counterparties to these contracts are
    primarily major international financial institutions and, to a
    lesser extent, major chemical companies. Generally, collateral
    is not required from customers and counterparties and allowances
    are provided for specific risks inherent in receivables.

•
    Deferred financing costs

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred to obtain debt
    financings and amortizes these costs using a method that
    approximates the effective interest rate method over the terms
    of the related debt. Upon the extinguishment of the related
    debt, any unamortized capitalized debt financing costs are
    immediately expensed.

•
    Environmental liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical
    products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the
    production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling,
    processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials.
    The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating
    to environmental matters if available information indicates that
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss is reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the
    site, the Company accrues through fifteen years, unless the
    Company has government orders or other agreements that extend
    beyond fifteen years. If the event of loss is neither probable
    nor reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible, the
    Company provides appropriate disclosure in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements if the contingency is
    considered material. The Company estimates environmental
    liabilities on a

case-by-case

basis using the most current status of available facts, existing
    technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior
    experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of
    environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets
    when their receipt is deemed probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated
    site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of
    the following types of costs: site investigation and testing
    costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water
    contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation
    monitoring costs. These reserves do not take into account any
    claims or recoveries from insurance. There are no pending
    insurance claims for any environmental liability that are
    expected to be material. The measurement of environmental
    liabilities is based on the Company’s periodic estimate of
    what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the
    remediation effort. The Company utilizes third parties to assist
    in the management and development of cost estimates for its
    sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors
    affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the
    consolidated financial statements in the period in which they
    occur (see Note 17).

•
    Legal fees

The Company accrues for legal fees related to loss contingency
    matters when the costs associated with defending these matters
    can be reasonably estimated and are probable of occurring. All
    other legal fees are expensed as incurred.

•
    Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have
    been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment of products, and provided that four basic criteria are
    met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and
    (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Should changes in
    conditions cause the Company to determine revenue recognition
    criteria are not met for certain transactions, revenue
    recognition would be delayed until such time that the
    transactions become realizable and fully earned. Payments
    received in advance of meeting the above revenue recognition
    criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.

•
    Stock-based compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”). The Company elected
    the modified prospective transition method as permitted by
    SFAS No. 123(R) and, accordingly, the year ended
    December 31, 2005 has not been restated to reflect the
    impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Under this transition
    method, compensation cost recognized includes:
    (i) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted
    prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006 (based
    on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    original provisions of SFAS No. 123 and previously
    presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures), and
    (ii) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006 (based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R)).

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”), the Company accounted for
    employee stock-based compensation for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 in accordance with APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”), using an intrinsic value
    approach to measure compensation expense, if any.

•
    Research and development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense
    in the period in which they are incurred.

•
    Insurance loss reserves

The Company has two wholly owned insurance companies (the
    “Captives”) that are used as a form of self insurance
    for property, liability and workers compensation risks. One of
    the Captives also insures certain third-party risks. The
    liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated
    risk of loss which is based on management estimates and
    actuarial valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the
    portion of the third-party premiums written applicable to the
    unexpired terms of the policies in-force. Liabilities are
    recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been
    developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and the
    Company can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition,
    liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure
    on both known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the
    liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly. It is possible
    that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded
    liabilities. Premiums written are recognized as revenue based on
    the terms of the policies. Capitalization of the Captives is
    determined by regulatory guidelines. Total assets and
    liabilities for the Captives after elimination of all
    intercompany activity was $300 million and
    $223 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007
    and $339 million and $171 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2006. Included in total liabilities are
    third-party reserves of $23 million and $24 million as
    of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Third-party
    premiums were $2 million, $22 million and
    $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

•
    Reinsurance receivables

The Captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their
    risk of loss. The reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the
    Captives from their obligations to policyholders. Failure of the
    reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to
    the Captives. The Captives evaluate the financial condition of
    their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to
    minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
    insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed
    non-collectible.

•
    Income taxes

The provision for income taxes has been determined using the
    asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
    Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
    effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
    amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and
    tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these
    temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are
    expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or
    the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and
    laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the
    balance sheet date.

The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

(“FIN 48”) on January 1,
    2007. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and
    estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require
    periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate
    actual outcomes. Tax positions are recognized only when it is
    more likely than not, (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on
    technical merits, that the positions will be sustained upon
    examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
    threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as
    the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax
    position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts
    and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all
    available evidence.

    Accounting for sorbates matters

On October 22, 1999, CAG was demerged from Hoechst AG
    (“Hoechst”). In accordance with the demerger agreement
    between Hoechst and CAG, CAG was assigned the obligation related
    to the sorbates matters (see Note 24). However, Hoechst
    agreed to indemnify CAG for 80% of payments for such
    obligations. Expenses related to this matter are recorded gross
    of any such recoveries from Hoechst, and its legal successors,
    in the consolidated statement of operations. Recoveries from
    Hoechst, and its legal successors, which represent 80% of such
    expenses, are recorded directly to Shareholders’ equity,
    net of tax, as a contribution of capital in the consolidated
    balance sheet.

    Accounting for purchasing agent agreements

CPO Celanese Aktiengesell Schaft &

    parties. CPO arranges sale and purchase agreements for raw
    materials on a commission basis. Accordingly, the commissions
    earned on these third-party sales are classified as a reduction
    to Selling, general and administrative expenses. Commissions
    amounted to $4 million, $5 million and $9 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The raw material sales volume commissioned by CPO
    for third parties amounted to $574 million,
    $937 million and $880 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Recent
    accounting pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used for financial
    and non-financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157
    does not require any new fair value measurements but rather
    eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior
    accounting pronouncements. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position No.

157-2,

“Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement
    157”

(“FSP

No. 157-2”),

which defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for certain
    non-financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157
    became effective for the Company on January 1, 2008 for
    financial assets and liabilities. The impact of adoption on
    financial assets and liabilities other than pension assets did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS No. 157
    becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 for
    non-financial assets and liabilities. The impact of adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 on non-financial assets and liabilities and
    pension assets is not expected to have a significant impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows. However, the Company will continue to evaluate its
    fair value measurements for non-financial assets and liabilities
    and pension assets.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(“SFAS No. 159”). This
    standard permits companies to choose to measure many financial
    assets and liabilities and certain other items at fair value. A
    company will report unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be applied
    on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, with several exceptions, such as those investments
    accounted for by the equity method, and once elected, the option
    is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. The fair value
    option can be applied only to entire instruments and not to
    portions thereof. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does
    not expect the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 to be
    material to the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. FIN 48-1,

Definition of Settlement in FIN 48

. This FSP
    clarifies FIN 48 to provide guidance that a company may
    recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax
    position is effectively (as opposed to “ultimately”)
    settled through examination, negotiation or litigation. The
    Company incorporated the guidance in this FSP during 2007. See
    Note 20 for additional information regarding the impact of
    adopting FIN 48.

In June 2007, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) reached a conclusion on EITF Issue

No. 06-11,

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards

(“EITF

No. 06-11”).

The scope of EITF

No. 06-11

consists of the application to share-based payment arrangements
    with dividend protection features that entitle employees to
    receive (a) dividends on equity-classified non-vested
    shares, (b) dividend equivalents on equity-classified
    non-vested share units or (c) payments equal to the
    dividends paid on the underlying shares while an
    equity-classified share option is outstanding, when those
    dividends or dividend equivalents are charged to retained
    earnings under SFAS No. 123(R) and result in an income
    tax deduction for the employer. EITF

No. 06-11

should be applied prospectively to the income tax benefits of
    dividends on equity-classified employee share-based payment
    awards that are declared in fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2007. The Company does not expect the impact
    of adopting EITF

No. 06-11

to be material to the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements

(“SFAS No. 160”).
    SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research
    Bulletin 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards
    for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership
    interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as
    equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes
    a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s
    ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in
    deconsolidation. SFAS No. 160 is

F-16

    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact of adopting SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”).
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its
    financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, the goodwill acquired and any
    non-controlling interest in the acquiree. This statement also
    establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of
    the nature of the financial effect of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for all business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
    beginning of the first fiscal year after December 15, 2008,
    with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on
    deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies.
    SFAS No. 141(R) amends SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, such that adjustments made
    to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax
    contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to
    the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R) would also apply
    the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R). The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 141(R) on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

Acquisitions,
    ventures and divestitures

Acquisitions:

On January 31, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition
    of the cellulose acetate flake, tow and film business of Acetate
    Products Limited (“APL”), a subsidiary of Corsadi B.V.
    The purchase price for the transaction was approximately
    £57 million ($112 million), in addition to direct
    acquisition costs of approximately £4 million
    ($7 million). Pro forma financial information has not been
    provided as the acquisition did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s results of operations. As contemplated prior
    to the closing of the acquisition, in September 2007, the
    Company closed the acquired tow production plant at Little
    Heath, United Kingdom. In accordance with the Company’s
    sponsor services agreement dated January 26, 2005, as
    amended, the Company paid the Advisor $1 million in
    connection with the acquisition. The acquired business is
    included in the Company’s Consumer Specialties segment (see
    Note 26 for additional information on the Company’s
    reportable segments).

The following table presents the allocation of the acquisition
    costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on
    their fair values:

Net assets acquired


On April 6, 2004, the Company acquired 84% of
    CAG. During 2005, the Company acquired an additional 14% of
    CAG. As a result of the effective registration of the
    Squeeze-Out in the commercial register in Germany in December
    2006, the Company acquired the remaining 2% of CAG in January
    2007 (see Note 2 for additional information on the
    acquisition of CAG).

In February 2005, the Company acquired Vinamul, the North
    American and European emulsion polymer business of Imperial
    Chemical Industries PLC (“ICI”) for $208 million,
    in addition to direct acquisition costs of $9 million.
    Vinamul operates manufacturing facilities in the United States,
    Canada, the United Kingdom and the

F-17

    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Netherlands. As part of the agreement, ICI will continue to
    supply Vinamul with starch, dextrin and other specialty
    ingredients following the acquisition. The Company will supply
    ICI with vinyl acetate monomer and polyvinyl alcohols. The
    supply agreements are for fifteen years and the pricing is based
    on market and other negotiated terms. The fair value of the
    supply contract was approximately $11 million and was
    recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the fifteen
    year life of the agreement.

In July 2005, the Company acquired Acetex Corporation
    (“Acetex”) for $270 million, in addition to
    direct acquisition costs of $16 million and assumed
    Acetex’s $247 million of debt, which is net of cash
    acquired of $54 million. Acetex has two primary
    businesses — its Acetyls business and its Specialty
    Polymers and Films businesses (see divestitures below for
    discussion of the sale of the Films business). The Acetyls
    business is operated in Europe and the Polymers and Film
    businesses are operated in North America.

Ventures:

In March 2007, the Company entered into a strategic partnership
    with Accsys Technologies PLC (“Accsys”), and its
    subsidiary, Titan Wood, to become the exclusive supplier of
    acetyl products to Titan Wood’s technology licensees for
    use in wood acetylation. In connection with this partnership, in
    May 2007, the Company acquired 8,115,883 shares of
    Accsys’ common stock representing approximately 5.45% of
    the total voting shares of Accsys for €22 million
    ($30 million). The investment is treated as an
    available-for-sale security (see Note 6) and is
    included as a component of current Other assets on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. On November 20,
    2007, the Company and Accsys announced that they agreed to amend
    their business arrangements so that each company will have a
    nonexclusive “at-will” trading and supply relationship
    to give both companies greater flexibility. As part of this
    amendment, the Company has the ability to sell its common stock
    ownership in Accsys through an orderly placement of the
    Company’s Accsys shares. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company sold 1,238,016 shares of Accsys’ common stock
    for approximately €4 million ($6 million), which
    resulted in a gain of approximately $1 million.

In August 2005, the Company and Hatco Corporation agreed to wind
    up Estech GmbH, its venture for neopropyl esters. The Company
    recorded an impairment charge of $10 million, included in
    Equity in net earnings of affiliates, related to this matter
    during the year ended December 31, 2005.

In April 2004, the Company and a group of investors led by
    Conduit Ventures Ltd. entered into a venture, which was named
    Pemeas GmbH. This venture was formed in order to advance the
    commercialization of the Company’s fuel cell technology.
    Pemeas GmbH was considered a variable interest entity as defined
    under FIN No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities

(“FIN No. 46(R)”). The
    Company was deemed the primary beneficiary of this variable
    interest entity and, accordingly, consolidated this entity in
    its consolidated financial statements. In the period the Company
    adopted FIN No. 46(R), the consolidation of this
    entity did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations and cash flows. In
    December 2005, the Company sold its common stock interest in
    Pemeas GmbH, which resulted in the Company no longer being the
    primary beneficiary. The Company recognized a gain of less than
    $1 million related to this sale. In December 2006, the
    Company sold its preferred interest in Pemeas GmbH to BASF AG,
    received net proceeds from the sale of €9 million and
    recognized a gain of €8 million ($11 million).
    This amount is included in Other income (expense), net in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

Divestitures:

On August 20, 2007, the Company sold its Films business of
    AT Plastics, located in Edmonton and Westlock, Alberta, Canada,
    to British Polythene Industries PLC (“BPI”) for
    $12 million. The Films business manufactures products for
    the agricultural, horticultural and construction industries. The
    Company recorded a loss on the sale of approximately
    $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007.
    The Company maintained ownership of the Polymers business of AT
    Plastics, which concentrates on the development and supply of
    specialty resins and compounds. AT Plastics is included in the
    Company’s Industrial Specialties segment. The Company
    concluded that

F-18

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the sale of the Films business of AT Plastics is not a
    discontinued operation due to the level of continuing cash flows
    between the Films business and AT Plastics’ Polymers
    business subsequent to the sale. Under the terms of the purchase
    agreement, the Company entered into a two year sales agreement
    to continue selling product to BPI through August 2009.

In connection with the Company’s strategy to optimize its
    portfolio and divest non-core operations, the Company announced
    on December 13, 2006 its agreement to sell its Acetyl
    Intermediates segment’s oxo products and derivatives
    businesses, including European Oxo GmbH (“EOXO”), a


/


venture between CAG and Degussa AG (“Degussa”), to
    Advent International, for a purchase price of
    €480 million ($636 million) subject to final
    agreement adjustments and the successful exercise of the
    Company’s option to purchase Degussa’s 50% interest in
    EOXO. On February 23, 2007, the option was exercised and
    the Company acquired Degussa’s interest in the venture for
    a purchase price of €30 million ($39 million), in
    addition to €22 million ($29 million) paid to
    extinguish EOXO’s debt upon closing of the transaction. The
    Company completed the sale of its oxo products and derivatives
    businesses, including the acquired 50% interest in EOXO, on
    February 28, 2007. The sale included the oxo and
    derivatives businesses at the Oberhausen, Germany, and Bay City,
    Texas facilities as well as portions of its Bishop, Texas
    facility. Also included were EOXO’s facilities within the
    Oberhausen and Marl, Germany plants. The former oxo products and
    derivatives businesses acquired by Advent International was
    renamed Oxea. Taking into account agreed deductions by the buyer
    for pension and other employee benefits and various costs for
    separation activities, the Company received proceeds of
    approximately €443 million ($585 million) at
    closing. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a
    $47 million pre-tax gain, which includes certain working
    capital and other adjustments, in 2007. Due to certain
    lease-back arrangements between the Company and the buyer and
    related environmental obligations of the Company, approximately
    $51 million of the transaction proceeds attributable to the
    fair value of the underlying land at Bay City ($1 million)
    and Oberhausen (€36 million) is included in deferred
    proceeds in long-term Other liabilities, and divested land with
    a book value of $14 million (€10 million at
    Oberhausen and $1 million at Bay City) remains on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Subsequent to closing, the Company and Oxea have certain site
    service and product supply arrangements. The site services
    include, but are not limited to, administrative, utilities,
    health and safety, waste water treatment and maintenance
    activities for terms which range from one to fifteen years.
    Product supply agreements contain initial terms of up to fifteen
    years. The Company has no contractual ability through these
    agreements or any other arrangements to significantly influence
    the operating or financial policies of Oxea. The Company
    concluded, based on the nature and limited projected magnitude
    of the continuing business relationship between the Company and
    Oxea, that the divestiture of the oxo products and derivatives
    businesses should be accounted for as a discontinued operation.

Third-party sales include $5 million, $35 million and
    $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, that would have been eliminated
    upon consolidation were the divestiture not accounted for as a
    discontinued operation. These amounts relate to sales from the
    continuing operations of the Company to the divested businesses.

In accordance with the Company’s sponsor services agreement
    dated January 26, 2005, as amended, the Company paid the
    Advisor $6 million in connection with the sale of the oxo
    products and derivatives businesses.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company discontinued its
    Pentaerythritol (“PE”) operations, which were included
    in the Acetyl Intermediates segment. During the second quarter
    of 2007, the Company discontinued its Edmonton, Canada methanol
    operations, which were included in the Acetyl Intermediates
    segment. As a result, the earnings (loss) from operations
    related to the Edmonton methanol and PE operations are reflected
    as components of discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

In December 2005, the Company sold its Cyclo-olefine Copolymer
    (“COC”) business to a venture of Japan’s Daicel
    Chemical Industries Ltd. (“Daicel”) and Polyplastics
    Co. Ltd. (“Polyplastics”). Daicel holds a majority
    stake in the venture with 55% interest and Polyplastics, which
    itself is a venture between the Company and Daicel, owns the
    remaining 45%. The transaction resulted in a loss of
    approximately $35 million.

In October 2004, the Company announced plans to implement a
    strategic restructuring of its acetate business to increase
    efficiency, reduce overcapacity in certain areas and to focus on
    products and markets that provide long-term value. As part of
    this restructuring, the Company announced its plans to
    discontinue its filament operations, which were included in the
    Consumer Specialties segment, prior to December 31, 2005
    and to consolidate its acetate flake and tow manufacturing
    operations. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
    discontinued its filament operations. As a result, the earnings
    (loss) from operations related to the filament operations are
    reflected as a component of discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

In July 2005, in connection with the Vinamul transaction, the
    Company agreed to sell its emulsion powders business to ICI for
    approximately $25 million. This transaction included a
    supply agreement whereby the Company supplies product to ICI for
    a period of up to fifteen years. In connection with the sale,
    the Company reduced goodwill related to the acquisition of
    Vinamul by $6 million. The transaction closed in September
    2005.

Asset
    Sales:

In December 2007, the Company sold the assets at its Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada facility to a real estate developer for
    approximately $35 million. As part of the agreement, the
    Company will retain certain environmental liabilities associated
    with the site. The Company derecognized approximately
    $16 million of asset retirement obligations which were
    transferred to the buyer. As a result of the sale, the Company
    recorded a gain of approximately $37 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

On July 31, 2007, the Company reached an agreement with
    Babcock & Brown, a worldwide investment firm, which
    specializes in real estate and utilities development, to sell
    its Pampa, Texas, facility. The Company will maintain its
    chemical operations at the site until at least 2009. Proceeds
    received upon certain milestone events are treated as deferred
    proceeds and included in long-term Other liabilities until the
    transaction is complete, as defined in the sales agreement.

In October 2005, the Company sold its Rock Hill, SC
    manufacturing facility for $4 million in cash. As a result
    the Company derecognized $12 million of asset retirement
    obligations and $7 million of environmental liabilities
    which were legally transferred to the buyer, and recorded a gain
    of $23 million.

Certain cost investments where the Company owns greater than a
    20% ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method
    of accounting because the Company cannot exercise significant
    influence over these entities. The Company determined that it
    cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to
    local government investment in and influence over these
    entities, limitations on the Company’s involvement in the
    day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities
    to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance
    with US GAAP.

During 2007, the Company wrote-off its remaining
    €1 million ($1 million) cost investment in
    European Pipeline Development Company B.V. (“EPDC”)
    and expensed €7 million ($9 million), included in
    Other income (expense), net, associated with contingent
    liabilities that became payable due to the Company’s
    decision to exit the pipeline development project. The
    investment in EPDC related to the construction of a pipeline
    system, solely dedicated to the transportation of propylene,
    which was to connect Rotterdam via Antwerp, Netherlands, with
    the Company’s Oberhausen and Marl production facilities in
    Germany. However, on February 15, 2007, EPDC shareholders
    voted to cease the pipeline project as originally envisaged and
    go into liquidation. The Company was a 12.5% shareholder of EPDC.

During 2007, the Company fully impaired its $5 million cost
    investment in Elemica Corporation (“Elemica”). Elemica
    is a network for the global chemical industry developed by 22 of
    the leading chemical companies in the world for the benefit of
    the entire industry. The Company is a 1.83% shareholder of
    Elemica through its preferred share holdings. As part of
    Elemica’s planned capital reorganization in 2007, its board
    of directors has proposed to convert all outstanding preferred
    stock into shares of Elemica’s common stock. Based on the
    Company’s analysis of

Elemica’s proposed capital reorganization, past earnings

    its cost investment in Elemica was impaired. The impairment was

The Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement
    obligations related to certain of its existing operating
    facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include
    demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration
    activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the
    retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or
    abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company
    currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities
    indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value
    cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company
    considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites,
    an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time.
    If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset
    retirement obligations could significantly affect the
    Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

As of December 31, 2006, the amended and restated (January
    2005) senior credit facilities consisted of a term loan
    facility, a revolving credit facility and a credit-linked
    revolving facility. The $600 million revolving credit
    facility provided for the availability of letters of credit in
    US dollars and Euros and for borrowings on

same-day

notice. As of December 31, 2006, there were no letters of
    credit issued or outstanding borrowings under the revolving
    credit facility; accordingly, $600 million remained
    available for borrowing. The Company had an approximate
    $228 million credit-linked revolving facility available for
    the issuance of letters of credit. As of

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006, there were $218 million of letters
    of credit issued under the credit-linked revolving facility and
    $10 million remained available for borrowing.

Debt
    Refinancing

In March 2007, the Company announced a comprehensive
    recapitalization plan to refinance its debt and repurchase
    shares. On April 2, 2007, the Company, through certain of
    its subsidiaries, entered into a new senior credit agreement.
    The new senior credit agreement consists of $2,280 million
    of US dollar denominated and €400 million of Euro
    denominated term loans due 2014, a $650 million revolving
    credit facility terminating in 2013 and a $228 million
    credit-linked revolving facility terminating in 2014. Borrowings
    under the new senior credit agreement bear interest at a
    variable interest rate based on LIBOR (for US dollars) or
    EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable, or, for US dollar
    denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in
    each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for
    the term loans and any loans under the credit-linked revolving
    facility is 1.75%, subject to potential reductions as defined in
    the new senior credit agreement. The term loans under the new
    senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the
    initial principal amount per annum, payable quarterly. The
    remaining principal amount of the term loans is due on
    April 2, 2014.

As of December 31, 2007, there were $129 million of
    letters of credit issued under the credit-linked revolving
    facility and $99 million remained available for borrowing.
    As of December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding
    borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
    credit facility; accordingly $650 million remained
    available for borrowing.

The new senior credit agreement is guaranteed by Celanese
    Holdings LLC and certain domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US,
    and is secured by a lien on substantially all assets of Celanese
    US and such guarantors, subject to certain agreed exceptions,
    pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of
    April 2, 2007, by and among Celanese Holdings LLC, Celanese
    US, certain subsidiaries of Celanese US and Deutsche Bank AG,
    New York Branch, as Administrative Agent and as Collateral Agent.

The new senior credit agreement contains a number of covenants
    that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict, among other
    things, the ability of Celanese Holdings LLC and its
    subsidiaries to incur new debt, repurchase shares, make certain
    investments, acquire new entities, sell assets and pay dividends
    in excess of amounts specified in the agreement. Additionally,
    the revolving credit facility requires Celanese Holdings LLC and
    its subsidiaries to maintain a maximum First-Lien Senior Secured
    Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, when there is
    outstanding credit exposure under the revolver. The Company is
    in compliance with all of the covenants related to its debt
    agreements as of December 31, 2007.

Proceeds from the new senior credit agreement, together with
    available cash, were used to retire the Company’s
    $2,454 million amended and restated (January
    2005) senior credit facilities, which consisted of
    $1,626 million in term loans due 2011, a $600 million
    revolving credit facility terminating in 2009 and an approximate
    $228 million credit-linked revolving facility terminating
    in 2009, and to retire all of the Company’s Senior
    Subordinated Notes and Senior Discount Notes as discussed below.

On March 6, 2007, the Company commenced cash tender offers
    (the “Tender Offers”) with respect to any and all of
    the outstanding 10% senior discount notes due 2014 and
    10.5% senior discount notes due 2014 (the “Senior
    Discount Notes”), and any and all of the outstanding
    9.625% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and
    10.375% senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the
    “Senior Subordinated Notes”). The Tender Offers
    expired on April 2, 2007. Substantially all of the Senior
    Discount Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes were tendered in
    conjunction with the Tender Offers. The remaining outstanding
    Senior Discount Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes not tendered
    in conjunction with the Tender Offers were redeemed by the
    Company in May 2007 through optional redemption allowed in the
    indentures.

Benefit
    Obligations

Pension obligations.

Pension obligations are
    established for benefits payable in the form of retirement,
    disability and surviving dependent pensions. The benefits
    offered vary according to the legal, fiscal and economic
    conditions of each country. The commitments result from
    participation in defined contribution and defined benefit plans,
    primarily in the US. Benefits are dependent on years of service
    and the employee’s compensation. Supplemental retirement
    benefits provided to certain employees are nonqualified for US
    tax purposes. Separate trusts have been established for some
    nonqualified plans.

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company’s US qualified pension plan represented greater
    than 83% and 75% of Celanese’s pension plan assets and
    liabilities, respectively. Independent trusts or insurance
    companies administer the majority of these plans. Pension costs
    under the Company’s retirement plans are actuarially
    determined.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia covering certain employees. Employees
    may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these
    contributions in varying amounts. The Company’s matching
    contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on
    specified percentages of employee contributions and aggregated
    $12 million, $11 million and $12 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company participates in multiemployer defined benefit
    pension plans in Europe covering certain employees. The
    Company’s contributions to the multiemployer defined
    benefit pension plans are based on specified percentages of
    employee contributions and aggregated $7 million,
    $7 million and $6 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Other postretirement obligations.

Certain
    retired employees receive postretirement healthcare and life
    insurance benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which
    has the right to modify or terminate these plans at any time.
    The cost for coverage is shared between the Company and the
    employee. The cost of providing retiree health care and life
    insurance benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over
    the service period of the active employee group. The
    Company’s policy is to fund benefits as claims and premiums
    are paid. The US plan was closed to new participants effective
    January 1, 2006.

    income (loss), excluding appreciation of insurance contracts, of
    $5 million, $5 million and $6 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    In addition to holding marketable securities, the nonqualified
    trust holds investments in insurance contracts of
    $68 million and $66 million as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Valuation

The Company uses the corridor approach in the valuation of the
    defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits. The
    corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses
    resulting from variances between actual results and economic
    estimates or actuarial assumptions. For defined benefit pension
    plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when
    the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the
    market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. For other
    postretirement benefits, amortization occurs when the net gains
    and losses exceed 10% of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. The amount in excess of
    the corridor is amortized over the average remaining service
    period to retirement date for active plan participants or, for
    retired participants, the average remaining life expectancy.

The following tables set forth the principal weighted-average
    assumptions used:

The expected rate of return assumptions for plan assets are
    based mainly on historical performance achieved over a long
    period of time (15 to 20 years) encompassing many business
    and economic cycles. Adjustments, upward and downward, may be
    made to those historical returns to reflect future capital
    market expectations; these expectations are typically derived
    from expert advice from the investment community and surveys of
    peer company assumptions.

The Company determines its assumption for the discount rates to
    be used for the purposes of computing annual service and
    interest costs for its US plans based on the yields of high
    quality corporate/government bonds with a duration appropriate
    to the duration of the plan obligations.

The Company determines its discount rates in the Euro zone using
    the iBoxx Euro Corporate AA Bond indices with appropriate
    adjustments for the duration of the plan obligations. In other
    International locations, the Company determines its discount
    rates based on the yields of high quality government bonds with
    a duration appropriate to the duration of the plan obligations.

On January 1, 2007, the Company’s health care cost
    trend assumption for US postretirement medical plan’s net
    periodic benefit cost was 8.5% for the first two years grading
    down 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. On January 1,
    2006, the health care cost trend rate was 9% per year grading
    down 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
    one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed health
    care cost trend rate would impact postretirement obligations by
    $4 million and $(3) million, respectively. The effect
    of a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care
    cost trend rate would have a less than $1 million impact on
    service and interest cost.

Impact
    of Remeasurement

As a result of the sale of the oxo products and derivatives
    businesses in February 2007 (see Note 5), there was a
    reduction of approximately 1,076 employees triggering a
    settlement and remeasurement of the affected pension plans due
    to certain changes in actuarial valuation assumptions. The
    settlement and remeasurement resulted in a net increase in the
    projected benefit obligation of $44 million with an offset
    to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net (net of
    tax of $1 million) and a settlement gain of
    $11 million (included in Gain on disposal of discontinued
    operations) for the pension plan during the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company finalized the
    shutdown of its Edmonton, Canada methanol operations. This
    resulted in the reduction of approximately 175 employees
    triggering a final settlement gain of less than $1 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2007. The settlement and
    remeasurement resulted in a net decrease in the projected
    benefit obligation of approximately $3 million. The final
    cash payout due was approximately CDN $30 million
    ($29 million) and was paid during the third quarter of 2007.

The financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are
    established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each
    plan’s liability structure. The Company’s asset
    allocation policy is based on a detailed asset/liability
    analysis. In developing investment policy and financial goals,
    consideration is given to the plan’s demographics, the
    returns and risks associated with alternative investment
    strategies, and the current and projected cash, expense and
    funding ratios of the plan. The investment policy must also
    comply with local statutory requirements as determined by each
    country. A formal asset/liability mix study of the plan is
    undertaken every 3 to 5 years or whenever there has been a
    material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or
    funding status and investment market. The Company has adopted a
    long-term investment horizon such that the risk and duration of
    investment losses are weighed against the long-term potential
    for appreciation of assets. Although there cannot be complete
    assurance that these objectives will be realized, it is believed
    that the likelihood for their realization is reasonably high,
    based upon the asset allocation chosen and the historical and
    expected performance of the asset classes utilized by the plans.
    The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified across
    asset classes, investment styles, investment managers, developed
    and emerging markets, business sectors and securities in order
    to moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments may be in
    separate accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and other
    pooled asset portfolios provided they all conform to fiduciary
    standards.

External investment managers are hired to manage the pension
    assets. An investment consultant assists with the screening
    process for each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the
    investment portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a
    composite of market indices that are weighted to match each
    plan’s target asset allocation. Long-term is considered 3
    to 5 years; however, incidences of underperformance are
    analyzed. The portfolio return

should also (over the long term) meet or exceed the return used
    for actuarial calculations in order to minimize future pension
    contributions and escalation in pension expense.

Employer contributions for pension benefits and postretirement
    benefits are expected to be $40 million and
    $34 million, respectively, in 2008. The table below

Environmental

General

— The Company is subject to
    environmental laws and regulations worldwide which impose
    limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and
    water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and
    disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes
    that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable
    environmental laws and regulations. The Company is also subject
    to retained environmental obligations specified in various
    contractual agreements arising from the divestiture of certain
    businesses by the Company or one of its predecessor companies.

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company’s expenditures, including expenditures for legal
    compliance, internal environmental initiatives and remediation
    of active, orphan, divested and US Superfund sites (as defined
    below) were $83 million, $71 million and
    $84 million, respectively. The Company’s capital
    project related environmental expenditures for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $14 million,
    $5 million and $8 million, respectively. Environmental
    reserves for remediation matters were $115 million and
    $114 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which represents the Company’s best estimate
    of its liability.

Remediation

— Due to its industrial history and
    through retained contractual and legal obligations, the Company
    has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its own sites
    as well as on divested, orphan or US

F-39

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Superfund sites. In addition, as part of the demerger agreement
    between the Company and Hoechst, a specified portion of the
    responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of
    Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Company. The Company
    provides for such obligations when the event of loss is probable
    and reasonably estimable.

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    total remediation efforts charged to cost of sales were
    $4 million, $6 million and $4 million,
    respectively. The Company believes that environmental
    remediation costs will not have a material adverse effect on the
    financial position of the Company, but may have a material
    adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any
    given accounting period.

The Company did not record any insurance recoveries related to
    these matters for the reported periods. There are no receivables
    for insurance recoveries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    however, as of December 31, 2007, there is a
    $13 million receivable from a former owner of an acquired
    business.

German InfraServs

— On January 1, 1997,
    coinciding with a reorganization of the Hoechst businesses in
    Germany, real estate service companies (“InfraServs”)
    were created to own directly the land and property and to
    provide various technical and administrative services at each of
    the manufacturing locations. The Company has manufacturing
    operations at two InfraServ locations in Germany: Frankfurt am
    Main-Hoechst and Kelsterbach, and holds interests in the
    companies which own and operate the former Hoechst sites in
    Gendorf, Knapsack and Wiesbaden.

InfraServs are liable for any residual contamination and other
    pollution because they own the real estate on which the
    individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, as the responsible party under German public
    law, is liable to third parties for all environmental damage
    that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and
    real estate. The contribution agreements entered into in 1997
    between Hoechst and the respective operating companies, as part
    of the divestiture of these companies, provide that the
    operating companies will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, against environmental liabilities resulting from the
    transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServs have agreed
    to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against any
    environmental liability arising out of or in connection with
    environmental pollution of any site. Likewise, in certain
    circumstances the Company could be responsible for the
    elimination of residual contamination on a few sites that were
    not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst,
    and its legal successors, must reimburse the Company for
    two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between
    the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination
    caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which
    cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no
    third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the
    InfraServ Partnership. In view of this potential obligation to
    eliminate residual contamination, the InfraServs, primarily
    relating to equity and cost affiliates which are not
    consolidated by the Company, have reserves of $88 million
    and $78 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective
    indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination,
    the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ
    companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a
    number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are
    not satisfied by either the InfraServs or their owners, these
    liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with
    the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any
    such costs. Likewise, in certain circumstances the Company could
    be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on
    several sites that were not transferred to InfraServ companies,
    in which case Hoechst, and its legal successors, must also
    reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.
    The German InfraServs are owned partially by the Company, as
    noted below, and the remaining ownership is held by various
    other companies.

US Superfund Sites

— In the US, the Company may
    be subject to substantial claims brought by US federal or state
    regulatory agencies or private individuals pursuant to statutory
    authority or common law. In particular, the Company has a
    potential liability under the US Federal Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
    as amended, and related state laws (collectively referred to as
    “Superfund”) for investigation and cleanup costs at
    approximately 50 sites. At most of these sites, numerous
    companies, including certain companies comprising the Company,
    or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the
    Environmental Protection Agency, state governing bodies or
    private individuals consider such companies to be potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) under Superfund or related
    laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various
    stages. The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites
    and the status of the insurance coverage for most of these
    proceedings is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot
    determine accurately its ultimate liability for investigation or
    cleanup costs at these sites. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Company had provisions totaling $13 million and
    $15 million, respectively, for US Superfund sites and
    utilized $1 million, $1 million and $2 million of
    these reserves during the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Additional provisions and
    adjustments recorded during the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005 approximately offset these expenditures.

As events progress at each site for which it has been named a
    PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site
    cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these
    liabilities, the Company considers its shipment of waste to a
    site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the
    types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the
    magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the
    number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company will join
    with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that will
    settle, among PRPs, each party’s percentage allocation of
    costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ
    from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities
    and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most
    current information available.

Hoechst Liabilities

— In connection with the
    Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and
    its legal successors, for the first €250 million of
    future remediation liabilities for environmental damages arising
    from 19 specified divested Hoechst entities. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, reserves of $27 million
    and $33 million, respectively, for these matters are
    included as a component of the total environmental reserves. As
    of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company, has made total
    cumulative payments of $46 million and $44 million,
    respectively. If such future liabilities exceed
    €250 million, Hoechst, and its legal successors, will
    bear such excess up to an additional €500 million.
    Thereafter, the Company will bear one-third and Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, will bear two-thirds of any further
    environmental remediation liabilities. Where the Company is
    unable to reasonably determine the probability of loss or
    estimate such loss under this indemnification, the Company has
    not recognized any liabilities relative to this indemnification.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has $240 million aggregate liquidation
    preference of outstanding preferred stock. Holders of the
    preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if,
    declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, out of funds
    legally available, cash dividends at the rate of 4.25% per annum
    of liquidation preference, payable quarterly in arrears,
    commencing on May 1, 2005. Dividends on the preferred stock
    are cumulative from the date of initial issuance. Accumulated
    but unpaid dividends accumulate at an annual rate of 4.25%. The
    preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at
    any time into approximately 1.25 shares of Series A
    common stock, subject to adjustments, per $25.00 liquidation
    preference of preferred stock and upon conversion will be
    recorded in Shareholders’ equity.

During 2007 and 2006, the Company declared and paid
    $10 million of cash dividends in each period on its 4.25%
    convertible perpetual preferred stock.

Initial
    Public Offering

In January 2005, the Company completed an initial public
    offering of 50,000,000 shares of Series A common stock
    and received net proceeds of $752 million after deducting
    underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses of
    $48 million. Concurrently, the Company received net
    proceeds of $233 million from the offering of its
    convertible perpetual preferred stock.

On March 9, 2005, the Company issued a 7,500,000
    Series A common stock dividend to the Original Shareholders
    (see Note 18) of its Series B common stock.

On April 7, 2005, the Company used the remaining proceeds
    of the initial public offering and concurrent financings to pay
    a special cash dividend declared on March 8, 2005 to
    holders of the Company’s Series B common stock of

Additional
    Paid-in Capital

In connection with the demerger and pursuant to the Demerger
    Agreement executed and delivered by the Company and Hoechst, the
    Company assumed certain of Hoechst’s businesses as well as
    certain contractual rights, including indemnifications. For the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    recorded $4 million, $3 million and $5 million,
    respectively, increases in Additional paid-in capital related to
    recoveries due from Hoechst, and its legal successors, for the
    antitrust matters in the sorbates industry (see Note 24).

Dividends

During 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a
    policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a
    quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company’s
    Series A common stock at an annual rate of $0.16 per share
    unless the Company’s Board of Directors, in its sole
    discretion, determines otherwise. Further, such dividends
    payable to holders of the Company’s Series A common
    stock cannot be declared or paid nor can any funds be set aside
    for the payment thereof, unless the Company has paid or set
    aside funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid
    dividends with respect to the shares of the Company’s
    preferred stock, as described above.

During 2007 and 2006, the Company declared and paid
    $25 million and $26 million, respectively, of cash
    dividends to holders of its Series A common shares.

On March 8, 2005, the Company declared a special cash
    dividend to holders of the Company’s Series B common
    stock of $804 million, which was paid on April 7,
    2005. Upon payment of the $804 million dividend, all of the
    outstanding shares of Series B common stock converted
    automatically to shares of Series A common stock.

Treasury
    Stock

In conjunction with the April 2007 debt refinancing discussed in
    Note 15, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
    CIH, repurchased 2,021,775 shares of its outstanding
    Series A common stock in a modified “Dutch
    Auction” tender offer from public shareholders, which
    expired on April 3, 2007, at a purchase price of $30.50 per
    share. The total price paid for these shares was approximately
    $62 million. The number of shares purchased in the tender
    offer represented approximately 1.3% of the Company’s
    outstanding Series A common stock at that time. The Company
    also separately purchased, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
    CIH, 329,011 shares of the Company’s Series A
    common stock at $30.50 per share from the investment funds
    associated with The Blackstone Group L.P. The total price paid
    for these shares was approximately $10 million. The number
    of shares purchased from Blackstone represented approximately
    0.2% of the Company’s outstanding Series A common
    stock at that time.

Additionally, on June 4, 2007, the Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $330 million
    of its Series A common stock. During 2007, the Company
    repurchased 8,487,700 shares of its Series A common
    stock at an average purchase price of $38.88 per share for a
    total of approximately $330 million pursuant to this
    authorization. The Company completed repurchasing shares related
    to this authorization during July 2007.

These purchases reduced the number of shares outstanding and the
    repurchased shares may be used by the Company for compensation
    programs utilizing the Company’s stock and other corporate
    purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost
    method and includes treasury stock as a component of
    Shareholders’ equity.

Other
    (Charges) Gains, Net

Other (charges) gains, net includes provisions for restructuring
    and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal course
    of operations. Restructuring provisions represent costs related
    to severance and other benefit programs related to major
    activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign the business
    operations, as well as costs incurred in connection with
    decisions to exit non-strategic businesses. These measures are
    based on formal management decisions, establishment of
    agreements with employees’ representatives or individual
    agreements with affected employees, as well as the public
    announcement of the restructuring plan. The related reserves
    reflect certain estimates, including those pertaining to
    separation costs, settlements of contractual obligations and
    other closure costs. The Company reassesses the reserve
    requirements to complete each individual plan under existing
    restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period.
    Actual experience may be different from these estimates.

These charges were offset by $5 million of income related
    to insurance recoveries associated with plumbing cases.


In connection with the completion of the initial public offering
    in January 2005, the parties amended and restated the
    transaction and monitoring fee agreement to terminate the
    monitoring services and all obligations to pay future monitoring
    fees and paid the Advisor $35 million, which is included in
    Other (charges) gains, net in the table above. In addition, the
    Company also paid $10 million to the Advisor for the 2005
    monitoring fee, which is included in Selling, general and
    administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of
    operations (see Note 27).

Asset impairments in 2005 primarily relate to the Company’s
    decision to divest its COC business (see Note 5).

Other (charges) gains, net also includes charges related to a
    change in environmental remediation strategy related to the
    closure of the Edmonton methanol plant, as well as severance

Income tax provision




(1)

Includes impact of earnings from China and Singapore subject to
    tax holidays which expire between 2008 and 2013.

Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on
    accumulated but undistributed earnings of $2 billion as of
    December 31, 2007, as such earnings have been permanently
    reinvested in the business. The determination of the amount of
    the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the
    undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 was 25% compared to 39% for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate for
    2007 was favorably impacted by (1) an increase in
    unrepatriated low-taxed earnings, including tax holidays, and
    (2) the tax benefit related to German Tax Reform recorded
    during the year ended December 31, 2007. These benefits are
    partially offset by the accounting treatment of recent tax law
    changes in Mexico.

The Company operates under tax holidays in various countries
    which are effective through December 2013. In China, one of the
    Company’s entities has a tax holiday that provides for a
    zero percent tax rate in 2007 and 2008. For 2009 through 2011,
    the Company’s tax rate will be 50% of the statutory rate,
    or 12.5% based on the 2008 statutory rate of 25%. In Singapore,
    one of the Company’s entities has a tax holiday that
    provides for a zero percent tax rate through 2010. For 2011
    through 2013, the Company’s tax rate will be 50% of the
    statutory rate, or 9% based on the current statutory rate of
    18%. The impact of these tax holidays decreased foreign taxes
    $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

The Corporate Tax Reform Act of 2008 was signed by the German
    Federal President in August 2007. The Act reduced the
    Company’s combined corporate statutory tax rate from 40% to
    30% while imposing limitations on the deductibility of certain
    expenses, including interest expense. The Company recognized a
    tax benefit of approximately $39 million related to the
    statutory rate reduction on its German net deferred tax
    liabilities.

Mexico enacted the 2008 Fiscal Reform Bill on October 1,
    2007. Effective January 1, 2008, the bill repealed the
    existing asset-based tax and established a dual income tax
    system consisting of a new minimum flat tax (the
    “IETU”) and the existing regular income tax system.
    The IETU system taxes companies on cash basis net income,
    consisting only of certain specified items of revenue and
    expense, at a rate of 16.5%, 17% and 17.5% for 2008, 2009 and
    2010 forward, respectively. In general, companies must pay the
    higher of the income tax or the IETU, although unlike the
    previous asset tax, the IETU is not creditable against future
    income tax liabilities. The Company has

F-48

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determined that it will primarily be subject to the IETU in
    future periods, and as such it has recorded tax expense of
    approximately $20 million in 2007 for the deferred tax
    effects of the new IETU system.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had US federal net
    operating loss carryforwards of approximately $206 million
    which will begin to expire in 2023. Of this amount,
    $47 million relates to the pre-acquisition period and is
    subject to limitation. The remaining $159 million is
    subject to limitation as a result of the change in stock
    ownership in May 2006. This limitation is not expected to have a
    material impact on utilization of the net operating loss
    carryforwards.

The Company also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards as
    of December 31, 2007 of approximately $564 million for
    Canada, Germany, Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions with
    various expiration dates. Net operating losses in Canada have
    various carryforward periods and began expiring in 2007. Net
    operating losses in Germany have no expiration date. Net
    operating losses in Mexico have a ten year carryforward period
    and begin to expire in 2009. However, these losses are not
    available for use under the new IETU tax regulations in Mexico.
    As the IETU is the primary system upon which the Company will be
    subject to tax in future periods, no deferred tax asset has been
    reflected in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 for
    these income tax loss carryforwards.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective
    January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a
    tax benefit is required to meet before being recognized in the
    financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
    the Company increased Retained earnings by $14 million and
    decreased Goodwill by $2 million. In addition, certain tax
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, as well as related
    potential penalties and interest, were reclassified from current
    liabilities to long-term liabilities. Liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 relate to
    various US and foreign jurisdictions.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $200 million
    as of December 31, 2007 is $56 million of tax benefits
    that, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective
    tax rate.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As
    of December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded a liability
    of approximately $36 million for interest and penalties.
    This amount includes an increase of approximately
    $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

The Company operates in the United States (including multiple
    state jurisdictions), Germany and approximately 40 other foreign
    jurisdictions including Canada, China, France, Mexico and
    Singapore. Examinations are ongoing in a number of those
    jurisdictions including, most significantly, in Germany for the
    years 2001 to 2004. During the quarter ended March 31,
    2007, the Company received final assessments in Germany for the
    prior examination period, 1997 to 2000. The effective settlement
    of those examinations resulted in a reduction to Goodwill of
    approximately $42 million with a net expected cash outlay
    of $29 million. The Company’s

US federal income tax returns for 2003 and beyond are open tax

    are not expected to change significantly over the next
    12 months.

The tax expense (benefit) amounts allocated to other
    comprehensive income (loss), net, was $10 million,
    $11 million and $(21) million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. Of these
    amounts, $10 million, $11 million and
    $(19) million were attributable to the pension and
    postretirement benefits component of other comprehensive income
    (loss), net. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    remaining $(2) million tax benefit was attributable to the
    unrealized gain (loss) on derivative contracts component of
    other comprehensive income (loss), net. The income tax (benefit)
    expense associated with Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net is dependent upon the tax jurisdiction in which the
    items arise and accordingly could result in an effective tax
    rate that is different from the overall consolidated effective
    income tax rate on the consolidated statement of operations.

Stock-Based
    and Other Management Compensation Plans

In December 2004, the Company approved a stock incentive plan
    for executive officers, key employees and directors, a deferred
    compensation plan for executive officers and key employees as
    well as other management incentive programs.

The stock incentive plan allows for the issuance or delivery of
    up to 16,250,000 shares of the Company’s Series A
    common stock through the award of stock options, restricted
    stock units (“RSUs”) and other

stock-based

awards as may be approved by the Company’s Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors.

Deferred
    compensation

The 2004 deferred compensation plan provides an aggregate
    maximum amount payable of $196 million. The initial
    component of the deferred compensation plan vested in 2004 and
    was paid in the first quarter of 2005. The amount payable under
    the deferred compensation plan is subject to downward adjustment
    if the price of the Company’s Series A common stock
    falls below the initial public offering price of $16 per share
    and vests subject to both (1) continued employment or the
    achievement of certain performance criteria and (2) the
    disposition by three of the four Original Shareholders of at
    least 90% of their equity interest in the Company with at least
    a 25% cash internal rate of return on their equity interest (an
    “Exit Event”). In May 2007, the Original Shareholders
    sold their remaining equity interest in the Company (see
    Note 18) triggering an Exit Event. Cash compensation
    of approximately $74 million, representing the
    participants’ 2005 and 2006 contingent benefits, was paid
    to the participants during the year ended December 31,
    2007. Participants continuing in the 2004 deferred compensation
    plan (see below for discussion regarding certain
    participant’s decision to participate in a revised program)
    will continue to vest in their 2007, 2008 and 2009 time-based
    and performance-based entitlements as defined in the deferred
    compensation plan. During the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded compensation expense
    of $84 million, $19 million and $1 million,
    respectively, associated with this plan. The maximum remaining
    amount payable to participants who did not elect to participate
    in the revised program as of December 31, 2007 is
    $13 million, of which $9 million is accrued as of
    December 31, 2007.

On April 2, 2007, certain participants in the
    Company’s deferred compensation plan elected to participate
    in a revised program, which includes both cash awards and
    restricted stock units (see Restricted Stock Units below). Under
    the revised program, participants relinquished their cash awards
    of up to $30 million that would have contingently accrued

under the original plan. In lieu of these awards, the revised
    deferred compensation program provides for a future cash award
    in an amount equal to 90% of the maximum potential payout under
    the original plan, plus growth pursuant to one of three
    participant-selected notional investment vehicles, as defined in
    the associated agreements. Participants must remain employed
    through 2010 to vest in the new award. The Company will make
    award payments under the revised program in the first quarter of
    2011, unless participants elect to further defer the payment of
    their individual awards. Based on current participation in the

revised program, the awards, which will be expensed between
    April 2, 2007 and December 31, 2010, aggregate to
    approximately $27 million plus notional earnings. The
    Company expensed approximately $6 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2007 related to the revised program.

In December 2007, the Company adopted a deferred compensation
    plan whereby certain of the Company’s senior employees and
    directors were offered the opportunity to defer a portion of
    their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal
    to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts based upon the
    market-performance of specified measurement funds selected by
    the participant. Participants were required to make deferral
    elections under the plan in December 2007, and such deferrals
    will be withheld from their compensation during the year ending
    December 31, 2008. This plan became effective on
    January 1, 2008.

Long-term
    incentive plan

Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted a long-term
    incentive plan (the “LTIP Plan”) which covers certain
    members of management and other key employees of the Company.
    The LTIP Plan is a three-year cash based plan in which awards
    are based on annual and three-year cumulative targets (as
    defined in the LTIP Plan). On February 16, 2007,
    approximately $26 million was paid to the LTIP plan
    participants. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company recorded expense of $19 million and
    $5 million, respectively, related to the LTIP Plan. There
    are no additional amounts due under the LTIP Plan.

Stock-based
    compensation

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan that makes
    awards of stock options to certain employees. Prior to
    January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for awards granted
    under this plan using the intrinsic value method of expense
    recognition, which follows the recognition and measurement
    principles of APB No. 25 and related interpretations.
    Compensation cost, if any, was recorded based on the excess of
    the quoted market price at grant date over the amount an
    employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under the provisions of
    APB No. 25, there was no compensation expense resulting
    from the issuance of the stock options as the exercise price was
    equivalent to the fair market value at the date of grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The
    Company elected the modified prospective transition method as
    permitted by SFAS No. 123(R) and, accordingly, prior
    periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Under this transition method,
    compensation cost recognized for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 includes: (i) compensation
    cost for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
    vested as of, January 1, 2006 (based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 and previously presented in the pro forma
    footnote disclosures), and (ii) compensation cost for all
    stock-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006
    (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the new provisions of SFAS No. 123(R)).

It is the Company’s current policy to grant options with an
    exercise price equal to the average of the high and low price of
    the Company’s Series A common stock on the grant date.
    The options issued have a ten-year term with vesting terms
    pursuant to a schedule, with all vesting to occur no later than
    the eighth anniversary of the date of the grant. Accelerated
    vesting for certain awards depends on meeting specified
    performance targets. The estimated value of the Company’s
    stock-based awards less expected forfeitures is amortized over
    the awards’ respective vesting period on the applicable
    graded or straight-line basis, subject to acceleration as
    discussed above.

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date
    of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The
    weighted average assumptions used in the model are outlined in

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on
    historical volatilities and volatilities of peer companies. When
    establishing the expected life assumptions, the Company reviews
    annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants
    with similar vesting periods and the expected life assumptions
    of peer companies. The Company utilized the review of peer
    companies based on its own lack of extensive history.

    related to stock options, excluding estimated forfeitures, to be
    recognized over the remaining vesting periods of the options.
    Cash received from stock option exercises was approximately

Participants in the revised deferred compensation program also
    received an award of RSUs. The RSUs, which were granted on
    April 2, 2007, generally cliff vest on December 31,
    2010 and have a fair value of $23.63 per unit. The number of
    RSUs that ultimately vest depends on market performance targets
    measured by comparison of the Company’s stock performance
    versus a defined peer group. The ultimate award will range from
    zero to 263,030 RSUs, based on the market performance
    measurement at the cliff vesting date. The market performance
    feature is factored into the estimated fair value per unit, and
    compensation expense for the award is based on the maximum RSUs
    of 263,030. Dividends on RSUs are earned in accordance with the
    Company’s common stock dividend policy (see
    Note 18) and are reinvested in additional RSUs.

In addition to the RSUs granted to participants in the revised
    deferred compensation program, the Company granted RSUs to
    certain employees during 2007 with a weighted average fair value
    of $21.30 per unit. The RSUs generally vest annually in equal
    tranches beginning September 30, 2008 through
    September 30, 2011. The RSUs contain the same market
    performance criteria as those described above, with an ultimate
    award that will range from zero to 947,361 RSUs. The awards
    include a

catch-up

provision that provides for vesting on September 30, 2012
    of previously unvested amounts, subject to certain maximums.

The Company also granted 26,070 RSUs to its non-management Board
    of Directors with a fair value of $32.61 per unit, which was
    equal to the price of the Company’s Series A common
    stock on the grant date. During the second quarter of 2007, two
    directors resigned from the board and forfeited a total of 5,214
    RSUs. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company granted
    2,126 RSUs with a fair value of $39.99 per unit to a newly
    appointed member of the Board of Directors. The Director RSUs
    will vest on April 26, 2008.

Fair value for the Company’s RSUs (excluding Director RSUs)
    was estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo Simulation
    approach. Monte Carlo Simulation was utilized to randomly
    generate future stock returns for the Company and each company
    in the peer group based on company-specific dividend yields,
    volatilities and stock return correlations. These returns were
    used to calculate future RSU vesting percentages and the
    simulated values of the vested RSUs were then discounted to
    present value using a risk-free rate, yielding the expected
    value of these RSUs.

Financial
    Instruments

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the Company’s
    variable rate debt, the Company utilizes interest rate swap
    agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate debt to a
    fixed rate obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are
    designated as cash flow hedges. If an interest rate swap
    agreement is terminated prior to its maturity, the amount
    previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net is recognized into earnings over the period that the
    hedged transaction impacts earnings. If the hedging relationship
    is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted
    transaction will not occur according to the original strategy,
    any related amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net are recognized into earnings
    immediately.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had an interest rate
    swap agreement in place with a notional value of
    $300 million. On March 29, 2007, in connection with
    the April 2, 2007 debt refinancing, the Company terminated
    this interest rate swap agreement and recognized a gain of
    $2 million related to amounts previously recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.

In March 2007, in anticipation of the April 2, 2007 debt
    refinancing, the Company entered into various US dollar and Euro
    interest rate swap agreements, which became effective on
    April 2, 2007, with notional amounts of $1.6 billion
    and €150 million, respectively. These swaps remained
    outstanding as of December 31, 2007. Effective
    January 2, 2008, the notional amount of the
    $1.6 billion US dollar swap will decrease by
    $400 million. On November 16, 2007, the Company
    entered into an additional US dollar interest rate swap with a
    notional amount of $400 million, which became effective on
    January 2, 2008.

The Company recognized interest (expense) income from hedging
    activities relating to interest rate swaps of $6 million,
    $1 million and $(3) million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
    recorded a net loss of less than $1 million in Other income
    (expense), net for the ineffective portion of the interest rate
    swap agreements for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    Company recorded a net loss of less than $1 million in
    Other income (expense), net for the ineffective portion of the
    interest rate swap agreements for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. Of the unrealized gains and
    losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net, a net gain of less than $1 million is expected
    to be reclassified into net income in 2008. However, if the
    three month US dollar LIBOR or 3 month EURIBOR declines in
    2008, the Company would expect a net loss.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

Certain entities have receivables and payables denominated in
    currencies other than their respective functional currencies,
    which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into
    foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize its exposure to
    foreign currency fluctuations. The currently outstanding foreign
    currency contracts are hedging booked exposure, however the
    Company may from time to time hedge its currency exposure
    related to forecasted earnings.

To hedge these exposures arising from foreign currency payables
    and receivables, the Company has foreign currency contracts with
    notional amounts totaling approximately $1,856 million and
    $713 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which are predominantly in Euro, US dollars,
    British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Chinese Yuan and Canadian
    dollars. The Company recognizes net foreign currency transaction
    gains or losses on the underlying transactions, which are offset
    by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward
    contracts.

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
    a foreign operation, the Company entered into cross currency
    swaps with certain financial institutions in 2004. Under the
    terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, the Company pays
    approximately €13 million in interest and receives
    approximately $16 million in

F-55

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

interest on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Upon maturity
    of the cross currency swap agreement in June 2008, the Company
    will pay approximately €276 million and receive
    approximately $333 million. These cross currency swaps and
    the Company’s senior Euro term loan are designated as a
    hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company
    dedesignated the net investment hedge due to the debt
    refinancing in April 2007 and redesignated the cross currency
    swaps and new senior EURO term loan in July 2007. As a result,
    the Company recorded approximately $26 million of
    mark-to-market losses related to the cross currency swaps and
    the new senior Euro term loan during this period.

The effective portion of the gain (loss) on the derivative
    (cross currency swaps) and the foreign currency gain (loss) on
    the non-derivative financial instruments is recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net. For the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the amount
    charged to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    was $(19) million, $(23) million and $30 million,
    respectively. The gain (loss) related to items excluded from the
    assessment of hedge effectiveness of the cross currency swap is
    recorded in Other income (expense), net. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the amount charged to
    Other income (expense), net was $(6) million,
    $5 million and $3 million, respectively.

Commodity
    Risk Management

The Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its
    procurement of certain raw materials. The Company manages its
    exposure primarily through the use of long-term supply
    agreements and derivative instruments. The Company regularly
    assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity
    requirements forward and utilization of other raw material
    hedging instruments, in addition to forward purchase contracts,
    in accordance with changes in market conditions. Forward
    purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally
    settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity. For
    qualifying contracts, the Company has elected to apply the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception of
    SFAS No. 133 as it was probable at the inception and
    throughout the term of the contract that they would not settle
    net and would result in physical delivery. As such, realized
    gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of
    the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

In addition, the Company occasionally enters into financial
    derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy
    source. Typically, these types of transactions do not qualify
    for hedge accounting. These instruments are marked to market at
    each reporting period and gains (losses) are included in Cost of
    sales. The Company recognized less than $1 million from
    these types of contracts during each of the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. As of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any open commodity
    financial derivative contracts.

    nature of these instruments. These items have been excluded from
    the table. Additionally, certain long-term receivables,
    principally insurance recoverables, are carried at net
    realizable value (see Note 24).

    than the fair value.

The fair value of long-term debt and debt-related financial
    instruments is based upon the valuations from third-party banks
    and market quotations.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of
    business, relating to such matters as product liability,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices and release of
    chemicals into the environment. While it is impossible at this
    time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these
    proceedings, lawsuits and claims, the Company believes, based on
    the advice of legal counsel, that adequate provisions have been
    made and that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material
    adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but may
    have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or
    cash flows in any given accounting period.

Plumbing
    Actions

CNA Holdings, Inc. (“CNA Holdings”), a US subsidiary
    of the Company, which included the US business now conducted by
    the Ticona business and which is included in the Advanced
    Engineered Materials segment, along with Shell Oil Company
    (“Shell”), E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company
    (“DuPont”) and others, has been a defendant in a
    series of lawsuits, including a number of class actions,
    alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were
    utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential
    property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail.
    Based on, among other things, the findings of outside experts
    and the successful use of

F-57

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Ticona’s acetal copolymer in similar applications, CNA
    Holdings does not believe Ticona’s acetal copolymer was
    defective or caused the plumbing systems to fail. In many cases
    CNA Holdings’ exposure may be limited by invocation of the
    statute of limitations since CNA Holdings ceased selling the
    resin for use in the plumbing systems in site-built homes during
    1986 and in manufactured homes during 1990.

CNA Holdings has been named a defendant in ten putative class
    actions, as well as a defendant in other non-class actions filed
    in ten states, the US Virgin Islands and Canada. In these
    actions, the plaintiffs typically have sought recovery for
    alleged property damages and, in some cases, additional damages
    under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act or similar type
    statutes. Damage amounts have not been specified.

In November 1995, CNA Holdings, DuPont and Shell entered into
    national class action settlements, which have been approved by
    the courts. The settlements call for the replacement of plumbing
    systems of claimants who have had qualifying leaks, as well as
    reimbursements for certain leak damage. Furthermore, the three
    companies had agreed to fund these replacements and
    reimbursements up to $950 million. As of December 31,
    2007, the aggregate funding is $1,103 million due to
    additional contributions and funding commitments made primarily
    by other parties. There are additional pending lawsuits in
    approximately ten jurisdictions, not covered by this settlement;
    however, these cases do not involve (either individually or in
    the aggregate) a large number of homes, and the Company does not
    expect the obligations arising from these lawsuits to have a
    material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In addition, a lawsuit filed in November 1989 in Delaware
    Chancery Court, between CNA Holdings and various of its
    insurance companies relating to all claims incurred and to be
    incurred for the product liability exposure led to a partial
    declaratory judgment in CNA Holdings’ favor.

CNA Holdings has accrued its best estimate of its share of the
    plumbing actions. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company has remaining accruals of $65 million and
    $66 million, respectively, of which $3 million and
    $4 million, respectively, is included in Other current
    liabilities. The Company believes that the plumbing actions are
    adequately provided for in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements and that the plumbing actions will not have
    a material adverse effect on its financial position. However, if
    the Company were to incur an additional charge for this matter,
    such a charge would not be expected to have a material adverse
    effect on its financial position, but may have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
    cash flows in any given accounting period. The Company
    continuously monitors this matter and assesses the adequacy of
    this reserve.

The Company reached settlements with CNA Holdings’ insurers
    specifying their responsibility for these claims. During the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the Company received
    $23 million of insurance proceeds from various CNA
    Holdings’ insurers as full satisfaction for their
    responsibility for these claims.

Plumbing
    Insurance Indemnifications

CAG entered into agreements with insurance companies related to
    product liability settlements associated with
    Celcon

plumbing claims. These agreements, except those with insolvent
    insurance companies, require the Company to indemnify

and/or

defend these insurance companies in the event that third parties
    seek additional monies for matters released in these agreements.
    The indemnifications in these agreements do not provide for time
    limitations.

In certain of the agreements, CAG received a fixed settlement
    amount. The indemnities under these agreements generally are
    limited to, but in some cases are greater than, the amount
    received in settlement from the insurance company. The maximum
    exposure under these indemnifications is $95 million. Other
    settlement agreements have no stated limits.

There are other agreements whereby the settling insurer agreed
    to pay a fixed percentage of claims that relate to that
    insurer’s policies. The Company has provided
    indemnifications to the insurers for amounts paid in excess of
    the settlement percentage. These indemnifications do not provide
    for monetary or time limitations.

Sorbates
    Antitrust Actions

In May 2002, the European Commission informed Hoechst of its
    intent to investigate officially the sorbates industry. In early
    January 2003, the European Commission served Hoechst, Nutrinova,
    Inc., a US subsidiary of Nutrinova Nutrition
    Specialties & Food Ingredients GmbH, previously a
    wholly owned subsidiary of Hoechst, and a number of competitors
    with a statement of objections alleging unlawful,
    anticompetitive behavior affecting the European sorbates market.
    In October 2003, the European Commission ruled that Hoechst,
    Chisso Corporation, Daicel, The Nippon Synthetic Chemical
    Industry Co. Ltd. and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd. operated
    a cartel in the European sorbates market between 1979 and 1996.
    The European Commission imposed a total fine of
    €138 million, of which €99 million was
    assessed against Hoechst, and its legal successors. The case
    against Nutrinova was closed. The fine against Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, is based on the European Commission’s
    finding that Hoechst does not qualify under the leniency policy,
    is a repeat violator and, together with Daicel, was a
    co-conspirator. In Hoechst’s favor, the European Commission
    gave a discount for cooperating in the investigation. Hoechst
    appealed the European Commission’s decision in December
    2003, and that appeal is still pending.

In addition, several civil antitrust actions by sorbates
    customers, seeking monetary damages and other relief for alleged
    conduct involving the sorbates industry, have been filed in US
    state and federal courts naming Hoechst, Nutrinova, and the
    Company’s other subsidiaries, as well as other sorbates
    manufacturers, as defendants. These actions have all been either
    settled or dismissed. The only other private action previously
    pending,

Freeman v. Daicel et al.

, had been
    dismissed. The plaintiffs lost their appeal to the Supreme Court
    of Tennessee in August 2005 and have since filed a motion for
    leave.

In July 2001, Hoechst and Nutrinova entered into an agreement
    with the Attorneys General of 33 states, pursuant to which
    the statutes of limitations were tolled pending the states’
    investigations. This agreement expired in July 2003. Since
    October 2002, the Attorneys General for New York, Illinois,
    Ohio, Nevada, Utah and Idaho filed suit on behalf of indirect
    purchasers in their respective states. The Utah, Nevada and
    Idaho actions have been dismissed as to Hoechst, Nutrinova and
    the Company. A motion for reconsideration is pending in Nevada.
    The Ohio and Illinois actions have been settled and the Idaho
    action was dismissed in February 2005. The New York action,

New York v. Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd., et al.

which was pending in the New York State Supreme Court, New
    York County was dismissed in August 2005. The New York Attorney
    General appealed the decision to dismiss the case, which is
    currently pending.

Based on the advice of external counsel and a review of the
    existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates
    antitrust matters, including the status of government
    investigations, as well as civil claims filed and settled, the
    Company has remaining accruals as of December 31, 2007 of
    $170 million, included in Other current liabilities. As of
    December 31, 2006, the accrual was $148 million. The
    change in the accrual amounts is primarily due to fluctuations
    in the currency exchange rate between the US dollar and the
    Euro. Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted
    with certainty, the Company’s best estimate of the range of
    possible additional future losses and fines (in excess of
    amounts already accrued), including any that may result from the
    above noted governmental proceedings, as of December 31,
    2007 is between $0 million and $9 million. The
    estimated range of such possible future losses is based on the
    advice of external counsel taking into consideration potential
    fines and claims, both civil and criminal that may be imposed or
    made in other jurisdictions.

Pursuant to the Demerger Agreement with Hoechst, CAG was
    assigned the obligation related to the sorbates antitrust
    matter. However, Hoechst, and its legal successors, agreed to
    indemnify CAG for 80% of any costs CAG may incur relative to
    this matter. Accordingly, CAG has recognized a receivable from
    Hoechst and a corresponding contribution of capital, net of tax,
    from this indemnification. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Company has receivables, recorded within current Other
    assets, relating to the sorbates indemnification from Hoechst
    totaling $137 million and $118 million, respectively.
    The Company believes that any resulting liabilities, net of
    amounts recoverable from Hoechst, and its legal successors, will
    not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its

F-59

financial position, but may have a material adverse effect on
    the results of operations or cash flows in any given period.

Acetic
    Acid Patent Infringement Matters

Celanese International Corporation v. China
    Petrochemical Development Corporation — Taiwan
    Kaohsiung District Court.

On May 9, 1999,
    Celanese International Corporation filed a private criminal
    action for patent infringement against China Petrochemical
    Development Corporation, or CPDC, alleging that CPDC infringed
    Celanese International Corporation’s patent covering the
    manufacture of acetic acid. Celanese International Corporation
    also filed a supplementary civil brief which, in view of changes
    in Taiwanese patent laws, was subsequently converted to a civil
    action alleging damages against CPDC based on a period of
    infringement of ten years,

1991-2000,

and based on CPDC’s own data and as reported to the
    Taiwanese securities and exchange commission. Celanese
    International Corporation’s patent was held valid by the
    Taiwanese patent office. On August 31, 2005 a Taiwanese
    court held that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s acetic acid patent and awarded Celanese
    International Corporation approximately $28 million (plus
    interest of $10 million) for the period of 1995 through
    1999. The judgment has been appealed. The Company will not
    record income associated with this favorable judgment until cash
    is received. CPDC has recently filed three patent cancellation
    actions seeking decisions to revoke the patents that are at
    issue in the litigation. The Company believes that these actions
    are without merit and intends to vigorously oppose such actions.

Shareholder
    Litigation

The amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement may be
    increased in special award proceedings initiated by minority
    shareholders, which may further reduce the funds the Purchaser
    can otherwise make available to the Company. As of
    March 30, 2005, several minority shareholders of CAG had
    initiated special award proceedings seeking the court’s
    review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the
    guaranteed annual payment offered under the Domination
    Agreement. As a result of these proceedings, the amount of the
    fair cash consideration and the guaranteed annual payment
    offered under the Domination Agreement could be increased by the
    court so that all minority shareholders, including those who
    have already tendered their shares into the mandatory offer and
    have received the fair cash compensation could claim the
    respective higher amounts. The court dismissed all of these
    proceedings in March 2005 on the grounds of inadmissibility.
    Thirty-three plaintiffs appealed the dismissal, and in January
    2006, twenty-three of these appeals were granted by the court.
    They were remanded back to the court of first instance, where
    the valuation will be further reviewed. On December 12,
    2006, the court of first instance appointed an expert to help
    determine the value of CAG.

The Company received applications for the commencement of award
    proceedings filed by 79 shareholders against the Purchaser
    with the Frankfurt District Court requesting the court to set a
    higher amount for the Squeeze-Out compensation. The motions are
    based on various alleged shortcomings and mistakes in the
    valuation of CAG done for purposes of the Squeeze-Out. On
    May 11, 2007, the court of first instance appointed a
    common representative for those shareholders that have not filed
    an application on their own.

The shareholders’ resolution approving the Squeeze-Out
    passed at the shareholders’ meeting on May 30, 2006
    was challenged in June 2006 by seventeen actions to set aside
    such resolution. In addition, a null and void action was served
    upon CAG in November 2006. The Squeeze-Out, required
    registration in the commercial register and such registration
    was not possible while the lawsuits were pending. Therefore, CAG
    initiated fast track release proceedings asking the court to
    find that the lawsuits did not prevent registration of the
    Squeeze-Out. The court of first instance granted the motion
    regarding the actions to set aside the shareholders’
    resolution in a ruling dated October 10, 2006 that was
    appealed by plaintiff shareholders. In a ruling dated
    November 30, 2006, the court of first instance also granted
    the motion with respect to the null and void action.

On December 22, 2006, the Purchaser and CAG signed a
    settlement agreement with the plaintiff shareholders challenging
    the shareholders’ resolution approving the Squeeze-Out
    (“Settlement Agreement I”). Pursuant to

F-60

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Settlement Agreement I, the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw
    their actions and to drop their complaints in exchange for the
    Purchaser agreeing to pay the guaranteed annual payment for the
    fiscal year ended on September 30, 2006 to those minority
    shareholders who had not yet requested early payment of such
    dividend and to pay a pro rata share of the guaranteed annual
    payment for the first five months of the fiscal year ending on
    September 30, 2007 to all minority shareholders. The
    Purchaser further agreed to make a donation in the amount of
    €0.5 million to a charity, to introduce, upon request
    by plaintiffs, into the award proceedings regarding the cash
    compensation and the guaranteed annual payment under the
    Domination Agreement the prospectus governing the
    January 20, 2005, listing on the NYSE of the shares of the
    Company and to accord the squeezed-out minority shareholders
    preferential treatment if, within three years after
    effectiveness of the Squeeze-Out, the shares of CAG were to be
    listed on a stock exchange again. As a result of the effective
    registration of the Squeeze-Out in the commercial register in
    Germany in December 2006, the Company acquired the remaining 2%
    of CAG in January 2007.

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties
    for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of
    agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements,
    leases, settlement agreements, and various agreements with
    affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, others do not provide such limitations.

The Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably
    estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims
    that have been brought to its attention (see also Note 17).

These known obligations include the following:

Demerger
    Obligations

The Company has obligations to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, for various liabilities under the Demerger Agreement
    as follows:

•

The Company agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, for environmental liabilities associated with
    contamination arising under 19 divestiture agreements entered
    into by Hoechst prior to the demerger.

The Company’s obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, is subject to the following thresholds:

•

The Company will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors,
    against those liabilities up to €250 million;

•

Hoechst, and its legal successors, will bear those liabilities
    exceeding €250 million, however the Company will
    reimburse Hoechst, and its legal successors, for one-third of
    those liabilities for amounts that exceed €750 million
    in the aggregate.

The aggregate maximum amount of environmental indemnifications
    under the remaining divestiture agreements that provide for
    monetary limits is approximately €750 million. Three
    of the divested agreements do not provide for monetary limits.

Based on the estimate of the probability of loss under this
    indemnification, the Company had reserves of $27 million
    and $33 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, for this contingency. Where the Company is unable
    to reasonably determine the probability of loss or estimate such
    loss under an indemnification, the Company has not recognized
    any related liabilities (see Note 17).

The Company has also undertaken in the Demerger Agreement to
    indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, to the extent that
    Hoechst is required to discharge liabilities, including tax
    liabilities, associated with businesses that were included in
    the demerger where such liabilities were not demerged, due to
    legal restrictions on the transfers of such items. These
    indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time limitations.
    The Company has not provided for any reserves associated with
    this indemnification. The Company has not made any payments to
    Hoechst, and its

F-61

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

legal successors, during the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, in connection with this
    indemnification.

Divestiture
    Obligations

The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify
    third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for
    various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also
    include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust
    and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees
    represent standard contractual terms associated with typical
    divestiture agreements and, other than environmental
    liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the
    Company to any significant risk.

The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and
    facilities, through agreements containing indemnifications or
    guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, ranging from one year to thirty years. The
    aggregate amount of guarantees provided for under these
    agreements is approximately $2.5 billion as of
    December 31, 2007. Other agreements do not provide for any
    monetary or time limitations.

Based on historical claims experience and its knowledge of the
    sites and businesses involved, the Company believes that it is
    adequately reserved for these matters. As of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, the Company has reserves in the aggregate of
    $27 million and $30 million, respectively, for these
    matters.

Polyester
    Staple Antitrust Litigation

CNA Holdings, the successor in interest to Hoechst Celanese
    Corporation (“HCC”), Celanese Americas Corporation and
    CAG (collectively, the “Celanese Entities”) and
    Hoechst, the former parent of HCC, were named as defendants in
    two actions (involving 25 individual participants) filed in
    September 2006 by US purchasers of polyester staple fibers
    manufactured and sold by HCC. The actions allege that the
    defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids
    and allocate customers of polyester staple sold in the United
    States. These actions have been consolidated for pre-trial
    discovery by a Multi-District Litigation Panel in the United
    States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina
    and are styled

In re Polyester Staple Antitrust
    Litigation

, MDL 1516. Already pending in that consolidated
    proceeding are five other actions commenced by five other
    alleged US purchasers of polyester staple fibers manufactured
    and sold by the Celanese Entities, which also allege
    defendants’ participation in the conspiracy.

In 1998, HCC sold its polyester staple business as part of its
    sale of its Film & Fibers Division to KoSa, Inc. In a
    complaint now pending against the Celanese Entities and Hoechst
    in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
    New York, Koch Industries, Inc., KoSa B.V. (“KoSa”),
    Arteva Specialties, S.A.R.L. (“Arteva Specialties”)
    and Arteva Services, S.A.R.L. seek, among other things,
    indemnification under the asset purchase agreement pursuant to
    which KoSa and Arteva Specialties agreed to purchase
    defendants’ polyester business for all damages related to
    the defendants’ participation in, and failure to disclose,
    the alleged conspiracy, or alternatively, rescission of the
    agreement.

The Company does not believe that the Celanese Entities engaged
    in any conduct that should result in liability in these actions.
    However, the outcome of the foregoing actions cannot be
    predicted with certainty. The Company believes that any
    resulting liabilities from an adverse result will not, in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial position, but may have a material adverse effect on
    its results of operations or cash flows in any given period.

Other
    Obligations

The Company is secondarily liable under a lease agreement which
    the Company assigned to a third party. The lease expires on
    April 30, 2012. The lease liability for the period from
    January 1, 2008 to April 30, 2012 is estimated to be
    approximately $34 million.

F-62

CELANESE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has agreed to indemnify various insurance carriers,
    for amounts not in excess of the settlements received, from
    claims made against these carriers subsequent to the settlement.
    The aggregate amount of guarantees under these settlements,
    which is unlimited in term, is approximately $10 million.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the occurrence of
    unpredictable future events, the future costs associated with
    them cannot be determined at this time. However, if the Company
    were to incur additional charges for these matters, such charges
    may have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows of the Company in any given
    accounting period.

Other
    Matters

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    commitments to purchase goods and services over a fixed period
    of time. The Company maintains a number of
    “take-or-pay” contracts for the purchase of raw
    materials and utilities. As of December 31, 2007, there
    were outstanding future commitments of approximately
    $3,156 million under take-or-pay contracts. The Company
    does not expect to incur any losses under these contractual
    arrangements and historically has not incurred any material
    losses related to these contracts. Additionally, as of
    December 31, 2007, there were outstanding commitments
    relating to capital projects of approximately $49 million.

As of December 31, 2007, Celanese Ltd. and/or CNA Holdings,
    Inc., both US subsidiaries of the Company, are defendants in
    approximately 626 asbestos cases. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, 92 new cases were filed against the
    Company, 80 cases were resolved and 33 cases were revised after
    further analysis by outside counsel. Because many of these cases
    involve numerous plaintiffs, the Company is subject to claims
    significantly in excess of the number of actual cases. The
    Company has reserves for defense costs related to claims arising
    from these matters. The Company believes that there is not
    significant exposure related to these matters.

In December 2007, the Company received a one time payment in
    resolution of commercial disputes with a vendor. See
    Note 19 for additional information.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
    recorded a gain of $36 million from the settlement of
    transportation-related antitrust matters. This amount was
    recorded against Cost of sales.

Business
    and Geographical Segments

During 2007, the Company revised its reportable segments to
    reflect a change in how the Company is managed. This change was
    made to drive strategic growth and to group businesses with
    similar dynamics and growth opportunities. The Company also
    changed its internal transfer pricing methodology to generally
    reflect market-based pricing which the Company believes will
    make its results more comparable to its peer companies. The
    Company has restated its reportable segments for all prior
    periods presented to conform to the 2007 presentation.

The revised segments are as follows:

Advanced
    Engineered Materials

This business segment develops, produces and supplies a broad
    portfolio of high performance technical polymers for application
    in automotive and electronics products and in other consumer and
    industrial applications. The primary products of Advanced
    Engineered Materials are polyacetal products (“POM”)
    and UHMW-PE (“GUR”), an ultra-high molecular weight
    polyethylene. POM is used in a broad range of products including
    automotive components, electronics and appliances. GUR is used
    in battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration equipment,
    coatings and medical devices.

Consumer
    Specialties

This business segment consists of the Company’s Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. The Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow and acetate flake,
    which is used in the production of filter products. The
    Nutrinova business produces and sells
    Sunett

®

,
    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates, for the food, beverage and pharmaceuticals
    industries.

Industrial
    Specialties

This business segment includes the Emulsions, PVOH and AT
    Plastics businesses. The Company’s emulsions and PVOH
    products are used in a wide array of applications including
    paints and coatings, adhesives, building and construction, glass
    fiber, textiles and paper. AT Plastics offers a complete line of
    low-density polyethylene and specialty, ethylene vinyl acetate
    resins and compounds. AT Plastics’ products are used in
    many applications including flexible packaging, lamination
    products, hot melt adhesive, medical tubing and automotive parts.

Acetyl
    Intermediates

This business segment produces and supplies acetyl products,
    including acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer, acetic anhydride
    and acetate esters. Acetic acid is a key intermediate chemical
    used in the production of vinyl acetate monomer
    (“VAM”), purified terephthalic acid and acetic
    anhydride. VAM is a key intermediate chemical used in emulsions,
    polyvinyl alcohol, and other acetyl derivatives. These products
    are generally used as starting materials for colorants, paints,
    adhesives, coatings, medicines and more. Other chemicals
    produced in this segment are organic solvents and intermediates
    for pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical products.

Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities such as legal,
    accounting and treasury functions and interest income or expense
    associated with financing activities of the Company, and the
    captive insurance companies.

The segment management reporting and controlling systems are
    based on the same accounting policies as those described in the
    summary of significant accounting policies in Note 3. The
    Company evaluates performance based on operating profit, net
    earnings (loss), cash flows and other measures of financial
    performance reported in accordance with US GAAP.

The Company has agreements with certain affiliates, primarily

    managed by the Company, at variable interest rates governed by
    those agreements.

Upon closing of the Acquisition, the Company entered into a
    transaction and monitoring fee agreement with the Advisor. Under
    the agreement, the Advisor agreed to provide monitoring services
    to the Company for a 12 year period. Also, the Advisor was
    entitled to receive additional compensation for providing
    investment banking or other advisory services provided to the
    Company by the Advisor or any of its affiliates, and
    reimbursement for certain expenses, in connection with any
    acquisition, divestiture, refinancing, recapitalization or
    similar transaction. In connection with the completion of the
    initial public offering, the parties amended and restated the
    transaction and monitoring fee agreement to terminate the
    monitoring services and all obligations to pay future monitoring
    fees and paid the Advisor $35 million. The Company also
    paid $10 million to the Advisor for the 2005 monitoring
    fee. In connection with the Original Shareholder’s sale of
    its remaining shares of Series A common stock in May 2007
    (see Note 18), the transaction based agreement was
    terminated.

    certain Blackstone managed funds that market collateralized loan
    obligations to institutional investors invested an aggregate of
    $50 million in the Company’s term loan under the new
    senior credit agreement. At the time of the debt refinancing,
    Blackstone was considered an affiliate of the Company. As a
    result of the Original Shareholders’ sale of its remaining
    shares of Series A common stock in May 2007, Blackstone is
    no longer an affiliate of the Company.

In connection with the acquisition of Vinamul, the Company paid
    the Advisor a fee of $2 million, which was included in the
    computation of the purchase price for the acquisition. In
    connection with the acquisition of Acetex, the Company paid the
    Advisor an initial fee of $1 million. Additional fees of
    $3 million were paid in August 2005 to the Advisor upon the
    successful completion of this acquisition. In addition, the
    Company has paid the Advisor aggregate fees of approximately
    €3 million (approximately $4 million) in
    connection with the Company’s acquisition of
    5.9 million additional CAG shares in August 2005 (see
    Note 2).

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    made payments to the Advisor of $7 million and
    $0 million, respectively, in accordance with the sponsor
    services agreement dated January 26, 2005, as amended.
    These payments were related primarily to the sale of the oxo
    products and derivatives businesses and the acquisition of APL
    (see Note 5).

    Statement on

Form S-1

    Offering”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and
    Restated Registration Rights Agreement (“Registration
    Rights Agreement”) dated as of January 26, 2005,
    between the Company and the Original Shareholders. Pursuant to

Relocation
    of Ticona Plant in Kelsterbach

On November 29, 2006, the Company reached a settlement with
    the Frankfurt, Germany, Airport (“Fraport”) to
    relocate its Kelsterbach, Germany, business, resolving several
    years of legal disputes related to the planned Frankfurt airport
    expansion. The final settlement agreement was approved by the
    Fraport supervisory board on May 8, 2007 at an
    extraordinary board meeting. The final settlement agreement was
    signed on June 12, 2007. As a result of the settlement, the
    Company will transition Ticona’s operations from
    Kelsterbach to another location in Germany by mid-2011. In July
    2007, the Company announced that it would relocate the
    Kelsterbach, Germany, business to the Hoechst Industrial Park in
    the Rhine Main area. Over a five-year period, Fraport will pay
    Ticona a total of €670 million to offset the costs
    associated with the transition of the business from its current
    location and the closure of the Kelsterbach plant. The payment
    amount was increased by €20 million to

Clear
    Lake, Texas Outage

In May 2007, the Company announced that it had an unplanned
    outage at its Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid facility. At that
    time, the Company originally expected the outage to last until
    the end of May. Upon restart of the facility, additional
    operating issues were identified which necessitated an extension
    of the outage for further, more extensive repairs. In July 2007,
    the Company announced that the further repairs were unsuccessful
    on restart of the unit. All repairs were completed in early
    August 2007 and normal production capacity resumed. During the
    fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded approximately
    $40 million of insurance recoveries from its reinsurers in
    partial satisfaction of claims that the Company made based on
    losses resulting from the outage. These insurances recoveries
    are included in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated
    income statement.
