    fact that they do not relate to matters of a strictly factual or
    historical nature and generally discuss or relate to forecasts,
    estimates or other expectations regarding future events.
    Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “estimate,”
    “anticipate,” “project,” “may,”
    “can,” “could,” “might,”
    “will” and similar expressions identify
    forward-looking statements, including statements that relate to,

We continue to make significant progress toward our stated
    growth objectives and aim to increase the earnings power of our
    portfolio over the near term. We intend to continue to grow the
    earnings power of the business through four key strategic levers:

•

Geographic Growth

—We continue to accelerate growth
    in emerging regions, including Asia. Our integrated chemical
    complex in Nanjing, China, the largest integrated acetyls
    complex in the world, serves as a foundation for our expansion
    in Asia and supports the region’s increasing demand. Our
    strategic affiliates will further accelerate this growth.

    particularly in our Advanced Engineered Materials and Industrial
    Specialties businesses. Advanced Engineered Materials has
    industry-leading polymer technologies used in high performance
    applications and Industrial Specialties provides attractive
    economic solutions for environmentally-sensitive low-VOC
    applications, including paints, coatings and adhesives.
    Innovation and application development strategies in these
    businesses bolster the company’s operating earnings.

•

Productivity

—We have a track record of executing on
    our productivity commitments. Energy reduction, business process
    excellence, manufacturing optimization and other productivity
    initiatives will enable us to offset fixed cost inflation,
    improve our operating performance and fuel reinvestment in our
    businesses. We expect to realize our productivity commitments
    for fixed cost reductions in the near term.

•

Portfolio Enhancements

—We continuously pursue
    opportunities that meet our investment criteria and shift our
    current product base towards technology-focused and specialty
    materials businesses. In December 2009, we completed the
    acquisition of the LFT business of FACT GmbH (Future Advanced
    Composites Technology). We also acquired two product lines,
    Zenite

®

LCP and
    Thermx

®

polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate (“PCT”),
    from DuPont Performance Polymers in May 2010. Through our
    25%-owned strategic venture in Saudi Arabia, known as National
    Methanol Company or “Ibn Sina,” we are also investing
    in a new POM facility in Saudi Arabia to strengthen our
    specialty materials portfolio.

Strategic
    Affiliates

Our equity and cost investments represent an important component
    of our strategy for accelerated growth and expansion of our
    global reach. These investments have provided our core
    businesses with a large presence in Asia and the Middle East,
    and have also contributed significantly to earnings and cash
    flow. These ventures, some of which date back as far as the
    1960s, have sizeable operations and are significant within their
    industries.

Proprietary
    Production Technology and Operating Expertise

Our production of acetyl products employs industry-leading
    proprietary and licensed technologies, including our proprietary
    AOPlus

®

and
    AOPlus

®


    technologies for the production of acetic acid and
    VAntage

®

and VAntage
    Plus

tm

vinyl acetate monomer technology.
    AOPlus

®


    builds on the industry benchmark with the ability to increase
    acetic acid production from our current capacity of
    1.2 million tons per reactor per year to approximately
    1.5 million tons per reactor per year at a fraction of the
    cost of a new facility. This technology is applicable to
    existing and new greenfield units.
    AOPlus

®

enables increased raw material efficiencies, lower operating
    costs and the ability to expand plant capacity with minimal
    investment.
    VAntage

®

and VAntage
    Plus

tm

enable significant increases in production efficiencies, lower
    operating costs and increases in capacity at ten to fifteen
    percent of the cost of building a new plant.

Low
    Cost Producer

Our competitive cost structures are based on production and
    purchasing economies of scale, vertical integration, technical
    expertise and the use of advanced technologies.

Global
    Reach

We own or lease thirty production facilities throughout the
    world, of which three sites are no longer operating as of
    December 31, 2010. We participate in strategic ventures
    which operate eight additional facilities. Our infrastructure of
    manufacturing plants, terminals, warehouses and sales offices
    provides us with a competitive advantage in anticipating and
    meeting the needs of our global and local customers in
    well-established and growing industries, while our geographic
    diversity reduces the potential impact of volatility in any
    individual country or region. We have a strong, growing presence
    in Asia, particularly in China, and we have a defined strategy
    to continue this growth. See Note 25 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements for further information
    regarding our geographic areas.



Business
    Strategies

Our strategic foundation is based on the following three pillars
    which are focused on increasing operating cash flows, improving
    profitability, delivering high return on investments and
    increasing shareholder value:

Business
    Focus

We focus on businesses where we have a clear, sustainable,
    competitive advantage. We continue to optimize our business
    portfolio in order to achieve industry, cost and technology
    leadership while expanding our product mix into higher
    value-added products.

Strategic
    Results

We have created a unique portfolio of technology and specialty
    materials businesses that will enable Celanese to deliver
    sustainable results that yield premier financial performance.
    Our advantaged portfolio is well positioned for sustained
    earnings growth, relatively higher margins, modest earnings
    volatility and high capital return.

Strategic
    Levers

We will deliver earnings growth, further strengthen our
    businesses and increase shareholder value through premier
    execution of our four key strategic earnings growth levers:
    Geographic Growth, Innovation, Productivity and Portfolio
    Enhancements.

Business
    Segments

Advanced
    Engineered Materials

Our Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high performance specialty
    polymers for application in automotive, medical and electronics
    products, as well as other consumer and industrial applications.
    Together with our strategic affiliates, we are a leading
    participant in the global specialty polymers industry. The
    primary products of Advanced Engineered Materials are POM, PPS,
    PBT, LFT,
    GUR

®

and LCP. POM, PPS, PBT and LFT are used in a broad range of
    products including automotive components, medical devices,
    electronics, appliances and industrial applications.
    GUR

®

is used in battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration
    equipment, coatings and medical devices. Primary end uses for
    LCP are electrical and electronics.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ specialty polymers have
    chemical and physical properties enabling them, among other
    things, to withstand elevated temperatures, resist adverse
    chemical interactions with solvents and withstand deformation.
    These products are used in a wide range of performance-demanding
    applications in the automotive and electronics sectors as well
    as in other consumer and industrial goods.

Advanced Engineered Materials works in concert with its
    customers to enable innovations and develop new or enhanced
    products. Advanced Engineered Materials focuses its efforts on
    developing new applications for its product lines, often
    creating custom formulations to satisfy the technical and
    processing requirements of a customer’s applications. For
    example, Advanced Engineered Materials has collaborated with
    fuel system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with the
    chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure
    to hot diesel fuels in the new generation of common rail diesel
    engines. The product can also be used in automotive fuel sender
    units where it remains stable at the operating temperatures
    present in direct-injection diesel engines and can meet the
    requirements of the new generation of biofuels.

Prices for most of these products, particularly specialized
    product grades for targeted applications, generally reflect the
    value added in complex polymer chemistry, precision formulation
    and compounding, and the extensive application development
    services provided. These specialized products are not typically
    susceptible to cyclical swings in pricing.

Customers

Advanced Engineered Materials’ sales in Asia are made
    directly and through distributors including its strategic
    affiliates. Polyplastics, KEPCO and Fortron are accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting and therefore not included
    in Advanced Engineered Materials’ consolidated net sales.
    If Advanced Engineered Materials’ portion of the sales made
    by these strategic affiliates were included in the table above,
    the percentage of sales sold in Asia-Pacific would be
    substantially higher. A number of Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ POM customers, particularly in the appliance,
    electrical components and certain sections of the
    electronics/telecommunications fields, have moved tooling and
    molding operations to Asia, particularly southern China. In
    addition to our Advanced Engineered Materials affiliates, we
    directly service Asian demand by offering our customers global
    solutions.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ principal customers are
    consumer product manufacturers and suppliers to the automotive
    industry. These customers primarily produce engineered products,
    and Advanced Engineered Materials collaborates with its
    customers to assist in developing and improving specialized
    applications and systems. Advanced Engineered Materials has
    long-standing relationships with most of its major customers,
    but also uses distributors for its major products, as well as a
    number of electronic marketplaces to reach a larger customer
    base. For most of Advanced Engineered Materials’ products,
    contracts with customers typically have a term of one to
    two years.

•

Key Products

Acetate flake and tow.

According to the 2009
    Stanford Research Institute International Chemical Economics
    Handbook, as of 2008 we were the world’s leading producer
    of acetate tow (inclusive of the production of our China
    ventures). Acetate tow is used primarily in cigarette filters.
    To produce acetate tow, we first produce acetate flake by
    processing wood pulp with acetic acid and acetic anhydride. Wood
    pulp comes from reforested trees and is purchased externally
    from a variety of sources and acetic anhydride is an
    intermediate chemical we produce internally from acetic acid.
    The acetate flake is then further processed into acetate fiber
    in the form of a tow band.

Sales of acetate tow amounted to approximately 15%, 16% and 12%
    of our consolidated net sales for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

We have an approximate 30% interest in three manufacturing
    ventures in China that produce acetate flake and tow. Our
    partner in each of the ventures is the Chinese state-owned
    tobacco entity, China National Tobacco Corporation. In addition
    to being our venture partner, China National Tobacco accounted
    for approximately 12% of our 2010 acetate tow sales.

Sunett

®

sweetener.

Acesulfame potassium, a high intensity
    sweetener marketed under the trademark
    Sunett

®

,

    is used in a variety of beverages, confections and dairy
    products throughout the world.
    Sunett

®

sweetener is known for its consistent product quality and
    reliable supply. Nutrinova’s strategy is to be the most
    reliable and highest quality producer of this product, to
    develop new product applications and to expand into new regions.

Food protection ingredients.

Nutrinova’s food
    protection ingredients are mainly used in foods, beverages and
    personal care products. The primary raw materials for these
    products are ketene and crotonaldehyde. Sorbates pricing is
    extremely sensitive to demand and industry capacity and is not
    necessarily dependent on the prices of raw materials.

•

Facilities

Acetate Products has production sites in the United States,
    Mexico, the United Kingdom and Belgium, and participates in
    three manufacturing ventures in China. During 2010, we announced
    the shutdown of our acetate tow and flake manufacturing
    operations at our Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom site. We will
    continue to maintain our Clarifoil manufacturing operations at
    this site.

Nutrinova has a production facility in Germany, as well as sales
    and distribution facilities in all major regions of the world.

    our advanced ethanol production process.

•

Key Products

Acetyl Products.

Acetyl products include acetic
    acid, VAM and acetic anhydride. Acetic acid is primarily used to
    manufacture VAM, PTA and other acetyl derivatives. VAM is used
    in a variety of adhesives, paints, films, coatings and textiles.
    Acetic anhydride is a raw material used in the production of
    cellulose acetate, detergents and pharmaceuticals. Acetaldehyde
    is a major feedstock for the production of a variety of
    derivatives, such as pyridines, which are used in agricultural
    products. We manufacture acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride
    for our own use, as well as for sale to third parties.

Our basic acetyl intermediates products, acetic acid and VAM,
    are impacted by global supply and demand fundamentals and are
    cyclical in nature. The principal raw materials in these
    products are: carbon monoxide, which we generally purchase under
    long-term contracts; methanol, which we generally purchase under
    long-term and short-term contracts; and ethylene, which we
    purchase from numerous sources. With the exception of carbon
    monoxide, these raw materials are commodity products available
    from a wide variety of sources.

Our production of acetyl products employs leading proprietary
    and licensed technologies, including our proprietary

    liability and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance
    companies issue insurance policies to our subsidiaries to
    provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the
    insurance market and to lower long-term insurance costs by
    avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory
    fees. The captive insurance companies retain risk at levels
    approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from
    third parties to limit the net risk retained. One of the captive
    insurance companies also insures certain third-party risks.

Strategic
    Ventures & Affiliates

We have a significant portfolio of strategic relationships and
    ventures in various regions, including Asia-Pacific, North
    America, the Middle East and Europe. Historically, we have
    entered into these strategic investments in order to gain access
    to local demand, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas
    we believe have significant future business potential. Depending
    on the level of investment and other factors, we account for our
    strategic ventures using either the equity method or cost method
    of accounting.

In aggregate, our strategic investments generate significant
    sales, earnings and cash flows. For example, during the year
    ended December 31, 2010, our equity affiliates generated
    combined sales of $4.5 billion resulting in
    $168 million of equity in earnings from affiliates during
    the same period.

National Methanol Company (Ibn Sina).

With
    production facilities in Saudi Arabia, Ibn Sina represents
    approximately 2% of the world’s methanol production
    capacity and is one of the world’s largest producers of
    MTBE, a gasoline additive. We indirectly own a 25% interest in
    Ibn Sina through CTE Petrochemicals Company, a



joint venture with Texas Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. Texas
    Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. indirectly owns an additional
    25% interest in Ibn Sina, and the remaining 50% interest is held
    by SABIC. SABIC is responsible for all product marketing.

In April 2010, we announced that Ibn Sina will construct a
    50,000 ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia and that the
    term of the joint venture agreement was extended until 2032. Ibn
    Sina’s existing natural gas supply contract expires in
    2022. The purpose of the plant is to supply POM to support
    Celanese’s Advanced Engineered Materials segment growth as
    well as our venture partners’ regional business
    development. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our
    indirect economic interest in Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to
    32.5%. SABIC’s economic interest will remain unchanged.

In connection with the extension of the venture, we reassessed
    the factors surrounding the accounting method for this
    investment and changed from the cost method of accounting for
    investments to the equity method of accounting for investments
    beginning April 1, 2010.

Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd.

Founded in
    1987, KEPCO is the leading producer of POM in South Korea.
    Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. owns 40% and Mitsubishi
    Corporation owns 10% of KEPCO. KEPCO operates a POM plant in
    Ulsan, South Korea and participates with Polyplastics and
    Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a POM facility in
    Nantong, China.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd.

Polyplastics is a leading
    supplier of engineered plastics in the Asia-Pacific region.
    Polyplastics’ principal production facilities are located
    in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and China. Polyplastics is a producer
    and marketer of POM in the Asia-Pacific region.

Fortron Industries LLC.

Fortron is a leading global
    producer of PPS. Fortron’s facility is located in
    Wilmington, North Carolina.

China acetate strategic ventures.

We hold an
    approximately 30% ownership interest (50% board representation)
    in three separate Acetate Products production entities in China:
    the Nantong, Kunming and Zhuhai Cellulose Fiber Companies. In
    each instance, the Chinese state-owned tobacco entity, China
    National Tobacco Corporation, controls the remainder. With an
    estimated 30% share of the world’s cigarette production and
    consumption, China is the world’s largest and fastest
    growing area for acetate tow products according to the 2009
    Stanford Research Institute International Chemical Economics
    Handbook. Combined, these ventures are a leader in Chinese
    domestic acetate production and are well positioned to supply
    Chinese cigarette producers.

In December 2009, we announced plans with China National Tobacco
    to expand our acetate flake and tow capacity at our Nantong
    facility. During 2010 we received formal approval to expand
    flake and tow capacities, each by 30,000 tons. Our Chinese
    acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash
    flow. We made contributions during 2010 of $12 million and
    have committed to contributions of $17 million in 2011
    related to the capacity expansion in Nantong.

Our Chinese acetate ventures pay a dividend in the second
    quarter of each fiscal year, based on the ventures’
    performance for the preceding year. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
    received cash dividends of $71 million, $56 million
    and $46 million, respectively.

Despite the fact that our ownership interest exceeds 20% in each
    of our China Acetate Products ventures, we account for these
    investments using the cost method of accounting because we
    cannot exercise significant influence over these entities. We
    determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over
    these entities due to local government investment in and
    influence over these entities, limitations on our involvement in
    the

day-to-day

operations and the present inability of the entities to provide
    timely financial information prepared in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
    (“US GAAP”).

Raw
    Materials and Energy

We purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources
    in many countries for use in our production processes. We have a
    policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of
    supply for materials. However, some of our individual plants may
    have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials,
    such as carbon monoxide, steam and acetaldehyde. Although we
    have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials,
    there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not
    affect our raw material supply. Even if we have multiple sources
    of supply for a raw material, there can be no assurance that
    these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier.
    There cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be
    affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of
    supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole
    supplier. In addition, the price of raw materials varies, often
    substantially, from year to year.

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are
    commodities whose prices fluctuate as supply and demand
    fundamentals change. Our production facilities rely largely on
    fuel oil, natural gas, coal and electricity for energy. Most of
    the raw materials for our European operations are centrally
    purchased by one of our subsidiaries, which also buys raw
    materials on behalf of third parties. We manage our exposure to
    commodity risk primarily through the use of long-term supply
    agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and
    forward purchase contracts.

We also currently purchase and lease supplies of various
    precious metals, such as rhodium, used as catalysts for the
    manufacture of Acetyl Intermediates products. For precious
    metals, the leases are distributed between a minimum of three
    lessors per product and are divided into several contracts.

Research
    and Development

All of our businesses conduct research and development
    activities to increase competitiveness. Our businesses are
    innovation-oriented and conduct research and development
    activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production
    technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new
    products and applications. We consider the amounts spent during
    each of the last three fiscal years on research and development
    activities to be sufficient to drive our current strategic
    initiatives.

Intellectual
    Property

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights
    and product designs in order to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Patents
    may cover processes, products, intermediate products and product
    uses. We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means
    of protecting the brand names of our products. We protect our
    intellectual property vigorously against infringement and also
    seek to register design protection where appropriate.

Patents.

In most industrial countries, patent
    protection exists for new substances and formulations, as well
    as for unique applications and production processes. However, we
    do business in regions of the world where intellectual property

Many of our employees are unionized, particularly in Germany,
    Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Belgium. In the
    United States, however, less than one quarter of our employees
    are unionized. Moreover, in Germany and France, wages and
    general working conditions are often the subject of centrally
    negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Within the limits
    established by these agreements, our various subsidiaries
    negotiate directly with the unions and other labor
    organizations, such as workers’ councils, representing the
    employees. Collective bargaining agreements between the German
    chemical employers associations and unions relating to
    remuneration generally have a term of one year, while in the
    United States a three year term for collective bargaining
    agreements is typical. We offer comprehensive benefit plans for
    employees and their families and believe our relations with
    employees are satisfactory.



Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the
    level of future sales activity. In general, we do not
    manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production
    and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders
    as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe
    that backlog information is not material to understanding our
    overall business and should not be considered a reliable
    indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of
    revenue or financial performance.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Many factors could have an effect on our financial condition,
    cash flows and results of operations. We are subject to various
    risks resulting from changing economic, environmental,
    political, industry, business and financial conditions. The
    factors described below represent our principal risks.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

Our
    business is exposed to risks associated with the
    creditworthiness of our suppliers, customers and business
    partners and the industries in which our suppliers and customers
    participate are cyclical in nature, both of which may adversely
    affect our business and results of operations.

Some of the industries in which our end-use customers
    participate, such as the automotive, electrical, construction
    and textile industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a
    risk to us which is beyond our control. The industries in which
    these customers participate are highly competitive, to a large
    extent driven by end-use applications, and may experience
    overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of
    our products. Our business is exposed to risks associated with
    the creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and
    business partners and reductions in demand for our
    customers’ products. The consequences of this could include
    the interruption of production at the facilities of our
    customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer
    orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain
    financing to purchase our products, delays or interruptions of
    the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of
    customers, suppliers or other creditors. The occurrence of any
    of these events may adversely affect our cash flow,
    profitability and financial condition.

We are
    a company with operations around the world and are exposed to
    general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks
    in the countries in which we have significant
    operations.

We operate globally and have customers in many countries. We
    have major facilities primarily located in North America, Europe
    and Asia, and hold interests in ventures that operate in the US,
    Germany, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. Our
    principal customers are similarly global in scope, and the
    prices of our most significant products are typically world
    market prices. Also, our operations in certain foreign
    jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation
    risk, and some of our contractual relationships within these



jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full
    compensation for loss. Consequently, our business and financial
    results are affected, directly and indirectly, by world
    economic, political and regulatory conditions.

In addition to the worldwide economic downturn, conditions such
    as the uncertainties associated with war, terrorist activities,
    civil unrest, epidemics, pandemics, weather, the effects of
    climate change or political instability in any of the countries
    in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses
    in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products, as well
    as increasing security costs, insurance premiums and other
    expenses. These conditions could also result in or lengthen
    economic recession in the United States, Europe, Asia or
    elsewhere.

Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or
    court decisions could expose us to fines, penalties and other
    costs. Moreover, changes in laws or regulations, such as
    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements (including import
    or export licensing requirements), or changes in the reporting
    requirements of the United States, German, European Union
    (“EU”) or Asian governmental agencies, could increase
    the cost of doing business in these regions. Any of these
    conditions may have an effect on our business and financial
    results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future
    prices for our securities, including our stock. Although we
    maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the operation
    of our business, there can be no assurance that the types of
    insurance we obtain or the level of coverage is adequate or that
    we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance
    or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all.

In particular, we have invested significant resources in China
    and other Asian countries. This region’s growth has slowed
    and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated
    with our investment there and our financial results may be
    adversely impacted.

We are
    subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the
    prices and availability of key raw materials and
    energy.

We purchase significant amounts of natural gas, ethylene and
    methanol from third parties for use in our production of basic
    chemicals in the Acetyl Intermediates segment, principally
    acetic acid, VAM and formaldehyde. We use a portion of our
    output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in the production
    of further products in all our business segments. We also
    purchase significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our
    production of cellulose acetate in the Consumer Specialties
    segment. The price of many of these items is dependent on the
    available supply of such item and may increase significantly as
    a result of production disruptions or strikes. In particular, to
    the extent of our vertical integration in the production of
    chemicals, shortages in the availability of raw material
    chemicals, such as natural gas, ethylene and methanol, can have
    an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in
    intermediate and finished products. Such shortages would
    adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and
    increase our costs.

We are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials
    and energy. Although we have agreements providing for the supply
    of natural gas, ethylene, wood pulp, electricity and fuel oil,
    the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary
    with economic conditions and may be highly volatile. Factors
    that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the
    past and which may do so in the future include:

•

Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from
    growing uses or new uses;

•

Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, labor
    disruption or involuntary shutdowns;

•

The general level of business and economic activity; and

•

The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.

If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy
    and raw material costs, or if such commodities were unavailable,
    it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial
    results.



Failure
    to develop new products and production technologies or to
    implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives
    successfully may harm our competitive position.

Our operating results depend significantly on the development of
    commercially viable new products, product grades and
    applications, as well as production technologies. If we are
    unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and
    production processes in the future, our competitive position and
    operating results may be negatively affected. For example, we
    recently announced our intention to construct new ethanol
    manufacturing facilities in China and the US that will utilize
    advanced technology developed with elements of our proprietary
    advanced acetyl platform. However, as we invest in the
    commercialization of this new process technology, we face the
    risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization
    difficulties, including an inability to obtain necessary permits
    or governmental approvals, failure of facilities or processes to
    operate in accordance with specifications or expectations,
    construction delays, cost over-runs, the unavailability of
    required materials and equipment and various other factors.
    Likewise, we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake
    initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and
    performance and to generate cost savings. These initiatives may
    not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings
    from such activities may not be realized.

US
    federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain
    chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be
    proposed in the future could, if passed into law, require us to
    relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to
    alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical
    products, thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Regulations are being implemented by the US Department of
    Homeland Security (“DHS”) aimed at decreasing the
    risk, and effects, of potential terrorist attacks on chemical
    plants located within the United States. Pursuant to these
    regulations, these goals would be accomplished in part through
    the requirement that certain high-priority facilities develop a
    prevention, preparedness, and response plan after conducting a
    vulnerability assessment. In addition, companies may be required
    to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals
    and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and
    security plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in
    order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a
    terrorist attack. We have registered certain of our sites with
    DHS in accordance with these regulations, have conducted
    vulnerability assessments at applicable sites and are awaiting
    DHS review and approval of security plans. Until that is done we
    cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any
    security measures that DHS may require.

Environmental
    regulations and other obligations relating to environmental
    matters could subject us to liability for fines,

clean-ups

and other damages, require us to incur significant costs to
    modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and
    delivery costs.

Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and potential obligations with respect to
    contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our
    operating results. These obligations include the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
    (“CERCLA”) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery
    Act of 1976 (“RCRA”) related to sites currently or
    formerly owned or operated by us, or where waste from our
    operations was disposed. We also have obligations related to the
    indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer
    agreement between Celanese GmbH and Hoechst AG, also referred to
    as the demerger agreement, for environmental matters arising out
    of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger.

Our operations are subject to extensive international, national,
    state, local and other supranational laws and regulations that
    govern environmental and health and safety matters, including
    CERCLA and RCRA. We incur substantial capital and other costs to
    comply with these requirements. If we violate any one of those
    laws or regulations, we can be held liable for substantial fines
    and other sanctions, including limitations on our operations as
    a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits
    involved. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws,
    regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial
    costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and
    could subject our handling, manufacture, transport, use, reuse
    or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous
    scrutiny than at present. One example of such regulations is the
    National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants
    (“NESHAP”) for Industrial, Commercial, and
    Institutional Boilers, which was issued in



draft form by the Environmental Protection Agency
    (“EPA”) on April 29, 2010. In its current draft
    form, these rules could require us to make significant capital
    expenditures to comply with stricter emissions requirements for
    industrial boilers at our facilities. Consequently, compliance
    with these laws and regulations could result in significant
    capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities,
    which could adversely affect our business and cause our
    operating results to be less favorable than expected. An adverse
    outcome in these claim procedures may negatively affect our
    earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period.

Changes
    in environmental, health and safety regulations in the
    jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products could
    lead to a decrease in demand for our products.

New or revised governmental regulations and independent studies
    relating to the effect of our products on health, safety and the
    environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of
    producing our products.

In June 2009, the California Office of Environmental Health
    Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) formally proposed to add
    VAM, along with 11 other substances, to a list of chemicals
    “known to the state of California” to cause cancer.
    OEHHA is required to maintain this list under the Safe Drinking
    Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition
    65”). Celanese filed comments in opposition to the proposed
    listing because the listing was not based on a scientific review
    of the relevant data and the legal standard for adding VAM to
    the Proposition 65 list had not been met. Celanese also filed an
    action in the Sacramento County Superior Court seeking
    declaration that OEHHA’s proposed listing of VAM would be
    contrary to law. The Superior Court granted Celanese’s
    request for relief. An appeal filed by OEHHA is pending in the
    California Court of Appeal.

We can provide no assurance that the Sacramento County Superior
    Court decision will be affirmed on appeal, or that VAM or other
    chemicals we produce will not be classified in other
    jurisdictions in a manner that would adversely affect demand for
    such products.

We are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from
    formaldehyde. Several studies have investigated possible links
    between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including
    leukemia. The International Agency for Research on Cancer
    (“IARC”), a private research agency, has reclassified
    formaldehyde from Group 2A (probable human carcinogen) to Group
    1 (known human carcinogen) based on studies linking formaldehyde
    exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer in humans. In
    October 2009, IARC also concluded based on a recent study that
    there is sufficient evidence for a casual association between
    formaldehyde and the development of leukemia. We expect the
    results of IARC’s review will be examined and considered by
    government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and
    environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements.

Other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological
    testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals,
    including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives
    include the Voluntary Children’s Chemical Evaluation
    Program, High Production Volume Chemical Initiative and expected
    modifications to the Toxic Substances Control Act
    (“TSCA”) in the United States, as well as various
    European Commission programs, such as the Registration,
    Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals
    (“REACh”).

The above-mentioned assessments in the United States and Europe
    may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved
    and additional requirements being placed on the production,
    handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such
    concerns and additional requirements could also increase the
    cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and
    otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a
    decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand
    would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results
    of operations.

Our
    business exposes us to potential product liability claims and
    recalls, which could adversely affect our financial condition
    and performance.

The development, manufacture and sales of specialty chemical
    products by us, including products produced for the food,
    beverage, cigarette, and pharmaceutical industries, involve an
    inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, product
    recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. A
    product liability claim or judgment against



us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures,
    affect consumer or customer confidence in our products, and
    divert management’s attention from other responsibilities.
    Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be
    no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate
    or that we will be able to continue to maintain its existing
    insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost,
    if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely
    uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We are
    subject to risks associated with possible climate change
    legislation, regulation and international accords.

Greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of
    a large amount of international, national, regional, state and
    local attention. Cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse
    gas emissions have been introduced in the EU. Similarly,
    numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in
    the US Congress, which could adversely impact all industries. In
    addition, the EPA has promulgated rules limiting greenhouse gas
    emissions and regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur
    pursuant to future US treaty obligations, statutory or
    regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act or new climate change
    legislation.

While not all are likely to become law, this is a strong
    indication that additional climate change related mandates will
    be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely
    impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material
    prices, establishing costly emissions trading schemes and
    requiring modification of equipment to limit greenhouse gas
    emissions.

A step toward potential federal restriction on greenhouse gas
    emissions was taken on December 7, 2009 when the
    Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued its
    Endangerment Finding in response to a decision of the Supreme
    Court of the United States. The EPA found that the emission of
    six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (which is emitted
    from the combustion of fossil fuels), may reasonably be
    anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this
    finding, the EPA defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases
    to be “air pollution” subject to regulation under the
    Clean Air Act. Although the EPA has stated a preference that
    greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation
    rather than the existing Clean Air Act, absent legislative
    action, the EPA has begun to regulate many sources of greenhouse
    gas emissions.

For example, on January 2, 2011, many large sources of
    greenhouse gas emissions became subject to the requirements of
    the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”)
    permitting program. The PSD permitting program requires these
    large sources of greenhouse gas emissions to install Best
    Available Control Technology (“BACT”) to limit
    greenhouse gas emissions when modifying equipment if the
    increased greenhouse gas emissions will exceed 75,000 tons per
    year. Texas, however, has refused to implement the PSD
    permitting program for greenhouse gas emissions, which prompted
    the EPA to attempt to take over GHG permitting from the state
    regulators late last year. On December 30, 2010, an
    Appellate Court stayed EPA’s action pending a determination
    of whether EPA’s take-over complies with the
    U.S. Clean Air Act. Additionally, the EPA announced on
    December 23, 2010 that it would impose further greenhouse
    gas emission limits on electric generating units and petroleum
    refineries through the establishment of New Source Performance
    Standards (“NSPS”).

The US Congress recently considered legislation that would
    create an economy-wide

“cap-and-trade”

system that would establish a limit (or cap) on overall
    greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase

and/or

sale
    of emissions permits or “allowances.” Under these
    proposals, the chemical industry likely would be affected due to
    anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel providers pass on
    the cost of the emissions allowances, which they would be
    required to obtain, to cover the emissions from fuel production
    and the eventual use of fuel by the Company or its energy
    suppliers. In addition,

cap-and-trade

proposals would likely increase the cost of energy, including
    purchases of steam and electricity, and certain raw materials
    used by the Company.

Other countries are also considering or have implemented
    regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Future
    environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to
    climate change are possible, which could materially increase
    operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase
    our manufacturing and delivery costs.



Our
    production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and
    hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that
    could have a negative effect on our operating
    results.

Our operations are subject to operating risks associated with
    chemical manufacturing, including the related storage and
    transportation of raw materials, finished products and waste.
    These risks include, among other things, pipeline and storage
    tank leaks and ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or
    releases of toxic or hazardous substances.

These operating risks can cause personal injury, property damage
    and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown
    of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal
    penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt
    production and have a negative effect on the productivity and
    profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our
    operating results and cash flows.

Production
    at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety
    of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our
    products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’
    demands.

A disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing
    facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.
    Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire,
    natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other
    manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation
    interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative
    facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be
    available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant
    time to start production, each of which could negatively affect
    our business and financial performance. If one of our key
    manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for
    an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the
    shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to
    meet our customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek
    other suppliers. In particular, production disruptions at our
    manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs
    in the production of chemicals in other business segments, such
    as acetic acid, VAM and formaldehyde, could have a more
    significant adverse effect on our business and financial
    performance and results of operation to the extent of such
    vertical integration. Furthermore, to the extent a production
    disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been
    operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of
    our product could be particularly harmful because production at
    the manufacturing facility may not be able to be sufficiently
    increased in the future.

Our
    business and financial results may be adversely affected by
    various legal and regulatory proceedings.

We are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and
    claims in the normal course of business and could become subject
    to additional claims in the future, some of which could be
    material. The outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and
    claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of
    litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to
    reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead us to
    change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance
    receivables where applicable, or permit us to make such
    estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable
    estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a
    significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or
    changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement,
    or unfavorable development could result in charges that could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations or financial condition in any particular period. For
    a more detailed discussion of our legal proceedings, see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

below.

Our
    success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key
    employees and the identification and development of talent to
    succeed senior management.

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key
    personnel, and we rely heavily on our management team. The
    inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected
    loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In
    addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our
    future success depends in part on our ability to identify and
    develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of
    key personnel and appropriate senior management succession
    planning will continue to be critically important to the
    successful implementation of our strategies.



We may
    not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully
    integrate future acquisitions into our business, which could
    affect adversely our business or results of
    operations.

As part of our growth strategy, we intend to pursue acquisitions
    and joint venture opportunities. Successful accomplishment of
    this objective may be limited by the availability and
    suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial
    resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity.
    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulty
    determining appropriate valuation, integrating operations,
    technologies, services and products of the acquired lines or
    businesses, personnel turnover and the diversion of
    management’s attention from other business matters. In
    addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from
    these acquisitions in the timeframe that we anticipate, or at
    all, which could affect adversely our business or results of
    operations.

We may
    experience unexpected difficulties and incur unexpected costs in
    the relocation of our Ticona plant from Kelsterbach to the Rhine
    Main area, which may increase our costs, delay the transition or
    disrupt our ability to supply our customers.

We have agreed with Frankfurt, Germany Airport
    (“Fraport”) to relocate our Kelsterbach, Germany
    operations to another location, resolving several years of legal
    disputes related to the planned Frankfurt airport expansion. In
    July 2007, we announced that we would relocate the Kelsterbach,
    Germany operations to the Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine
    Main area. Fraport agreed to pay Ticona a total of
    €670 million over a

5-year

period to offset costs associated with the closure of the
    Kelsterbach plant and the transition of the operations from its
    current location. As the relocation project progressed, we
    decided to expand the scope of the new production facilities and
    now expect to spend in excess of the proceeds to be received
    from Fraport. Because the relocation of our Kelsterbach, Germany
    operations represents a major logistical undertaking, the
    construction of our new facilities may be delayed, actual costs
    may exceed our revised estimates and we may be subject to
    penalties if we have not timely vacated the Kelsterbach
    location. If the relocation causes other unexpected
    difficulties, our costs may increase or supplies to our
    customers may be disrupted.

Our
    significant non-US operations expose us to global exchange rate
    fluctuations that could adversely impact our
    profitability.

Because we conduct a significant portion of our operations
    outside the United States, fluctuations in currencies of other
    countries, especially the Euro, may materially affect our
    operating results. For example, changes in currency exchange
    rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of
    our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets
    and increase the cost of items required in our operations.

A substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in
    currencies other than the US dollar. In our consolidated
    financial statements, we translate our local currency financial
    results into US dollars based on average exchange rates
    prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the
    end of that period. During times of a strengthening US dollar
    our reported international sales, earnings, assets and
    liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will
    translate into fewer US dollars.

In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency
    transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries
    enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a
    currency different from the operating subsidiary’s
    functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we
    may not be able to manage our currency transaction and
    translation risks effectively, and volatility in currency
    exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of
    operations to a significant additional risk. Since a portion of
    our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other
    than US dollars, a weakening of the US dollar could make it more
    difficult for us to repay our indebtedness denominated in
    foreign currencies unless we have cash flows in those foreign
    currencies from our foreign operations sufficient to repay that
    indebtedness out of those cash flows.

We use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to
    foreign currency fluctuations, but we cannot guarantee that our
    hedging strategies will be effective. Failure to effectively
    manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.



Significant
    changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions
    relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the
    valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension
    plans and our pension cost.

The cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of
    time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of
    time. Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan
    assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present
    value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is
    materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension
    obligations, the level and value of plan assets available to
    fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in
    investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of
    invested assets can result in corresponding increases and
    decreases in the valuation of plan assets, particularly equity
    securities, or in a change of the expected or actual rate of
    return on plan assets. A change in the discount rate would
    result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of
    pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our
    pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the
    following fiscal years. In recent years, an extended duration
    strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented to minimize
    the influence of liability volatility due to interest rate
    movements. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan
    assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic
    pension cost for subsequent fiscal years. If the value of our
    pension fund’s portfolio declines we may be required to
    contribute capital in addition to those contributions for which
    we have already planned.

Our future success will depend in part on our ability to
    protect our intellectual property rights. Our inability to
    protect and enforce these rights could reduce our ability to
    maintain our market position and our profit margins.

We attach great importance to our patents, trademarks,
    copyrights and know-how and trade secrets in order to protect
    our investment in research and development, manufacturing and
    marketing. We have also adopted rigorous internal policies for
    protecting our valuable know-how and trade secrets. We sometimes
    license patents and other technology from third parties. Our
    policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant
    developments that provide us competitive advantages in our major
    markets. Patents may cover catalysts, processes, products,
    intermediate products and product uses. These patents provide
    varying periods of protection based on the filing date of the
    patent application, and the legal life of patents, type of
    patent and its scope in the various countries in which we seek
    protection. As patents expire, the catalysts, processes and
    products described and claimed in those patents become generally
    available for use by the public subject to our continued
    protection for associated know-how and trade secrets. We also
    seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting
    the brand names of our products, which brand names become more
    important once the corresponding product or process patents have
    expired. We operate in regions of the world where intellectual
    property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and
    our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions
    with similar challenges. If we are not successful in protecting
    or maintaining our patent, license, trademark or other
    intellectual property rights, our revenues, results of
    operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.

Provisions
    in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as any
    shareholders’ rights plan, may discourage a takeover
    attempt.

Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire
    us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders.
    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose
    various procedural and other requirements, which could make it
    more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate
    actions. For example, our certificate of incorporation
    authorizes our Board of Directors to determine the rights,
    preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of
    preferred stock, without any vote or action by our shareholders.
    Thus, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of
    preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could
    adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our
    Series A common stock. These rights may have the effect of
    delaying or deterring a change of control of our Company. In
    addition, a change of control of our company may be delayed or
    deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors
    (each class elected for a three year term) or as a result of any
    shareholders’ rights plan that our Board of Directors may
    adopt. These provisions could limit the price that certain
    investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
    our Series A common stock.



Risks
    Related to the Acquisition of Celanese GmbH, formerly Celanese
    AG

The
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss
    transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”) and/or
    the compensation paid in connection with the squeeze out may be
    increased, which may further reduce the funds that our
    subsidiary, BCP Holdings GmbH, a German limited liability
    company (“BCP Holdings”), can otherwise make available
    to us.

Several minority shareholders of Celanese GmbH have initiated
    special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the
    amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed
    annual payment offered under the Domination Agreement. On
    December 12, 2006, the Frankfurt District Court appointed
    an expert to help determine the value of Celanese AG as of
    July 31, 2004, on which date an extraordinary shareholder
    meeting of Celanese AG was held to resolve the Domination
    Agreement. As a result of these proceedings, the amounts of the
    fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment
    could be increased by the court, and BCP Holdings would be
    required to make such payments within two months after the
    publication of the court’s ruling. Any such increase may be
    substantial. All minority shareholders would be entitled to
    claim the respective higher amounts. This may reduce the funds
    BCP Holdings can make available to us and, accordingly, diminish
    our ability to make payments on our indebtedness. See
    Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for further information.

The Company also received applications for the commencement of
    award proceedings filed by 79 shareholders against BCP
    Holdings with the Frankfurt District Court requesting the court
    to set a higher amount for the Squeeze-Out compensation. Should
    the court set a higher value for the Squeeze-Out compensation,
    former Celanese AG shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of
    Celanese AG due to the Squeeze-Out are entitled, pursuant to a
    settlement agreement between BCP Holdings and certain former
    Celanese AG shareholders, to claim for their shares the higher
    of the compensation amounts determined by the court in these
    different proceedings. Previously received compensation for
    their shares will be offset so that those shareholders who
    ceased to be shareholders of Celanese AG due to the Squeeze-Out
    are not entitled to more than higher of the amount set in the
    two court proceedings.

Celanese
    Deutschland Holding GmbH (“CDH”) may be required to
    compensate BCP Holdings for annual losses, which may reduce the
    funds CDH can otherwise make available to us.

CDH and BCP Holdings have entered into a profit and loss
    transfer agreement on December 3, 2009 which became
    effective on December 10, 2009 (the “PLTA”).
    Under the PLTA, CDH is required, among other things, to
    compensate BCP Holdings for any annual loss incurred, determined
    in accordance with German accounting requirements, by BCP
    Holdings at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was
    incurred. This obligation to compensate BCP Holdings for annual
    losses will apply during the entire term of the PLTA. If BCP
    Holdings incurs losses during any period of the operative term
    of the PLTA and if such losses lead to an annual loss of BCP
    Holdings at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of
    the PLTA, CDH will be obligated to make a corresponding cash
    payment to BCP Holdings to the extent that the respective annual
    loss is not fully compensated for by the dissolution of profit
    reserves accrued at the level of BCP Holdings during the term of
    the PLTA. CDH may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to
    BCP Holdings by off-setting against such loss compensation
    claims made by BCP Holdings any valuable counterclaims against
    BCP Holdings that CDH may have. If CDH is obligated to make cash
    payments to BCP Holdings to cover an annual loss, we may not
    have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when
    due and, unless CDH is able to obtain funds from a source other
    than annual profits of BCP Holdings, CDH may not be able to
    satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall.

BCP
    Holdings may be required to compensate Celanese GmbH for annual
    losses, which may reduce the funds BCP Holdings can otherwise
    make available to us.

BCP Holdings and Celanese GmbH have entered into a new
    domination agreement on March 26, 2010 which became
    effective on April 9, 2010 (the “Domination Agreement
    II”). Under the Domination Agreement II, BCP Holdings is
    required, among other things, to compensate Celanese GmbH for
    any annual loss incurred, determined in accordance with German
    accounting requirements, by Celanese GmbH at the end of the
    fiscal year in which the



loss was incurred. This obligation to compensate Celanese GmbH
    for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the
    Domination Agreement II. If Celanese GmbH incurs losses during
    any period of the operative term of the Domination
    Agreement II and if such losses lead to an annual loss of
    Celanese GmbH at the end of any given fiscal year during the
    term of the Domination Agreement II, BCP Holdings will be
    obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to Celanese GmbH
    to the extent that the respective annual loss is not fully
    compensated for by the dissolution of profit reserves accrued at
    the level of Celanese GmbH during the term of the Domination
    Agreement II. BCP Holdings may be able to reduce or avoid
    cash payments to Celanese GmbH by off-setting against such loss
    compensation claims by Celanese GmbH any valuable counterclaims
    against Celanese GmbH that BCP Holdings may have. If BCP
    Holdings is obligated to make cash payments to Celanese GmbH to
    cover an annual loss, we may not have sufficient funds to make
    payments on our indebtedness when due and, unless BCP Holdings
    is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits
    of Celanese GmbH, BCP Holdings may not be able to satisfy its
    obligation to fund such shortfall.

Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness

Our
    level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise
    additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to
    react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and
    prevent us from meeting obligations under our
    indebtedness.

Our total indebtedness is approximately $3.2 billion as of
    December 31, 2010. See Note 13 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements for further information.

Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences,
    including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry
    conditions including exacerbating the impact of any adverse
    business effects that are determined to be material adverse
    events under our existing senior credit facilities (the
    “Senior Credit Agreement”);

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities or pay dividends on our common stock;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service
    requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other
    purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who have less debt.

We may
    be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, which
    could increase the risks described above.

Although covenants under the Senior Credit Agreement and the
    Indenture governing the $600 million in aggregate principal
    amount of


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2018 (the “Notes”) limit our ability to
    incur certain additional indebtedness, these restrictions are
    subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the
    indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these
    restrictions could be significant. To the extent that we incur
    additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our leverage
    described above, including our possible inability to service our
    debt, including the Notes, would increase.

Our
    variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk,
    which could cause our debt service obligations to increase
    significantly and affect our operating results.

Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and
    expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to
    increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate
    indebtedness would increase. As of December 31, 2010,



we had $1.6 billion, €296 million and CNY
    1.5 billion of variable rate debt, of which
    $1.5 billion and €150 million is hedged with
    interest rate swaps, which leaves $73 million,
    €146 million and CNY 1.5 billion of variable rate
    debt subject to interest rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1%
    increase in interest rates would increase annual interest
    expense by approximately $5 million. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations – Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 21
    to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
    further information.

We may
    not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our
    indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy
    obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be
    successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on the financial condition and
    operating performance of our subsidiaries, which is subject to
    prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain
    financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may
    not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
    activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
    premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or
    delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital
    or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such
    operating results and resources, we could face substantial
    liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material
    assets or operations to meet our debt service and other
    obligations. The Senior Credit Agreement restricts our ability
    to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition.
    We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain
    the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds
    may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then
    due.

Restrictive
    covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage
    in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make
    payments on our indebtedness.

The Senior Credit Agreement and the Indenture governing the
    Notes each contain various covenants that limit our ability to
    engage in specified types of transactions. The Indenture
    governing the Notes will limit Celanese US’s and certain of
    its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur
    additional debt; pay dividends or make other restricted
    payments; consummate specified asset sales; enter into
    transactions with affiliates; incur liens, impose restrictions
    on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments
    to Celanese US and its restricted subsidiaries; merge or
    consolidate with any other person; and sell, assign, transfer,
    lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
    of Celanese US’s assets or the assets of its restricted
    subsidiaries.

In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement requires us to maintain
    a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are
    outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Our
    ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events
    beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet this test at
    all.

Such restrictions in our debt instruments could result in us
    having to obtain the consent of holders of the Notes and of our
    lenders in order to take certain actions. Disruptions in credit
    markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult
    or more costly for us to obtain such consents. Our ability to
    expand our business or to address declines in our business may
    be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default,
    which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Furthermore, a default under the Senior Credit
    Agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our
    indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement and to terminate
    any commitments to lend. If we were unable to repay such
    indebtedness, the lenders under the Senior Credit Agreement
    could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure
    that indebtedness. Our subsidiaries have pledged a significant
    portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness
    under the Senior Credit Agreement. If the lenders under the
    Senior Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of such
    indebtedness, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such
    amounts or our other indebtedness, including the Notes. In such
    event, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.



Celanese
    and Celanese US are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries
    to satisfy their obligations under the Notes and the guarantee
    of Celanese US’s obligations under the Notes by
    Celanese.

As holding companies, Celanese and Celanese US conduct
    substantially all of their operations through their
    subsidiaries, which own substantially all of our consolidated
    assets. Consequently, the principal source of cash to pay
    Celanese and Celanese US’s obligations, including
    obligations under the Notes and the guarantee of the Celanese
    US’s obligations under the Notes by Celanese, is the cash
    that our subsidiaries generate from their operations. We cannot
    assure that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted
    to, make distributions to enable Celanese US

and/or

Celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations. Each
    of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under
    certain circumstances, applicable state laws, regulatory
    limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit Celanese
    US’s and Celanese’s ability to obtain cash from our
    subsidiaries. While the Indenture governing the Notes limits the
    ability of our subsidiaries to restrict their ability to pay
    dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these
    limitations are subject to certain qualifications and
    exceptions, which may have the effect of significantly
    restricting the applicability of those limits. In the event
    Celanese US

and/or

Celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries,
    Celanese US

and/or

Celanese may be unable to make required payments on the Notes,
    the guarantee of Celanese US’s obligations under the Notes
    by Celanese, or our other indebtedness.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our
    business, relating to such matters as product liability,
    contract antitrust, intellectual property, workers’
    compensation, chemical exposure, prior acquisitions, past waste
    disposal practices and release of chemicals into the
    environment. While it is impossible at this time to determine
    with certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims, we are actively defending those matters
    where the Company is named as a defendant. Additionally, we
    believe, based on the advice of legal counsel, that adequate
    reserves have been made and that the ultimate outcomes of all
    such litigation claims will not have a material adverse effect
    on our financial position, but may have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given
    accounting period. See Note 23 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements for a discussion of
    commitments and contingencies related to legal and regulatory
    proceedings.

Holders

No shares of Celanese’s Series B common stock and no
    shares of Celanese’s 4.25% convertible perpetual preferred
    stock (“Preferred Stock”) are issued and outstanding.
    As of February 4, 2011, there were 46 holders of record of
    our Series A common stock. By including persons holding
    shares in broker accounts under street names, however, we
    estimate our shareholder base to be approximately 33,500.

On February 1, 2010, we delivered notice to the holders of
    our Preferred Stock that we were calling for the redemption of
    all of our 9,600,000 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.
    Holders of the Preferred Stock were entitled to convert each
    share of Preferred Stock into 1.2600 shares of our
    Series A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at any
    time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
    February 19, 2010. As of such date, holders of Preferred
    Stock had elected to convert 9,591,276 shares of Preferred
    Stock into an aggregate of 12,084,942 shares of
    Series A common stock. The 8,724 shares of Preferred
    Stock that remained outstanding after such conversions were
    redeemed by us on February 22, 2010 for 7,437 shares
    of Series A common stock, in accordance with the terms of
    the Preferred Stock. In addition to the shares of Series A
    common stock issued in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock
    converted and redeemed, we paid cash in lieu of fractional
    shares. See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the Preferred
    Stock redemption.

Dividend
    Policy

Our Board of Directors has a policy of declaring, subject to
    legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share
    of our Series A common stock as determined in its sole
    discretion. Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly dividends
    of $0.04 per share on February 1, 2010 and May 1, 2010
    and similar quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2009. In
    April 2010, our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in
    the quarterly dividend rate from $0.04 to $0.05 per share of
    Series A common stock, which equates to $0.20 per share
    annually. Pursuant to this policy change, we paid quarterly
    dividends of $0.05 per share on August 2, 2010 and
    November 1, 2010. The annual



cash dividend declared and paid during the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $28 million and
    $23 million, respectively. Our Board of Directors may, at
    any time, modify or revoke our dividend policy on our
    Series A common stock.

We were required under the terms of our Preferred Stock to pay
    scheduled quarterly dividends, subject to legally available
    funds for so long as the Preferred Stock remains outstanding.
    Pursuant to this policy, we paid quarterly dividends of
    $0.265625 per share on our Preferred Stock on February 1,
    2010 and similar quarterly dividends during each quarter of
    2009. No dividends were declared or paid subsequent to
    February 1, 2010 as a result of the Preferred Stock
    redemption as described above. The annual cash dividend declared
    and paid during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $3 million and $10 million, respectively.

On January 6, 2011, we declared a cash dividend of $0.05
    per share on our Series A common stock amounting to
    $8 million. The cash dividend is for the period from
    November 2, 2010 to January 31, 2011 and was paid on
    February 1, 2011 to holders of record as of
    January 18, 2011.

Based on the increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.04
    to $0.05 per share of Series A common stock beginning
    August 2010, number of outstanding shares as of
    December 31, 2010 and considering the redemption of our
    Preferred Stock, cash dividends to be paid in 2011 are expected
    to be comparable to those paid in 2010.

The amount available to us to pay cash dividends is restricted
    by our Senior Credit Agreement and the terms of our Notes. Any
    decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made
    at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on,
    among other things, our results of operations, cash
    requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and
    other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

The shares to be issued under plans not approved by shareholders
    relate to the Celanese Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan,
    which is our former broad-based stock incentive plan for
    executive officers, key employees and directors. The 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan allowed for the issuance or delivery of shares of
    our common stock through the award of stock options, restricted
    stock units and other stock-based awards as approved by the
    compensation committee of the board of directors. The 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan was effectively replaced by the Celanese
    Corporation 2009 Global Incentive Plan. No further awards were
    made pursuant to the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan upon shareholder
    approval of the 2009 Global Incentive Plan in April 2009. Both
    the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2009 Global Incentive Plan
    are described in more detail in Note 19 of the accompanying
    notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities

Our deferred compensation plan offers certain of our senior
    employees and directors the opportunity to defer a portion of
    their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal
    to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts based upon the
    market-performance of specified measurement funds selected by
    the participant. These deferred compensation obligations may be
    considered securities of Celanese. Participants were required to
    make deferral elections under the plan prior to January 1 of the
    year such deferrals will be withheld from their compensation. We
    relied on the exemption from registration provided by
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act in making this offer to
    a select group of employees, fewer than 35 of which were
    non-accredited investors under the rules promulgated by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.



Item 6.

Selected
    Financial Data

The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the statements of operations data for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, all of which are set
    forth below, are derived from the consolidated financial
    statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and should
    be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the
    notes thereto. The balance sheet data as of December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006 and the statements of operations data for
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 shown below were
    derived from previously issued financial statements, adjusted
    for applicable discontinued operations and the Ibn Sina
    accounting change described below.

Ibn
    Sina

We indirectly own a 25% interest in Ibn Sina through CTE
    Petrochemicals Company (“CTE”), a venture with Texas
    Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. (which also indirectly owns
    25%). The remaining interest in Ibn Sina is held by Saudi Basic
    Industries Corporation (“SABIC”). SABIC and CTE
    entered into the Ibn Sina joint venture agreement in 1981. In
    April 2010, we announced that Ibn Sina will construct a 50,000
    ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia and that the term of
    the joint venture agreement was extended until 2032. Ibn
    Sina’s existing natural gas supply contract expires in
    2022. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our indirect
    economic interest in Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to 32.5%.
    SABIC’s economic interest will remain unchanged.

In connection with this transaction, we reassessed the factors
    surrounding the accounting method for this investment and
    changed from the cost method of accounting for investments to
    the equity method of accounting for investments beginning
    April 1, 2010. Financial information relating to this
    investment for periods prior to 2010 has been retrospectively
    adjusted to apply the equity method of accounting.

In addition, effective April 1, 2010, we moved our
    investment in the Ibn Sina affiliate from our Acetyl
    Intermediates segment to our Advanced Engineered Materials
    segment to reflect the change in the affiliate’s business
    dynamics and growth opportunities as a result of the future
    construction of the POM facility.

•

various other factors, both referenced and not referenced in
    this document.

Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are,
    therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks
    or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions
    prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements
    may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report
    as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned
    or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to
    update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
    their dates.

Overview

During 2010, we made significant progress in executing our
    strategic objectives. As detailed below, we optimized our
    portfolio, realigned our manufacturing footprint, continued our
    expansion efforts in Asia, improved our financing arrangements,
    made technological advancements, and took other strategic
    actions to deliver value for our shareholders.

    Highlights:

•

We announced our newly developed advanced technology to produce
    ethanol. This innovative, new process combines our proprietary
    and leading acetyl platform with highly advanced manufacturing
    technology to produce ethanol from hydrocarbon-sourced
    feedstocks.

•

We launched
    VitalDose

tm

,

    an ethylene vinyl acetate (“EVA”) polymer-based
    excipient that facilitates drug makers’ efforts to develop
    and commercialize controlled-release pharmaceutical solutions.

•

We announced that Fortron Industries, LLC, one of our strategic
    affiliates, will increase its production at its Wilmington,
    North Carolina plant to meet an increased global demand for
    Fortron

®

polyphenylene sulfide (“PPS”), a high-performance
    polymer used in demanding industrial applications. The Fortron
    Industries plant is the world’s largest linear PPS
    operation with a 15,000 metric ton annual capacity.

•

We announced a plan to close our acetate flake and tow
    manufacturing operations in Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom in
    the latter part of 2011. We expect the project to cost between
    $80 million and $120 million, with annual cash savings
    of $40 million to $60 million.

•

We completed an amendment and extension to our senior secured
    credit facility and completed an offering of $600 million
    of senior unsecured notes. We used the proceeds from the sale of
    the notes and $200 million of cash on hand to repay
    $800 million of borrowings under our term loan facility.
    These actions resulted in a reduction of our previous
    $2.7 billion term loan facility maturing in 2014 to
    $2.5 billion of secured and unsecured debt with staggered
    maturities in 2014, 2016 and 2018.

•

We acquired two product lines,
    Zenite

®

liquid crystal polymer (“LCP”) and
    Thermx

®

polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate (“PCT”),
    from DuPont Performance Polymers (“DuPont”).



•

We announced five-year Environmental Health and Safety
    sustainability goals for occupational safety performance, energy
    intensity, greenhouse gases and waste management intended to be
    achieved by the year 2015.

•

We received American Chemistry Council’s (“ACC”)
    2010 Responsible Care Initiative of the Year Award. This award
    recognizes companies that demonstrate leadership in the areas of
    employee health and safety, security or environmental protection
    in the chemistry industry.

•

We announced the construction of a 50,000 ton polyacetal
    (“POM”) production facility by our National Methanol
    Company affiliate (“Ibn Sina”) in Saudi Arabia and
    extended the term of the joint venture, which will now run until
    2032. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our indirect
    economic interest in Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to a total
    of 32.5%.

•

We received formal approval of our previously announced plans to
    expand flake and tow capacities, each by 30,000 tons, at our
    affiliate facility in Nantong, China, with our affiliate
    partner, China National Tobacco Corporation.

•

We announced a 25% increase in our quarterly Series A
    common stock cash dividend beginning August 2010. Accordingly,
    the annual dividend rate increased from $0.16 to $0.20 per share
    of Series A common stock and the quarterly rate increased
    from $0.04 to $0.05 per share of Series A common stock.

•

We redeemed all of our Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock for
    Series A common stock on February 22, 2010.

    Outlook

Based on the strength of our 2010 performance, our confidence in
    our earnings growth programs and our expectations for a
    continued, modest global economic recovery, we expect 2011
    results to improve as compared to 2010. We expect our unique
    portfolio of technology and specialty materials businesses,
    coupled with our ongoing growth, innovation and productivity
    initiatives, will enable us to deliver earnings improvement. We
    anticipate healthy demand across all of our business segments
    and expect to see earnings growth in every segment in 2011.

In January 2011, we signed letters of intent for projects to
    construct and operate industrial ethanol production facilities
    in Nanjing, China, at the Nanjing Chemical Industrial Park, and
    in Zhuhai, China, at the Gaolan Port Economic Zone. We also
    signed a memorandum of understanding with Wison (China) Holding
    Co., Ltd., a Chinese synthesis gas supplier, for production of
    certain feedstocks used in our advanced ethanol production
    process.

Results
    of Operations

Ibn
    Sina

We indirectly own a 25% interest in Ibn Sina through CTE
    Petrochemicals Company (“CTE”), a joint venture with
    Texas Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. (which also indirectly
    owns 25%). The remaining interest in Ibn Sina is held by Saudi
    Basic Industries Corporation (“SABIC”). SABIC and CTE
    entered into the Ibn Sina joint venture agreement in 1981. In
    April 2010, we announced that Ibn Sina will construct a 50,000
    ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia and that the term of
    the joint venture agreement was extended until 2032. Ibn
    Sina’s existing natural gas supply contract expires in
    2022. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our indirect
    economic interest in Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to 32.5%.
    SABIC’s economic interest will remain unchanged.

In connection with this transaction, we reassessed the factors
    surrounding the accounting method for this investment and
    changed the accounting from the cost method of accounting for
    investments to the equity method of accounting for investments
    beginning April 1, 2010. Financial information relating to
    this investment for prior periods has been retrospectively
    adjusted to apply the equity method of accounting.



In addition, effective April 1, 2010, we moved our
    investment in the Ibn Sina affiliate from our Acetyl
    Intermediates segment to our Advanced Engineered Materials
    segment to reflect the change in the affiliate’s business
    dynamics and growth opportunities. Business segment information
    for prior periods included below has been retrospectively
    adjusted to reflect the change and to conform to the current
    year presentation.

Consolidated
    Results — Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared
    with Year Ended December 31, 2009

During 2010 the global economy gradually began to recover from
    the challenging economic environment we experienced during the
    second half of 2008 and throughout 2009. Net sales increased in
    2010 from 2009 primarily due to increased volumes as a result of
    the gradual recovery and increased selling prices across the
    majority of our business segments. The increase in net sales
    resulting from our acquisition of FACT GmbH (Future Advanced
    Composites Technology) (“FACT”) in December 2009 only
    slightly offset the decrease in net sales due to the sale of



our polyvinyl alcohol (“PVOH”) business in July 2009
    within our Industrial Specialties segment. Unfavorable foreign
    currency impacts only slightly offset the increase in net sales.

Gross profit increased due to higher net sales. Gross profit as
    a percentage of sales remained consistent with prior year as
    increased pricing offset increased raw material and energy costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we wrote-off other
    productive assets of $18 million related to our Singapore
    and Nanjing, China facilities. In March 2010, we recorded
    $22 million of accelerated amortization to write-off the
    asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a
    supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009. The accelerated
    amortization was recorded as $20 million to our Acetyl
    Intermediates segment and $2 million to our Advanced
    Engineered Materials segment. Both the write-off of other
    productive assets and accelerated amortization were recorded to
    Cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during
    2010 primarily due to the increase in net sales and higher legal
    costs and costs associated with business optimization
    initiatives. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and
    administrative expenses declined slightly as compared to 2009
    due to our continued fixed spending reduction efforts,
    restructuring efficiencies and a positive impact from foreign
    currency.

In March 2010, we concluded that certain long-lived assets were
    partially impaired at our acetate flake and tow manufacturing
    operations in Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom. Accordingly, we
    wrote down the related property, plant and equipment to its fair
    value of $31 million, resulting in long-lived asset
    impairment losses of $72 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2010. As a result of the announced closure of
    our acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations in Spondon,
    Derby, United Kingdom, we recorded $15 million of employee
    termination benefits during the year ended December 31,
    2010.

As a result of our Pardies, France “Project of
    Closure”, we recorded exit costs of $12 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2010, which consisted of
    $6 million in employee termination benefits,
    $1 million of long-lived asset impairment losses,
    $2 million of contract termination costs and other plant
    closure costs and $3 million of reindustrialization costs.

Due to certain events in October 2008 and subsequent periodic
    cessations of production of our specialty polymers products
    produced at our EVA Performance Polymers facility in Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada, we declared two events of force majeure. During
    2009, we replaced long-lived assets damaged in October 2008. As
    a result of these events and subsequent periodic cessations of
    production, we recorded $18 million of net insurance
    recoveries consisting of $8 million related to property
    damage and $10 million related to business interruption.



As a result of several business optimization projects undertaken
    by us beginning in 2009 and continuing throughout 2010, we
    recorded $11 million in employee termination costs during
    the year ended December 31, 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded
    $14 million of recoveries and $45 million of
    reductions in legal reserves related to lawsuits alleging that
    certain plastics utilized in the production of plumbing systems
    for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing
    systems to fail. See Note 23 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements for further information
    regarding the plumbing actions.

In November 2006, we finalized a settlement agreement with the
    Frankfurt, Germany Airport (“Fraport”) to relocate the
    Kelsterbach, Germany Ticona operations resolving several years
    of legal disputes related to the planned Fraport expansion.
    During 2010, we recorded $26 million of expenses related to
    the Ticona Kelsterbach relocation. See Note 28 to the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
    information regarding the Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2010 also
    included gains of $13 million, net, related to settlements
    in resolution of a commercial disputes.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates and dividend income from
    cost investments increased during 2010 as compared to the same
    period in 2009. Our strategic affiliates have experienced
    similar volume increases due to increased demand during the year
    ended December 31, 2010. As a result, our proportional
    share of net earnings from equity affiliates increased
    $69 million and our dividend income from cost investments
    increased $16 million for the year ended December 31,
    2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.

Our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2010 was 21% compared to (97)% for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. Our effective tax rate for
    2009 was favorably impacted by the release of the US valuation
    allowance on net deferred tax assets, partially offset by
    increases in valuation allowances on certain foreign net
    deferred tax assets and the effect of new tax legislation in
    Mexico. The effective rate for the year ended December 31,
    2010 was favorably impacted by amendments to tax legislation in
    Mexico.

Consolidated
    Results — Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared
    with Year Ended December 31, 2008

The challenging economic environment in the United States and
    Europe during the second half of 2008 continued throughout 2009.
    Net sales declined in 2009 from 2008 primarily as a result of
    decreased demand due to the significant weakness of the global
    economy. In July 2009, we completed the sale of our PVOH
    business which also contributed to the declines in our sales
    volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to see a
    gradual recovery in the global economy with increasing demand
    within some of our business segments. A decrease in selling
    prices was also a significant factor on the decrease in net
    sales. Decreases in key raw material and energy costs were the
    primary factors in lower selling prices. A slightly unfavorable
    foreign currency impact also contributed to the decrease in net
    sales.

Gross profit declined due to lower net sales. As a percentage of
    sales, gross profit increased as lower raw material and energy
    costs more than offset decreases in net sales during the period.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased during
    2009 primarily due to business optimization and finance
    improvement initiatives.

During the first quarter of 2009, we began efforts to align
    production capacity and staffing levels with our view of an
    economic environment of prolonged lower demand. For the year
    ended December 31, 2009, other charges included employee
    termination benefits of $40 million related to this
    endeavor. As a result of the shutdown of the vinyl acetate
    monomer (“VAM”) production unit in Cangrejera, Mexico,
    we recognized employee termination benefits of $1 million
    and long-lived asset impairment losses of $1 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

As a result of the “Project of Closure” at our
    Pardies, France facility, other charges included exit costs of
    $89 million during the year ended December 31, 2009,
    which consisted of $60 million in employee termination
    benefits, $17 million of contract termination costs and
    $12 million of long-lived asset impairment losses.

Due to continued declines in demand in automotive and electronic
    sectors, we announced plans to reduce capacity by ceasing
    polyester polymer production at our Ticona manufacturing plant
    in Shelby, North Carolina. Other charges for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 included employee termination benefits of
    $2 million and long-lived asset impairment losses of
    $1 million related to this event.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    partially offset by $6 million of net insurance recoveries
    in satisfaction of claims we made related to the unplanned
    outage of our Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid facility during
    2007, a $9 million decrease in legal reserves for plumbing
    claims due to the Company’s ongoing assessment of the
    likely outcome of the plumbing actions and the expiration of the
    statute of limitation.

In November 2006, we finalized a settlement agreement with the
    Frankfurt, Germany Airport (“Fraport”) to relocate the
    Kelsterbach, Germany Ticona operations resolving several years
    of legal disputes related to the planned Fraport expansion.
    During 2009, we recorded $16 million of expenses related to
    the Ticona Kelsterbach relocation.

Operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher
    other charges partially offset by lower selling, general and
    administrative costs.

Equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased during 2009,
    primarily due to reduced earnings from our Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased demand.

Our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 was (97)% compared to 15% for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Our effective tax rate for
    2009 was favorably impacted by the release of the US valuation
    allowance, partially offset by lower earnings in jurisdictions
    participating in tax holidays, increases in valuation allowances
    on certain foreign net deferred tax assets and the effect of new
    tax legislation in Mexico.

Our Advanced Engineered Materials segment develops, produces and
    supplies a broad portfolio of high performance specialty
    polymers for application in automotive, medical and electronics
    products, as well as other consumer and industrial applications.
    Together with our strategic affiliates, our Advanced Engineered



Materials segment is a leading participant in the global
    specialty polymers industry. The primary products of Advanced
    Engineered Materials are POM, PPS, long-fiber reinforced
    thermoplastics (“LFT”), polybutylene terephthalate
    (“PBT”), polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”),
    ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene
    (“GUR

®

”)

    and LCP. POM, PPS, LFT, PBT and PET are used in a broad range of
    products including automotive components, electronics,
    appliances and industrial applications.
    GUR

®

is used in battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration
    equipment, coatings and medical devices. Primary end markets for
    LCP are electrical and electronics.

Advanced Engineered Materials’ net sales increased
    $301 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in net sales
    is primarily related to significant increases in volume which
    are due to the gradual recovery in the global economy, continued
    success in the innovation and commercialization of new products
    and applications and the acquisition of FACT in December 2009.
    Net sales was also positively impacted by increases in average
    pricing as a result of implemented price increases in addition
    to integrating the DuPont product lines LCP and PCT that were
    acquired in May 2010 into our sales process during the fourth
    quarter. These increases were only partially offset by
    unfavorable foreign currency impacts.

Operating profit increased $148 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
    The positive impact from higher sales volumes, increased pricing
    for our high performance polymers and higher production volumes,
    including a planned inventory build for the relocation of our
    facility in Kelsterbach, Germany, more than offset higher raw
    material and energy costs. Other charges positively impacted
    operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2010
    driven by a $45 million decrease in legal reserves and
    $14 million of recoveries associated with plumbing actions
    partially offset by expenses related to our European expansion
    and Kelsterbach relocation. Depreciation and amortization
    includes $2 million of accelerated amortization for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 to write-off the asset
    associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a
    supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax increased for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period
    in 2009 due to increased operating profit and increased equity
    in net earnings of affiliates. Our equity affiliates, including
    Ibn Sina, have experienced similar volume increases due to
    increased demand during the year ended December 31, 2010.
    As a result, our proportional share of net earnings of these
    affiliates increased $66 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.

The economic outlook within the automotive and electronic
    industries continues to look favorable entering into 2011 with
    seasonally strong demand. We are anticipating a continued strong

value-in-use

pricing environment supported by higher raw material costs. As
    we progress with the relocation of our Kelsterbach, Germany
    operations and expansion of capacity in Europe, we will continue
    to build inventory to support our customers in their product
    qualification process.

Our Consumer Specialties segment consists of our Acetate
    Products and Nutrinova businesses. Our Acetate Products business
    primarily produces and supplies acetate tow, which is used in
    the production of filter products. We also produce acetate
    flake, which is processed into acetate tow and acetate film. Our
    Nutrinova business produces and sells
    Sunett

®

,

    a high intensity sweetener, and food protection ingredients,
    such as sorbates and sorbic acid, for the food, beverage and
    pharmaceuticals industries.

Net sales for Consumer Specialties increased $14 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the
    same period in 2009. The increase in volume and price in our
    Acetate Products business more than offset the decline in volume
    and price in our Nutrinova business as lower demand in
    Sunett

®

negatively impacted net sales.

During the first half of 2010, we experienced a decline in net
    sales related to an electrical disruption and subsequent
    production outage at our Acetate Products manufacturing facility
    in Narrows, Virginia. The facility resumed normal operations
    during the second quarter of 2010 and we recovered the impacted
    volume during the second half of 2010 as we experienced
    increased volumes in our Acetate Products business due to higher
    demand in acetate tow and improved business in acetate film.

Operating profit decreased for the year ended December 31,
    2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. An increase in
    other charges for the year ended December 31, 2010 had the
    most significant impact on operating profit as it was
    unfavorably impacted by long-lived asset impairment losses of
    $72 million associated with management’s assessment of
    the closure of our acetate flake and tow production operations
    in Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom during the three months ended
    March 31, 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, earnings from
    continuing operations before tax decreased due to lower
    operating profit, which was partially offset by higher dividends
    from our China ventures of $15 million compared to 2009.

We expect demand to be relatively flat during the first quarter
    of 2011; however, slightly lower sales are expected due to
    seasonal trends. Margin expansion driven by sustainable
    productivity initiatives is expected to continue in 2011. In
    addition, we expect spending to be higher during the first
    quarter of 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 due to
    plant turnaround costs.

Our Industrial Specialties segment includes our Emulsions and
    EVA Performance Polymers businesses. Our Emulsions business is a
    global leader that produces a broad product portfolio,
    specializing in vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions, and is a
    recognized authority on low volatile organic compounds, an
    environmentally-friendly technology. Our emulsions products are
    used in a wide array of applications including paints and
    coatings, adhesives, construction, glass fiber, textiles and
    paper. EVA Performance Polymers business offers a complete line
    of low-density polyethylene and specialty EVA resins and
    compounds. EVA Performance Polymers’ products are used in
    many applications including flexible packaging films, lamination
    film products, hot melt adhesives, medical devices and tubing,
    automotive carpeting and solar cell encapsulation films.

In July 2009, we completed the sale of our PVOH business to
    Sekisui Chemical Co., Ltd. (“Sekisui”) for a net cash
    purchase price of $168 million, excluding the value of
    accounts receivable and payable we retained. The transaction
    resulted in a gain on disposition of $34 million and
    includes long-term supply agreements between Sekisui and
    Celanese.

Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in 2009. Increased net sales were a
    result of higher growth and innovation volumes from our
    Emulsions business and higher volumes from our EVA Performance
    Polymers business partially offset by impacts resulting from the
    sale of our PVOH business in July 2009. The increase in our EVA
    Performance Polymers business’ volumes was partly as a
    result of our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant being fully
    operational during 2010. Volumes were lower during 2009 due to
    technical issues at our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant. Such
    technical production issues were resolved and normal operations
    resumed prior to the end of the third quarter of 2009. Higher
    prices in our EVA Performance Polymers business due to price
    increases and favorable product mix were partially offset by
    lower prices in our Emulsions business due to unfavorable
    foreign exchange rates.

Due to certain events in October 2008 and subsequent periodic
    cessations of production of our specialty polymers products
    produced at our EVA Performance Polymers facility in Edmonton,
    Alberta, Canada, we declared two events of force majeure. During
    2009, we replaced long-lived assets damaged in October 2008. As
    a result of these events and subsequent periodic cessation of
    production, we recorded $25 million and $10 million of
    insurance recoveries to other charges during the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts
    were partially offset by $7 million and $10 million,
    respectively, recorded as a charge by our captive insurance
    companies included in the Other Activities segment. The net
    insurance recoveries recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 of $18 million consisted of
    $8 million related to property damage and $10 million
    related to business interruption.

Operating profit remained unchanged for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.
    Increases in operating profit in 2010 are primarily due to the
    resumption of normal operations at our EVA



Performance Polymers facility, net insurance proceeds received
    in 2010 and increases in sales volumes and prices. These
    increases were offset by the 2009 gain on disposition of assets
    related to the divestiture of our PVOH business and higher raw
    material costs in both our EVA Performance Polymers and
    Emulsions businesses.

In 2011 we expect to see positive industry conditions with
    volume demands continuing to increase from those levels
    experienced in 2010. We also anticipate margin expansion due to
    a robust pricing environment and higher margins on new products.

Our Acetyl Intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl
    products, including acetic acid, VAM, acetic anhydride and
    acetate esters. These products are generally used as starting
    materials for colorants, paints, adhesives, coatings, textiles,
    medicines and more. Other chemicals produced in this business
    segment are organic solvents and intermediates for
    pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical products. To meet the
    growing demand for acetic acid in China and to support ongoing
    site optimization efforts, we successfully expanded our acetic
    acid unit in Nanjing, China from 600,000 tons per reactor
    annually to 1.2 million tons per reactor annually during
    the fourth quarter of 2009. Using new
    AOPlus

®


    capability, the acetic acid unit could be further expanded to
    1.5 million tons per reactor annually with only modest
    additional capital.

Acetyl Intermediates’ net sales increased $479 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the
    same period in 2009 due to improvement in the global economy
    resulting in increased overall demand across all regions for the
    major acetyl derivative product lines. Increases in volume were
    also a direct result of our successful acetic acid expansion at
    our Nanjing, China plant. We also experienced favorable pricing
    which was driven by rising raw material costs and price
    increases in acetic acid and VAM across all regions. The
    increase in net sales was only slightly offset by unfavorable
    foreign currency impacts.

Operating profit increased during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The
    increase in operating profit is primarily due to higher volumes
    and prices and reduction in plant costs resulting from the
    closure of our less advantaged acetic acid and VAM production
    operations in Pardies, France. A decrease in other charges, due
    primarily to the reduction of plant closure costs related to the
    2009 closure of our Pardies, France facility, also had a
    favorable impact on operating profit. These increases to
    operating profit were only slightly offset by higher variable
    costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Higher variable
    costs were a direct result of price increases in all major raw
    materials. Depreciation and amortization includes
    $20 million of accelerated amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 to write-off the asset associated with a
    raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for
    bankruptcy during 2009.



Earnings from continuing operations before tax increased during
    the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same
    period in 2009 due to increased operating profit.

Entering into 2011, we expect to see a relatively flat first
    quarter. Decreasing volumes in Asia as a result of the Chinese
    new year are expected to offset seasonal increases in demand in
    the US and Europe. Overall growth in Asia for 2011 is
    anticipated. In addition, our advanced acetyl technology is
    expected to sustain acetic acid margins and process innovation
    and productivity are expected to positively impact 2011.

Other
    Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs,
    including financing and administrative activities, and our
    captive insurance companies.

The operating loss for Other Activities increased
    $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily
    due to a $38 million increase in selling, general and
    administrative costs, which was only partially offset by a
    $14 million gain on the sale of an office building. Higher
    selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due
    to higher legal costs and costs associated with business
    optimization initiatives.

The loss from continuing operations before tax increased
    $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in 2009. The increase is primarily
    related to $16 million of fees associated with our debt
    refinancing that occurred during the three months ended
    September 30, 2010.

Net sales decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a
    result of lower sales volumes. Significant weakness in the
    global economy experienced during the first half of the year
    resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for automotive,
    electrical and electronic products as well as for other
    industrial products. As a result, sales volumes dropped
    significantly across all product lines. During the second half
    of 2009, we experienced a continued increase in demand compared
    with the first half of the year as a result of programs like
    “Cash for Clunkers” in the United States during the
    third quarter of 2009 and a gradual recovery in the global
    economy during the fourth quarter of 2009.



Operating profit increased in 2009 as compared to 2008. Lower
    raw material and energy costs and decreased overall spending
    more than offset the decline in net sales. Decreased overall
    spending was the result of our fixed spending reduction efforts.
    Non-capital spending incurred on the relocation of our Ticona
    Kelsterbach plant was flat compared to 2008. See Note 28 to
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
    information regarding the Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax was down due to a
    drop in equity in net earnings of affiliates as compared to
    2008. Equity in net earnings of affiliates was lower in 2009
    primarily due to reduced earnings from our Advanced Engineered
    Materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased demand and a
    biennial shutdown at one of our affiliate’s plants.

Net sales decreased $71 million during 2009 when compared
    with 2008. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by
    decreased volume due to softening demand largely in tow with
    less significant decreases experienced in flake. Decreased
    volumes were primarily due to weakness in underlying demand
    resulting from the global economic downturn. The decrease in
    volume was partially offset by an increase in selling prices. A
    slightly unfavorable foreign currency impact also contributed to
    the decrease in net sales.

Operating profit increased from $190 million in 2008 to
    $231 million in 2009. Fixed cost reduction efforts,
    improved energy costs and a favorable currency impact on costs
    had a significant impact on the increase to operating profit.

Earnings from continuing operations before tax of
    $288 million increased from 2008 primarily due to the
    increase in operating profit and an increase in dividends from
    our China ventures of $10 million. Increased dividends are
    the result of increased volumes and higher prices, as well as
    efficiency improvements.

Net sales declined $432 million during 2009 compared to
    2008 primarily due to the sale of our PVOH business and lower
    demand due to the economic downturn. The decline in our
    emulsions volumes was concentrated in North America and Europe,
    offset partially by volume increases in Asia. EVA Performance
    Polymers’ volumes declined due to the impact of the force
    majeure event at our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant which is
    offset in other charges in our Other Activities segment. Repairs
    to the plant were completed at the end of the second quarter
    2009 and normal operations have resumed. Both decreases in key
    raw material costs resulting in lower selling prices and
    unfavorable currency impacts also contributed to the decline in
    net sales for 2009 compared to 2008.

Operating profit increased $42 million in 2009 compared to
    2008 as decreases in volume and selling prices were more than
    offset by lower raw material and energy costs and reduced
    overall spending. Reduced spending is attributable to our fixed
    spending reduction efforts, restructuring efficiencies and
    favorable foreign currency impacts on costs. Energy is favorable
    due to lower natural gas costs and lower usage resulting from a
    decline in volumes. Our EVA Performance Polymers business
    contributed to the increase in Other (charges) gains, net as a
    result of receiving $10 million in insurance recoveries in
    partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the force
    majeure event at our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant. The gain
    on the sale of our PVOH business of $34 million had a
    significant impact to the increase in operating profit.
    Depreciation and amortization also had a favorable impact on
    operating profit due to the PVOH divestiture and the shutdown of
    our Warrington, UK emulsions facility.

Net sales decreased 33% during 2009 as compared to 2008
    primarily due to lower selling prices across all regions and
    major product lines, lower volumes and unfavorable foreign
    currency impacts. Lower volumes were driven by a reduction in
    underlying demand in Europe and in the Americas, which was only
    partially offset by significant increases in demand in Asia.
    Lower pricing was driven by lower raw material and energy
    prices, which also negatively impacted our formula-based pricing
    arrangements for VAM in the US. There were a number of
    production issues in Asia among the major acetic acid producers
    (other than Celanese), which coupled with planned outages,
    caused periodic and short-term market tightness.

Operating profit declined $212 million primarily as a
    result of lower prices across all regions and major product
    lines. Significantly lower realized pricing was partially offset
    by favorable raw material and energy prices, reduced spending
    due to the shutdown of our Pampa, Texas facility and other
    reductions in fixed spending. Depreciation and amortization
    expense declined primarily as a result of the long-lived asset
    impairment losses recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008
    related to our acetic acid and VAM production facility in
    Pardies, France, the closure of our VAM production unit in
    Cangrejera, Mexico in February 2009, together with lower
    depreciation expense resulting from the shutdown of our Pampa,
    Texas facility. Our operating profit was also negatively
    impacted by a $13 million increase in Other charges for
    2009 compared to 2008, relating primarily to the shutdown of our
    Pardies, France facility.

The decrease in earnings from continuing operations before tax
    of $210 million is consistent with the decline in operating
    profit.

Other
    Activities

Net sales remained flat in 2009 as compared to 2008. We do not
    expect third-party revenues from our captive insurance companies
    to increase significantly in the near future.

The operating loss for Other Activities increased from an
    operating loss of $138 million in 2008 to an operating loss
    of $160 million in 2009. The increase was primarily related
    to higher other charges. The increase in other charges was
    related to insurance retention costs as a result of our force
    majeure event at our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada plant which is
    offset in our Industrial Specialties segment and severance costs
    as a result of business optimization and finance improvement
    initiatives. The increase in other charges was partially offset
    by lower selling, general and administrative expenses primarily
    attributable to our fixed spending reduction efforts and
    restructuring efficiencies.



The loss from continuing operations before tax decreased
    $11 million in 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was
    primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from lower
    interest rates on our senior credit facilities and favorable
    currency impact.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from
    operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends
    from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, as of
    December 31, 2010 we have $145 million available for
    borrowing under our credit-linked revolving facility and
    $600 million available under our revolving credit facility
    to assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and
    other contractual obligations. We have 17 lenders who
    participate in our revolving credit facility, each with a
    commitment of not more than 10% of the $600 million
    commitment.

While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service
    requirements over the next several years are significant, we
    continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our
    liquidity requirements, including debt service, in 2011. If our
    cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt
    service and other obligations, we may be required to use other
    means available to us such as increasing our borrowings,
    reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional
    capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
    There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to
    generate cash flows at or above current levels.

In January 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Celanese Far East
    Limited, signed letters of intent to construct and operate
    industrial ethanol production facilities in Nanjing, China, at
    the Nanjing Chemical Industrial Park, and in Zhuhai, China, at
    the Gaolan Port Economic Zone. Pending project approvals, we
    could begin industrial ethanol production within the next
    30 months with expected nameplate capacity of 400,000 tons
    per year per plant with an initial investment of approximately
    $300 million per plant. We are pursuing approval at two
    locations to ensure our ability to effectively grow with future
    demand.

In April 2010, we announced that, through our strategic venture
    Ibn Sina, we will construct a 50,000 ton POM production facility
    in Saudi Arabia. Our pro rata share of invested capital in the
    POM expansion is expected to total approximately
    $165 million over a three year period which began in late
    2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred
    $2 million of capital expenditures. We anticipate related
    cash outflows for capital expenditures in 2011 will be
    $10 million.

Cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be
    approximately $350 million in 2011, excluding amounts
    related to the relocation of our Ticona plant in Kelsterbach and
    capacity expansion in Europe. Per the terms of our agreement
    with Fraport, we expect to receive the final cash installment of
    €110 million in 2011 subject to downward adjustments
    based on our readiness to close our operations at our
    Kelsterbach, Germany facility. As the relocation project
    progressed, we decided to expand the scope of the new production
    facilities and now expect to spend in excess of total proceeds
    to be received from Fraport. We anticipate related cash outflows
    for capital expenditures in 2011 will be €186 million.

In December 2009, we announced plans with China National Tobacco
    to expand our acetate flake and tow capacity at our Nantong
    facility. During 2010 we received formal approval to expand
    flake and tow capacities, each by 30,000 tons. Our Chinese
    acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash
    flow. We made contributions during 2010 of $12 million and
    have committed to contributions of $17 million in 2011
    related to the capacity expansion in Nantong.

As a result of the planned closure of our acetate flake and tow
    manufacturing operations at the Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom
    site, we expect to record total expenses of approximately $35 to
    $45 million, consisting of approximately $20 million
    for personnel-related exit costs and approximately
    $20 million of other facility-related shutdown costs such
    as contract termination costs and accelerated depreciation of
    fixed assets. We expect that substantially all of the exit costs
    (except for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets of
    approximately $15 million) will result in future cash
    expenditures. Cash outflows are expected to occur through 2011.
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded exit
    costs of $15 million related to personnel-related costs and
    $6 million related



to accelerated depreciation. See Note 4 and Note 17 to
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
    information.

In addition to exit-related costs associated with the closure of
    the Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom acetate flake and tow
    manufacturing operations, we expect to incur capital
    expenditures of approximately $35 million in certain
    capacity and efficiency improvements, principally at our
    Lanaken, Belgium facility, to optimize our global production
    network.

On a stand-alone basis, Celanese has no material assets other
    than the stock of its subsidiaries and no independent external
    operations of its own. As such, Celanese generally will depend
    on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay
    dividends and make other distributions to Celanese in order for
    Celanese to meet its obligations, including its obligations
    under its Series A common stock, senior credit facilities
    and senior notes.

Cash
    Flows

Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2010 were
    $740 million, which was a decrease of $514 million
    from December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents as of
    December 31, 2009 were $1,254 million, which was an
    increase of $578 million from December 31, 2008.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased
    $144 million to a cash inflow of $452 million in 2010
    from a cash inflow of $596 million for the same period in
    2009. The increase in trade working capital and the increases in
    cash paid for taxes and legal settlements, which negatively
    affected cash provided by operating activities, more than offset
    the increase in earnings and the increase in cash from our
    foreign currency hedges.

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased
    $10 million to a cash inflow of $596 million in 2009
    from a cash inflow of $586 million for the same period in
    2008. Operating cash flows were favorably impacted by less cash
    paid for interest, taxes, and legal settlements coupled with a
    favorable change in trade working capital which helped to offset
    lower operating performance.

Net Cash
    Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities

Net cash from investing activities decreased from a cash inflow
    of $31 million in 2009 to a cash outflow of
    $560 million for the same period in 2010. The decrease is
    primarily related to the receipt of proceeds of
    $412 million related to the Ticona Kelsterbach plant
    relocation and the receipt of $168 million for the sale of
    our PVOH business that were both received in 2009. There were no
    such proceeds in 2010. Adding to the decrease was cash outflows
    of $46 million incurred in 2010 related to our acquisition
    of two product lines,
    Zenite

®

LCP and
    Thermx

®

PCT, from DuPont Performance Polymers as compared to the cash
    outflows for our FACT business acquired in 2009 which were only
    $8 million.

Net cash from investing activities increased from a cash outflow
    of $201 million in 2008 to a cash inflow of
    $31 million in 2009. Net cash from investing activities
    increased primarily due to lower capital expenditures on
    property, plant and equipment, proceeds received from the sale
    of our PVOH business and increased deferred proceeds received on
    our Ticona Kelsterbach relocation. These cash inflows were
    offset slightly by in increase on our capital expenditures
    related to our Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation.

Our cash outflows for capital expenditures were
    $201 million, $176 million and $274 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, excluding amounts related to the relocation of our
    Ticona plant in Kelsterbach. Capital expenditures were primarily
    related to major replacements of equipment, capacity expansions,
    major investments to reduce future operating costs and
    environmental and health and safety initiatives. Cash outflows
    for capital expenditures for our Ticona plant in Kelsterbach
    were €236 million for the year ended December 31,
    2010.



Net Cash
    Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities increased from a cash
    outflow of $112 million in 2009 to a cash outflow of
    $388 million for the same period in 2010. The
    $276 million increase primarily relates to the net pay down
    on long-term debt of $297 million and $48 million used
    to repurchase shares of the Company’s Series A common
    stock.

Net cash for financing activities decreased from a cash outflow
    of $499 million in 2008 to a cash outflow of
    $112 million in 2009. The $387 million decrease in
    cash used in financing activities primarily related to cash
    outflows attributable to the repurchase of shares during 2008 of
    $378 million as compared to no shares repurchased during
    2009.

In addition, exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents
    was an unfavorable currency effect of $18 million in 2010
    compared to a favorable impact of $63 million in 2009 and
    an unfavorable impact of $35 million in 2008.

Debt
    and Other Obligations

Senior
    Notes

On September 24, 2010, we completed an offering of
    $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6
    5/8% Senior Notes due 2018 (the “Notes”). The
    Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Celanese US and rank
    equally in right of payment and other subordinated indebtedness
    of Celanese US. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured
    basis by Celanese and each of the domestic subsidiaries of
    Celanese US that guarantee its obligations under its senior
    secured credit facilities (the “Subsidiary
    Guarantors”).

The Notes were issued under an indenture dated as of
    September 24, 2010 (the “Indenture”) among
    Celanese US, Celanese, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Wells Fargo
    Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Notes bear interest
    at a rate of 6 5/8% per annum and were priced at 100% of par.
    Celanese US will pay interest on the Notes on April 15 and
    October 15 of each year commencing on April 15, 2011. The
    Notes will mature on October 15, 2018. The Notes are
    redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after
    October 15, 2014 at the redemption prices specified in the
    Indenture. Prior to October 15, 2014, Celanese US may
    redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of 100% of
    the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
    to the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium as
    specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains covenants, including, but not limited to,
    restrictions on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
    ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge,
    consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other
    restricted payments; engage in transactions with affiliates; or
    engage in other businesses.

Senior
    Credit Agreement

On September 29, 2010, we entered into an amendment
    agreement with the lenders under our existing senior secured
    credit facilities in order to amend and restate the
    corresponding credit agreement, dated as of April 2, 2007
    (as previously amended, the “Existing Credit
    Agreement”, and as amended and restated by the amendment
    agreement, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). Our
    Amended Credit Agreement consists of the Term C loan facility
    having principal amounts of $1,140 million of US
    dollar-denominated and €204 million of
    Euro-denominated term loans due 2016, the Term B loan facility
    having principal amounts of $417 million US
    dollar-denominated and €69 million of Euro-denominated
    term loans due 2014, a $600 million revolving credit
    facility terminating in 2015 and a $228 million
    credit-linked revolving facility terminating in 2014. Prior to
    entering into the Amendment Agreement, we used the proceeds from
    the offering of the Notes along with $200 million of cash
    on hand to pay down the Term B loan facility borrowings under
    the Existing Credit Agreement. See Note 13 to the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
    information regarding our senior credit facilities.



As of December 31, 2010, the balances available for
    borrowing under the revolving credit facility and the
    credit-linked revolving facility are as follows:

    day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial
    statements have been delivered under the revolving facility)
    cannot exceed the threshold as specified below. Further, our
    first lien senior secured leverage ratio must be maintained at
    or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding under
    the revolving credit facility.

Our amended maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratios,

    Agreement, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our
    ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge,
    consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other
    restricted payments; make investments; prepay or modify certain
    indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into
    sale-leaseback transactions or hedge transactions; or engage in
    other businesses; as well as a covenant requiring maintenance of
    a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio.

We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our
    debt agreements as of December 31, 2010.

Commitments
    Relating to Share Capital

We have a policy of declaring, subject to legally available
    funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share of Series A
    common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. In April 2010, we
    announced that our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in
    the Celanese quarterly Series A common stock cash dividend.
    The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend rate
    from $0.04 to $0.05 per share of Series A common stock on a
    quarterly basis, which equates to $0.16 to $0.20 per share of
    Series A common stock annually. The new dividend rate was
    applicable to dividends payable beginning in August 2010. For
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid
    $28 million, $23 million and $24 million,
    respectively, in cash dividends on our Series A common
    stock. On January 6, 2011, we declared an $8 million
    cash dividend which was paid on February 1, 2011.

In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $400 million of our Series A
    common stock. This authorization was increased to
    $500 million in October 2008. The authorization gives
    management discretion in determining the conditions under which
    shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not



have an expiration date. The number or shares repurchased and
    the average purchase price paid per share pursuant to this
    authorization are as follows:

    interest payments on long-term debt. Future interest expense is
    calculated using the rate in effect on December 31, 2010.

Contractual
    Guarantees and Commitments

As of December 31, 2010, we have current standby letters of
    credit of $83 million and bank guarantees of
    $10 million outstanding which are irrevocable obligations
    of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the
    event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance
    with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote
    that material payments will be required under these agreements.
    In addition, the senior notes issued by Celanese US are
    guaranteed by Celanese and certain domestic subsidiaries of
    Celanese US. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements for a description of this guarantee and the
    guarantees under our senior credit facility.

See Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection
    and application of significant accounting policies. The
    preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US
    GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
    the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated charges
    during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any
    reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in
    materially different results.

We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are
    critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present
    in the current economic environment. These matters, and the
    judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential
    to understanding our reported and future operating results. See
    Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion of our significant accounting
    policies.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

We test for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level.
    Our reporting units are either our operating business segments
    or one level below our operating business segments where
    discrete financial information is available for our reporting
    units and operating results are regularly reviewed by business
    segment management. Our business units have been designated as
    our reporting units based on business segment management’s
    review of and reliance



on the business unit financial information and include Advanced
    Engineered Materials, Acetate Products, Nutrinova, Emulsions,
    Celanese EVA Performance Polymers (formerly AT Plastics) and
    Acetyl Intermediates businesses. We assess the recoverability of
    the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our
    fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
    may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of goodwill and
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured using a
    discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates
    commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit.
    Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in
    impairment testing in the absence of available transactional
    market evidence to determine the fair value.

The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation
    model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow
    projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth
    rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and
    susceptible to change as they require significant management
    judgment. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted
    average cost of capital (“WACC”). The WACC considers
    market and industry data as well as company-specific risk
    factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate
    discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each
    reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would
    expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational
    management, considering industry and company-specific historical
    and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow
    projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate
    determination follows common methodology of capturing the
    present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last
    projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term
    growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the
    current carrying value, impairment of the reporting unit may
    exist. If the recoverability test indicates potential
    impairment, we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for
    the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is
    determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in
    a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill
    exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting
    unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill
    assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of
    the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the
    carrying value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying
    value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate
    certain long-lived and amortizable intangible assets associated
    with the reporting unit may require additional impairment
    testing.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing
    the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair
    value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The relief
    from royalty method estimates the Company’s theoretical
    royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key
    assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty
    rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates.
    Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales
    projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible
    to change as they require significant management judgment.
    Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the
    WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk
    factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are
    periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants.
    Operational management, considering industry and
    company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth
    rates and sales projections associated with each
    indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal value rate
    determination follows common methodology of capturing the
    present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last
    projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term
    growth rates.

For all significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded the
    carrying value of the asset by a substantial margin at the date
    of the most recent impairment test. Our methodology for
    determining impairment for both goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets was consistent with that used in the prior
    year.

Recoverability
    of Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets

We assess the recoverability of long-lived and amortizable
    intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples
    of a change in events or circumstances include, but are not
    limited to, a decrease in the market price of the asset, a
    history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is



being used. To assess the recoverability of long-lived and
    amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of
    the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash
    flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.
    Long-lived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for
    recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest
    level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent
    of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If such
    assets are considered impaired, the impairment recognized is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the fair value of the asset.

The development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections
    require management projections related to sales and
    profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset.
    Projections of sales and profitability trends are the
    assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they
    require significant management judgment. These projections are
    consistent with projections we use to manage our operations
    internally. When impairment is indicated, a discounted cash flow
    valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the
    reporting unit level, incorporating discount rates commensurate
    with risks associated with each asset, is used to determine the
    fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment. We
    believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market
    participant would have used in calculating fair value.

Valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible, amortizable intangible and
    long-lived assets for impairment were consistent with prior
    periods. We periodically engage third-party valuation
    consultants to assist us with this process. Specific assumptions
    discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider
    current industry and company-specific risk factors from the
    perspective of a market participant. The current business
    environment is subject to evolving market conditions and
    requires significant management judgment to interpret the
    potential impact to the Company’s assumptions. To the
    extent that changes in the current business environment result
    in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may occur
    in future periods.

Income Taxes

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance if needed based on
    historical taxable income, projected future taxable income,
    applicable tax planning strategies, and the expected timing of
    the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation
    allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
    portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
    In forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred
    tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax
    attribute carryforwards, we give weight to positive and negative
    evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can
    be objectively verified. We attach the most weight to historical
    earnings due to its verifiable nature. Weight is attached to tax
    planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible
    and implementable without significant obstacles. Less weight is
    attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective
    nature, and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary
    differences is given little weight unless the reversal of
    taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide. Valuation
    allowances have been established primarily on net operating loss
    carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the US,
    Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Spain, China, the United
    Kingdom and Canada. We have appropriately reflected increases
    and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall
    weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by
    jurisdiction basis. In 2009, based on cumulative profitability,
    the Company concluded that the US valuation allowance should be
    reversed except for a portion related to certain federal and
    state net operating loss carryforwards that are not likely to be
    realized.

We record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that
    may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax
    authorities. We recognize tax benefits when it is more likely
    than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical
    merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.
    Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are
    measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest
    amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
    realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of
    judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that
    position evaluated in light of all available evidence.

The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition
    and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to
    various assumptions and management judgment. If actual results
    differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or
    maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets,
    the resulting change in the valuation



allowance would generally impact earnings or Other comprehensive
    income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax
    asset. In addition, the positions taken with regard to tax
    contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax
    authorities which may result in future taxes, interest and
    penalties.

•

Benefit Obligations

We have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering
    substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements.
    With respect to its US qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    minimum funding requirements are determined by the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006 based on years of service

and/or

compensation. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of
    the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These
    assumptions include the weighted average discount rate,
    compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan
    assets and trends in health care costs. In addition to the above
    mentioned assumptions, actuarial consultants use factors such as
    withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit
    obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially
    from actual results due to changing market and economic
    conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or
    shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result
    in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense
    recorded in future periods.

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements
    related to pension and other postretirement benefits are
    determined on an actuarial basis. A significant assumption used
    in determining our pension expense is the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. As of December 31, 2010, we
    assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of
    8.5% for the US defined benefit pension plans, which represent
    approximately 82% and 85% of our fair value of pension plan
    assets and projected benefit obligation, respectively. On
    average, the actual return on the US qualified defined pension
    plans’ assets over the long-term (20 years) has
    exceeded 8.5%.

We estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected
    long-term rate of return for the US qualified defined benefit
    pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated
    $5 million in 2011. Another estimate that affects our
    pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount
    rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and
    other postretirement benefit plan obligations. At the end of
    each year, we determine the appropriate discount rate, used to
    determine the present value of future cash flows currently
    expected to be required to settle the pension and other
    postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is
    generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate
    fixed-income securities. As of December 31, 2010, we
    decreased the discount rate to 5.30% from 5.90% as of
    December 31, 2009 for the US plans. We estimate that a
    50 basis point decline in our discount rate will increase
    our annual pension expenses by an estimated $6 million, and
    increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $146 million for our US pension plans. In addition, the
    same basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase
    our annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than
    $1 million and $9 million respectively, for our US
    postretirement medical plans. We estimate that a 50 basis
    point decline in the discount rate for the non-US pension and
    postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other
    postretirement benefit annual expenses by approximately
    $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and
    will increase our benefit obligations by approximately
    $32 million and $2 million, respectively.

Other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life
    insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service
    requirements. The key determinants of the accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) are the
    discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate. The healthcare
    cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts
    of APBO and related expense. For example, increasing or
    decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage
    point in each year would result in the APBO as of
    December 31, 2010 increasing by approximately
    $4 million and decreasing by $4 million, respectively.
    Additionally, increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend
    rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the
    2010 postretirement benefit cost changing by less than
    $1 million.

Pension assumptions are reviewed annually on a plan and
    country-specific basis by third-party actuaries and senior
    management. Such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to
    reflect changes in market rates and outlook. We determine the
    long-term expected rate of return on plan assets by considering
    the current target asset allocation, as well as the historical
    and expected rates of return on various asset categories in
    which the plans are invested. A single long-term expected rate
    of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the
    weighted average of the



target asset allocation and the long-term expected rate of
    return assumptions for each asset category within each plan.

Differences between actual rates of return of plan assets and
    the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets are
    generally not recognized in pension expense in the year that the
    difference occurs. These differences are deferred and amortized
    into pension expense over the average remaining future service
    of employees. We apply the long-term expected rate of return on
    plan assets to a market-related value of plan assets to
    stabilize variability in the plan asset values.

Accounting for Commitments and Contingencies

We are subject to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits,
    claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of
    our business, relating to and including product liability,
    patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
    antitrust, past waste disposal practices, release of chemicals
    into the environment and employment matters, which are handled
    and defended in the ordinary course of business. We routinely
    assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
    these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably
    estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by
    us after considering a broad range of information including:
    notifications, demands, settlements which have been received
    from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates
    performed by independent consultants and outside counsel,
    available facts, identification of other potentially responsible
    parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior
    experience. With respect to environmental remediation
    liabilities, it is our policy to accrue through fifteen years,
    unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend
    beyond fifteen years. A determination of the amount of loss
    contingency required, if any, is assessed in accordance with
    FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”)
    Topic 450,

Contingencies,

and recorded if probable and
    estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter. The
    required reserves may change in the future due to new
    developments in each matter and as additional information
    becomes available.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
    Risks

Our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
    Exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety
    of techniques, including use of derivatives. We have in place
    policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates,
    interest rates and commodity prices as described below.
    Contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under
    FASB ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

(“FASB
    ASC Topic 815”).

See Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion of our market risk management
    and the related impact on our financial position and results of
    operations.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate
    risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of
    borrowing. To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our
    variable rate debt, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to
    convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate
    obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are designated
    as cash flow hedges.

In August 2010, we executed a forward-starting interest rate
    swap with a notional amount of $1.1 billion. As a result of
    the swap, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of $1.1 billion
    of the Company’s floating rate debt at 1.7125% effective
    January 2, 2012 through January 2, 2014.

As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.6 billion,
    €296 million and CNY 1.5 billion of variable rate
    debt, of which $1.5 billion and €150 million is
    hedged with interest rate swaps, which leaves $73 million,
    €146 million and CNY 1.5 billion of variable rate
    debt subject to interest rate exposure. Accordingly, a 1%
    increase in interest rates would increase annual interest
    expense by approximately $5 million.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

The primary business objective of this hedging program is to
    maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign
    currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from
    exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are
    minimized. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and
    to conduct operations either within functional currencies or
    using the protection of hedge strategies. Accordingly, we enter
    into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our
    exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. From time to time we
    may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted
    transactions. Forward contracts are not designated as hedges
    under FASB ASC Topic 815.



The following table indicates the total US dollar equivalents of
    net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign
    exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency. All of the
    contracts included in the table below will have approximately
    offsetting effects from actual underlying payables, receivables,
    intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to
    foreign exchange remeasurement.

Additionally, a portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
    Fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the US
    dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and
    financial results. For example, a decline in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar results in a decline in the US dollar
    value of our sales and earnings denominated in Euros due to
    translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the
    Euro versus the US dollar would result in an opposite effect.

In 2009, we dedesignated the foreign currency exposure created
    by the Euro-denominated term loan which is expected to offset
    the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans,
    decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and
    reducing our exposure to external counterparties.

Commodity
    Risk Management

We have exposure to the prices of commodities in our procurement
    of certain raw materials. We manage our exposure to commodity
    risk primarily through the use of long-term supply agreements,
    multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase
    agreements. We regularly assess our practice of purchasing a
    portion of our commodity requirements under forward purchase
    agreements and other raw material hedging instruments in
    accordance with changes in market conditions. Forward purchases
    and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled
    through actual delivery of the physical commodity. For
    qualifying contracts, we have elected to apply the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception of FASB ASC Topic 815 based
    on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of
    the contract that we would not settle net and the transaction
    would settle by physical delivery of the commodity. As such,
    realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
    cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

In addition, we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to
    hedge a component of a raw material or energy source. Typically,
    these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
    These instruments are marked to market at each reporting period
    and gains (losses) are included in Cost of sales in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We
    recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. As of
    December 31, 2010, we did not have any open financial
    derivative contracts for commodities.

. All amounts in the table above have been
    properly adjusted for the effects of discontinued operations and
    the Ibn Sina accounting change described below.

Ibn
    Sina

We indirectly own a 25% interest in Ibn Sina through CTE
    Petrochemicals Company (“CTE”), a venture with Texas
    Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. (which also indirectly owns
    25%). The remaining interest in Ibn Sina is held by Saudi Basic
    Industries Corporation (“SABIC”). SABIC and CTE
    entered into the Ibn Sina joint venture agreement in 1981. In
    April 2010, we announced that Ibn Sina will construct a 50,000
    ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia and that the term of
    the joint venture agreement was extended until 2032. Ibn
    Sina’s existing natural gas supply contract expires in
    2022. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our indirect
    economic interest in Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to 32.5%.
    SABIC’s economic interest will remain unchanged.

In connection with this transaction, we reassessed the factors
    surrounding the accounting method for this investment and
    changed from the cost method of accounting for investments to
    the equity method of accounting for investments beginning
    April 1, 2010. Financial information relating to this
    investment for periods prior to 2010 has been retrospectively
    adjusted to apply the equity method of accounting.

    Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(b)

as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based
    on that evaluation, as of December 31, 2010, the Chief

    that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the three months ended December 31, 2010, there were
    no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the
    Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
    our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable
    assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are
    made in accordance with management authorization; and providing
    reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
    disposition of company assets that could have a material effect
    on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting is not intended to
    provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our
    consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2010. KPMG LLP has audited
    this assessment of our internal control over financial
    reporting; its report is included below.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying report of management on internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Celanese Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Celanese Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010.
    These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 11, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Staff Position No. 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets

(included in FASB Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) Subtopic

715-20,

Defined Benefit Plans

), during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted FASB Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(included in FASB ASC Subtopic

820-10,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

), during the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

    endeavors to describe those contracts or agreements that are
    material to its business, results of operations or financial
    position. The Company may also describe some arrangements that
    are not material but which the Company believes investors may
    have an interest in or which may have been subject to a

Form 8-K

filing. Investors should not assume the Company has described
    all contracts and agreements relative to the Company’s
    business in this Annual Report.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

•

Consolidation principles

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with US GAAP for all periods presented and include
    the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries
    over which the Company exercises control. All significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

•

Estimates and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
    the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues, expenses and allocated charges
    during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to
    impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived
    assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and
    other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other
    postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations,
    environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

•

Cash and cash equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered cash equivalents.



•

Inventories

Inventories, including stores and supplies, are stated at the
    lower of cost or market. Cost for inventories is determined
    using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost includes raw
    materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost for
    stores and supplies is primarily determined by the average cost
    method.

•

Investments in marketable securities

The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity
    securities as

“available-for-sale”

and reports those investments at their fair market values in the
    consolidated balance sheets as Marketable Securities, at fair
    value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the related tax effect
    on

available-for-sale

securities, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
    component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    until realized. The cost of securities sold is determined by
    using the specific identification method.

A decline in the market value of any

available-for-sale

security below cost that is deemed to be

other-than-temporary

results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The
    impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the
    security is established. To determine whether impairment is

other-than-temporary,

the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to
    hold the investment until a market price recovery and evidence
    indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs
    evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment
    includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and
    duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year
    end and forecasted performance of the investee.

•

Investments in affiliates

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 323,

Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures

(“FASB ASC Topic 323”), stipulates that the equity
    method should be used to account for investments whereby an
    investor has “the ability to exercise significant influence
    over operating and financial policies of an investee”, but
    does not exercise control. FASB ASC Topic 323 generally
    considers an investor to have the ability to exercise
    significant influence when it owns 20% or more of the voting
    stock of an investee. In certain instances, the financial
    information of the Company’s equity investees is not
    available timely. Accordingly, the Company records its
    proportional share of the investee’s earnings or losses on
    a consistent lag of no more than one quarter. FASB ASC Topic 323
    lists circumstances under which, despite 20% ownership, an
    investor may not be able to exercise significant influence.
    Certain investments where the Company owns greater than a 20%
    ownership and cannot exercise significant influence or control
    are accounted for under the cost method of accounting
    (Note 8).

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    its investments whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline.
    A loss in value of an equity method or cost method investment
    which is other than a temporary decline will be recognized as
    the difference between the carrying amount of the investment and
    its fair value.

The Company’s estimates of fair value are determined based
    on a discounted cash flow model. The Company periodically
    engages third-party valuation consultants to assist with this
    process.

•

Property, plant and equipment, net

Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings, machinery and
    equipment, including capitalized interest, and property under
    capital lease agreements, are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. The Company records depreciation and amortization
    in its consolidated statements of operations as either Cost of
    sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses consistent
    with the utilization of the underlying assets. Depreciation is
    calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated
    useful lives of depreciable assets:

Land improvements

20 years

Buildings and improvements

30 years

Machinery and equipment

20 years



Leasehold improvements are amortized over ten years or the
    remaining life of the respective lease, whichever is shorter.

Accelerated depreciation is recorded when the estimated useful
    life is shortened. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs,
    including costs for planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not
    extend the useful life of the asset are charged to earnings as
    incurred. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and
    depreciation accounts until sold or otherwise disposed. In the
    case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed
    from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from
    disposal, are included in earnings.

The Company also leases property, plant and equipment under
    operating and capital leases. Rent expense for operating leases,
    which may have escalating rentals or rent holidays over the term
    of the lease, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
    lease term. Amortization of capital lease assets is included as
    a component of depreciation expense.

Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their
    fair values and depreciated over the assets’ remaining
    useful lives or the Company’s policy lives, whichever is
    shorter.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount
    of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would
    be assessed when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from
    the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than
    the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have
    identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other
    asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the
    excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair
    value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or
    independent appraisals, as appropriate. Impairment losses are
    recorded primarily to Other (charges) gains, net.

•

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangible assets
    and other intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The
    excess of the purchase price over fair value of net identifiable
    assets and liabilities of an acquired business
    (“goodwill”) and other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment, at
    least annually. The Company tests for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment during the third
    quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
    goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill
    of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability
    is measured at the reporting unit level based on the provisions
    of FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles — Goodwill and
    Other

(“FASB ASC Topic 350”). The Company
    periodically engages third-party valuation consultants to assist
    with this process. Impairment losses are recorded primarily to
    Other (charges) gains, net.

Recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured
    using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates
    commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a
    Level 3 measurement under FASB ASC Topic 820,

Fair
    Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“FASB ASC Topic
    820”). The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow
    valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow
    projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth
    rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and
    susceptible to change as they require significant management
    judgment. If the calculated fair value is less than the current
    carrying value, impairment of the reporting unit may exist. When
    the recoverability test indicates potential impairment, the
    Company, or in certain circumstances, a third-party valuation
    consultant, will calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for
    the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is
    determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in
    a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill
    exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting
    unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill
    assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of
    the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded to write



down the carrying value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the
    carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may
    indicate certain long-lived and amortizable intangible assets
    associated with the reporting unit may require additional
    impairment testing.

The Company assesses recoverability of other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the indefinite-lived intangible asset may not be fully
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset over its
    fair value. Any excess of the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value is
    recognized as an impairment loss. The Company periodically
    engages third-party valuation consultants to assist with this
    process. Impairment losses are recorded primarily to Other
    (charges) gains, net.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing
    the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair
    value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset which is
    classified as a Level 3 measurement under FASB ASC Topic
    820. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company’s
    theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible
    asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount
    rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and
    terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth
    rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive
    and susceptible to change as they require significant management
    judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated
    by the weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”)
    considering any differences in company-specific risk factors.
    Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically
    substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. Operational
    management, considering industry and company-specific historical
    and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections
    associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal
    value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing
    the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last
    projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term
    growth rates.

The Company assesses the recoverability of finite-lived
    intangible assets in the same manner as for property, plant and
    equipment as described above. Impairment losses are recorded
    primarily to Other (charges) gains, net.

•

Financial instruments

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FASB ASC Topic 820 for financial assets and liabilities. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company applied the provisions of FASB
    ASC Topic 820 for non-recurring fair value measurements of
    non-financial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill,
    indefinite-lived intangible assets, property, plant and
    equipment and asset retirement obligations. The adoptions of
    FASB ASC Topic 820 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. FASB ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, and increases
    disclosures surrounding fair value calculations.

The Company manages its exposures to currency exchange rates,
    interest rates and commodity prices through a risk management
    program that includes the use of derivative financial
    instruments (Note 21). The Company does not use derivative
    financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The fair
    value of all derivative instruments is recorded as assets or
    liabilities at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value
    of these instruments are reported in income or Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net, depending on the use of the
    derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

(“FASB ASC Topic 815”).

Gains and losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash
    flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net, to the extent the hedges are effective,
    until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings. To
    the extent effective, gains and losses on derivative and
    non-derivative instruments used as hedges of the Company’s
    net investment in foreign operations are recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), net as part of the foreign
    currency translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of
    cash flow hedges and hedges of net investment in foreign
    operations, if any, are recognized in earnings immediately.
    Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked to
    market at the end of each accounting period with the change in
    fair value recorded in earnings.



•

Concentrations of credit risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment
    by customers and counterparties. The creditworthiness of
    customers and counterparties is subject to continuing review,
    including the use of master netting agreements, where the
    Company deems appropriate. The Company minimizes concentrations
    of credit risk through its global orientation in diverse
    businesses with a large number of diverse customers and
    suppliers. In addition, credit risk arising from derivative
    instruments is not significant because the counterparties to
    these contracts are primarily major international financial
    institutions and, to a lesser extent, major chemical companies.
    Where appropriate, the Company has diversified its selection of
    counterparties. Generally, collateral is not required from
    customers and counterparties and allowances are provided for
    specific risks inherent in receivables.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. The Company believes, based on
    historical results, the likelihood of actual write-offs having a
    material impact on financial results is low. The allowance for
    doubtful accounts is estimated using factors such as customer
    credit ratings, past collection history and general risk
    profile. Receivables are charged against the allowance for
    doubtful accounts when it is probable that the receivable will
    not be recovered.

•

Deferred financing costs

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred to obtain debt
    financings and amortizes these costs using a method that
    approximates the effective interest rate method over the terms
    of the related debt. Upon the extinguishment of the related
    debt, any unamortized capitalized debt financing costs are
    immediately expensed.

•

Environmental liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical
    products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the
    production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling,
    processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials.
    The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating
    to environmental matters if available information indicates that
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of
    the site, the Company accrues through fifteen years, unless the
    Company has government orders or other agreements that extend
    beyond fifteen years. If the event of loss is neither probable
    nor reasonably estimable, but is reasonably possible, the
    Company provides appropriate disclosure in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements if the contingency is
    considered material. The Company estimates environmental
    liabilities on a

case-by-case

basis using the most current status of available facts, existing
    technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior
    experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of
    environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets
    when their receipt is deemed probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated
    site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of
    the following types of costs: site investigation and testing
    costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water
    contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation
    monitoring costs. These reserves do not take into account any
    claims or recoveries from insurance. There are no pending
    insurance claims for any environmental liability that are
    expected to be material. The measurement of environmental
    liabilities is based on the Company’s periodic estimate of
    what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the
    remediation effort. The Company utilizes third parties to assist
    in the management and development of cost estimates for its
    sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors
    affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the
    consolidated financial statements in the period in which they
    occur (Note 15).

•

Legal fees

The Company accrues for legal fees related to loss contingency
    matters when the costs associated with defending these matters
    can be reasonably estimated and are probable of occurring. All
    other legal fees are expensed as incurred.



•

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have
    been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment of products, and provided that four basic criteria are
    met: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    (b) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    (c) the fee is fixed or determinable; and
    (d) collectibility is reasonably assured. Should changes in
    conditions cause the Company to determine revenue recognition
    criteria are not met for certain transactions, revenue
    recognition would be delayed until such time that the
    transactions become realizable and fully earned. Payments
    received in advance of meeting the above revenue recognition
    criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.

•

Research and development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense
    in the period in which they are incurred.

•

Insurance loss reserves

The Company has two wholly-owned insurance companies (the
    “Captives”) that are used as a form of self insurance
    for property, liability and workers compensation risks. One of
    the Captives also insures certain third-party risks. The
    liabilities recorded by the Captives relate to the estimated
    risk of loss, which is based on management estimates and
    actuarial valuations, and unearned premiums, which represent the
    portion of the third-party premiums written applicable to the
    unexpired terms of the policies in-force. Liabilities are
    recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been
    developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and the
    Company can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition,
    liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure
    on both known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the
    liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly. It is possible
    that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded
    liabilities. Premiums written are recognized as revenue based on
    the terms of the policies. Capitalization of the Captives is
    determined by regulatory guidelines.

•

Reinsurance receivables

The Captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their
    risk of loss. The reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the
    Captives from their obligations to policyholders. Failure of the
    reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to
    the Captives. The Captives evaluate the financial condition of
    their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to
    minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
    insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed
    non-collectible.

•

Income taxes

The provision for income taxes has been determined using the
    asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
    Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
    effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
    amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and
    tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these
    temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are
    expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or
    the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and
    laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the
    balance sheet date.

The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax
    strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
    temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%) that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized.

The Company considers many factors when evaluating and
    estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require
    periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate
    actual outcomes. Tax positions are recognized only when it is
    more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the
    positions will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that
    meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are measured using a
    probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax
    benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon



settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition
    threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment
    based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position
    evaluated in light of all available evidence.

•

Noncontrolling interests

Noncontrolling interests in the equity and results of operations
    of the entities consolidated by the Company are shown as a
    separate line item in the consolidated financial statements.

•

Accounting for purchasing agent agreements

A subsidiary of the Company acts as a purchasing agent on behalf
    of the Company, as well as third parties. The entity arranges
    sale and purchase agreements for raw materials on a commission
    basis. Accordingly, the commissions earned on these third-party
    sales are classified as a reduction to Selling, general and
    administrative expenses.

•

Functional and reporting currencies

For the Company’s international operations where the
    functional currency is other than the US dollar, assets and
    liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates,
    while the statement of operations amounts are translated using
    the average exchange rates for the respective period.
    Differences arising from the translation of assets and
    liabilities in comparison with the translation of the previous
    periods or from initial recognition during the period are
    included as a separate component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net.

•

Reclassifications

The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to
    conform to the current year presentation.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2010, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards
    Updated (“ASU”)

2010-29,

Business Combinations: Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma
    Information for Business Combinations

(“ASU 2010-29”),

which amends FASB ASC Topic 805,

Business Combinations

.
    The update addresses diversity in the interpretation of the pro
    forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business
    combinations. If a public entity presents comparative financial
    statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of
    the combined entity as though the business combination that
    occurred during the current year had occurred as of the
    beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
    The Company adopted ASU

2010-29

on
    January 1, 2011. This update had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In December 2010, the FASB issued FASB ASU

2010-28,

Intangible – Goodwill and Other: When to Perform
    Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units
    with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts

(“ASU 2010-28”),

which amends FASB ASC Topic 350. The update modifies Step 1 of
    the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or
    negative carrying amounts. For these reporting units, an entity
    is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if
    it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
    The Company adopted ASU

2010-28

on
    January 1, 2011. This update had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In April 2010, the FASB issued FASB ASU

2010-17,

Revenue Recognition – Milestone Method: Milestone
    Method of Revenue Recognition

(“ASU

2010-17”),

which amends FASB ASC Topic 605,

Revenue
    Recognition – Milestone Method.

The update
    provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for
    determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition
    is appropriate for research or development transactions.
    Authoritative guidance on the use of the milestone method did
    not previously exist. The Company adopted ASU

2010-17

on
    January 1, 2011. This update had no impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.



In January 2010, the FASB issued FASB ASU

2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Improving
    Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

(“ASU

2010-06”),

which amends FASB ASC Topic 820. The update provides additional
    disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 and
    for activity in Level 3 and clarifies certain other
    existing disclosure requirements. The Company adopted ASU

2010-06

beginning January 15, 2010. This update had no impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Acquisitions,
    Dispositions, Ventures and Plant Closures

Acquisitions

In May 2010, the Company acquired two product lines,
    Zenite

®

liquid crystal polymer (“LCP”) and
    Thermx

®

polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate (“PCT”),
    from DuPont Performance Polymers. The acquisition will continue
    to build upon the Company’s position as a global supplier
    of high performance materials and technology-driven
    applications. These two product lines broaden the Company’s
    Ticona Engineering Polymers offerings within its Advanced
    Engineered Materials segment, enabling the Company to respond to
    a globalizing customer base, especially in the high growth
    electrical and electronics application markets. Pro forma
    financial information since the acquisition date has not been
    provided as the acquisition did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial information. The Company incurred
    $1 million in direct transaction costs as a result of this
    acquisition.

The Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to
    identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated
    fair values. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate
    fair values was recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets were
    valued using the relief from royalty and discounted cash flow
    methodologies which are considered a Level 3 measurement
    under FASB ASC Topic 820. The relief from royalty method
    estimates the Company’s theoretical royalty savings from
    ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this
    model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales
    projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty
    rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions
    most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require
    significant management judgment. The key assumptions used in the
    discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates,
    growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates.
    Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the
    most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require
    significant management judgment. The Company, with the
    assistance of third-party valuation consultants, calculated the
    fair value of the intangible assets acquired to allocate the
    purchase price at the respective acquisition date.

The consideration paid for the product lines and the amounts of
    the intangible assets acquired recognized at the acquisition
    date are as follows:

Weighted

Average Life

(In years)

(In $ millions)

In connection with the acquisition, the Company committed to
    purchase certain inventory at a future date valued at between
    $12 million and $17 million. During the three months
    ended December 31, 2010, the Company purchased
    $3 million of inventory in Europe and the US, leaving
    additional inventory of between $9 million and
    $14 million expected to be purchased in Asia during the
    first half of 2011.



In December 2009, the Company acquired the business and assets
    of FACT GmbH (Future Advanced Composites Technology)
    (“FACT”), a German company, for a purchase price of
    €5 million ($8 million). FACT is in the business
    of developing, producing and marketing long-fiber reinforced
    thermoplastics. As part of the acquisition, the Company has
    entered into a ten year lease agreement with the seller for the
    property and buildings on which the FACT business is located
    with the option to purchase the property at various times
    throughout the lease. The acquired business is included in the
    Advanced Engineered Materials segment.

Dispositions

In July 2009, the Company completed the sale of its polyvinyl
    alcohol (“PVOH”) business to Sekisui Chemical Co.,
    Ltd. (“Sekisui”) for a net cash purchase price of
    $168 million, resulting in a gain on disposition of
    $34 million. The net cash purchase price excludes the
    accounts receivable and payable retained by the Company. The
    transaction includes long-term supply agreements between Sekisui
    and the Company and therefore, does not qualify for treatment as
    a discontinued operation. The PVOH business is included in the
    Industrial Specialties segment.

Ventures

The Company indirectly owns a 25% interest in its National
    Methanol Company (“Ibn Sina”) affiliate through CTE
    Petrochemicals Company (“CTE”), a joint venture with
    Texas Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. (which also indirectly
    owns 25%). The remaining interest in Ibn Sina is held by Saudi
    Basic Industries Corporation (“SABIC”). SABIC and CTE
    entered into the Ibn Sina joint venture agreement in 1981. In
    April 2010, the Company announced that Ibn Sina will construct a
    50,000 ton polyacetal (“POM”) production facility in
    Saudi Arabia and that the term of the joint venture agreement
    was extended until 2032. Ibn Sina’s existing natural gas
    supply contract expires in 2022. Upon successful startup of the
    POM facility, the Company’s indirect economic interest in
    Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to 32.5%. SABIC’s economic
    interest will remain unchanged.

In connection with this transaction, the Company reassessed the
    factors surrounding the accounting method for this investment
    and changed from the cost method of accounting for investments
    to the equity method of accounting for investments beginning
    April 1, 2010. Financial information relating to this
    investment for prior periods has been retrospectively adjusted
    to apply the equity method of accounting. Effective
    April 1, 2010, the Company moved its investment in the Ibn
    Sina affiliate from its Acetyl Intermediates segment to its
    Advanced Engineered Materials segment to reflect the change in
    the affiliate’s business dynamics and growth opportunities
    as a result of the future construction of the POM facility.
    Business segment information for prior periods has been
    retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change and to conform
    to the current year presentation (Note 25).

Plant
    Closures

•

Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom

During the first quarter of 2010, the Company began to assess
    the possibility of consolidating its global acetate flake and
    tow manufacturing operations to strengthen the Company’s
    competitive position, reduce fixed costs and align future
    production capacities with anticipated industry demand trends.
    The assessment was also driven by a global shift in product
    consumption and included considering the probability of closing
    the Company’s acetate flake and tow manufacturing
    operations in Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom. Based on this
    assessment, the Company concluded that certain long-lived assets
    were partially impaired. Accordingly, in March 2010, the Company
    recorded long-lived asset impairment losses of $72 million
    (Note 17) to Other (charges) gains, net in the
    consolidated statements of operations. The Spondon, Derby,
    United Kingdom facility is included in the Consumer Specialties
    segment.

In April 2010, when the Company announced the proposed cessation
    of operations at the Spondon plant, the Company began the
    consulting process with employees and their representatives .
    These consultations did not result in a demonstrated basis for
    viable continuing operations for acetate flake and tow
    operations at the site. Accordingly, in August 2010, the Company
    announced that it will consolidate its global acetate
    manufacturing capabilities by closing its acetate flake and tow
    manufacturing operations in Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom, with
    operations expecting to cease in the latter part of 2011. The
    Company expects to serve its acetate customers under this
    proposal by optimizing its global production network, which
    includes facilities in Lanaken, Belgium; Narrows, Virginia; and
    Ocotlan, Mexico, as well as the Company’s acetate affiliate
    facilities in China.



The exit costs and plant shutdown costs recorded in the
    consolidated statements of operations related to the closure of
    the Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom location
    (Note 17) are as follows:

Pardies, France

In July 2009, the Company’s wholly-owned French subsidiary,
    Acetex Chimie S.A., completed the consultation process with the
    workers council on its “Project of Closure” and social
    plan related to the Company’s Pardies, France facility
    pursuant to which the Company ceased all manufacturing
    operations and associated activities in December 2009. The
    Company agreed with the workers council on a set of measures of
    assistance aimed at minimizing the effects of the plant’s
    closing on the Pardies workforce, including training,
    outplacement and severance. The Pardies, France facility is
    included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment.

Assets
    Held for Sale

Assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2010 include plant assets with a net book
    value of $9 million. The plant assets held for sale relate
    to an agreement reached in July 2007 with Babcock &
    Brown, a worldwide investment firm that specializes in real
    estate and utilities development, to sell the Company’s
    Pampa, Texas facility. The plant assets are included in the
    Acetyl Intermediates segment.



Assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2009 include an office building the Company
    sold during the year ended December 31, 2010. The office
    building had a net book value of $2 million and the Company
    recorded a gain of $14 million to Gain (loss) on
    disposition of businesses and assets, net, in the consolidated
    statements of operations during the year ended December 31,
    2010. The office building was included in the Other Activities

The Company reviews all investments for

other-than-temporary

impairment at least quarterly or as indicators of impairment
    exist. Indicators of impairment include the duration and
    severity of the decline in fair value below carrying value as
    well as the intent and ability to hold the investment to allow
    for a recovery in the market value of the investment. In
    addition, the Company considers qualitative factors that
    include, but are not limited to: (i) the financial
    condition and business plans of the investee including its
    future earnings potential, (ii) the investee’s credit
    rating, and (iii) the current and expected market and
    industry conditions in which the investee operates. If a decline
    in the fair value of an investment is deemed by management to be

other-than-temporary,

the Company writes down the carrying value of the investment to
    fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net
    earnings. Such a determination is dependent on the facts and
    circumstances relating to each investment. The Company
    recognized $0 million, $1 million and $0 million
    of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses related to equity securities in the
    consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

In connection with the Company’s annual goodwill impairment
    test performed during the three months ended September 30,
    2010 using June 30 balances, the Company did not record an
    impairment loss related to goodwill as the estimated fair value
    for each of the Company’s reporting units exceeded the
    carrying value of the underlying assets by a substantial margin.
    No events or changes in circumstances occurred during the three

    carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
    Accordingly, no additional impairment analysis was performed

The Company’s trademarks and trade names have an indefinite

    plant closures.

Included in the asset retirement obligations for each of the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is $10 million
    related to a business acquired in 2005. The Company has a
    corresponding receivable of $10 million included in
    noncurrent Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of
    December 31, 2010.

The Company concluded several sites no longer had an
    indeterminate life based on long-lived asset impairment
    triggering events and decisions made by the Company.
    Accordingly, the Company recorded asset retirement obligations
    associated with these sites. To measure the fair value of the
    asset retirement obligations, the Company uses the expected
    present value technique which is classified as a Level 3
    measurement under FASB ASC Topic 820. The expected present value
    technique uses a set of cash flows that represent the
    probability-weighted average of all possible cash flows based on
    the Company’s judgment. The Company uses the following
    inputs to determine the fair value of the asset retirement
    obligations based on the Company’s experience with
    fulfilling obligations of this type and the Company’s
    knowledge of market conditions: a) labor costs;
    b) allocation of overhead costs; c) profit on labor
    and overhead costs; d) effect of inflation on estimated
    costs and profits; e) risk premium for bearing the
    uncertainty inherent in cash flows, other than inflation;
    f) time value of money represented by the risk-free
    interest rate commensurate with the timing of the associated
    cash flows; and g) nonperformance risk relating to the
    liability which includes the Company’s own credit risk.

The Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement
    obligations related to certain of its existing operating
    facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include
    demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration
    activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the
    retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or
    abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company
    currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities
    indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value
    cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company
    considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites,
    an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time.
    If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset
    retirement obligations could significantly affect the
    Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

Senior
    Notes

On September 24, 2010, Celanese US completed an offering of
    $600 million in aggregate principal amount of

6 5/8%

Senior Notes due 2018 (the “Notes”) in a private
    placement conducted pursuant to Rule 144A under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
    Act”). The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis
    by Celanese and each of the domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US
    that guarantee its obligations under its senior secured credit
    facilities (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”).

The Notes were issued under an indenture dated
    September 24, 2010 (the “Indenture”) among
    Celanese US, Celanese, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Wells Fargo
    Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Notes bear interest
    at a rate of

6 5/8%

per annum and were priced at 100% of par. Celanese US will pay
    interest on the Notes on April 15 and October 15 of each year
    commencing on April 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on
    October 15, 2018 and the Notes are redeemable, in whole or
    in part, at any time on or after October 15, 2014 at the
    redemption prices specified in the Indenture. Prior to
    October 15, 2014, Celanese US may redeem some or all of the
    Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption
    date, plus a “make-whole” premium as specified in the
    Indenture. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of
    Celanese US and rank equally in right of payment with all other
    unsubordinated indebtedness of Celanese US.

The holders of the Notes are entitled to the benefits of a
    registration rights agreement dated September 24, 2010 (the
    “Registration Rights Agreement”), by and among
    Celanese US and the initial purchasers listed therein. Pursuant
    to the Registration Rights Agreement, Celanese US has agreed to
    use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration
    statement (an “Exchange Offer Registration Statement”)
    with respect to a registered exchange offer (an “Exchange
    Offer”) to exchange the Notes for new notes with terms
    substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes
    (except that the new notes will not have transfer restrictions,
    registration rights or be entitled to Additional



Interest (as defined below)), to cause the Exchange Offer
    Registration Statement to be declared effective by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act and
    to consummate the Exchange Offer by the 270th day after the
    date of the initial issuance of the Notes (June 21, 2011).

If, on or before the 270th day after the original issue
    date of the Notes, (a) Celanese US has not exchanged the
    new notes for all Notes validly tendered in accordance with the
    terms of an Exchange Offer or, if required, a shelf registration
    statement covering resales of the Notes has not been declared
    effective, or (b) a shelf registration statement covering
    resales of the Notes is required and becomes effective but such
    shelf registration statement ceases to be effective during the
    period specified in the Registration Rights Agreement (subject
    to certain exceptions) (each such event referred to in
    clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph, a
    “Registration Default”), then additional interest
    (“Additional Interest”) shall accrue on the
    outstanding principal amount of the Notes from and including the
    date on which such Registration Default has occurred at a rate
    of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 day period immediately
    following such date and will increase by an additional 0.25% per
    annum at the end of each subsequent 90 day period, up to a
    maximum rate of 1.00% per annum; provided, however, that
    Additional Interest will not accrue in respect of more than one
    Registration Default at any time. Additional Interest will cease
    to accrue upon the earliest to occur of (i) the date on
    which the Registration Default giving rise to such Additional
    Interest shall have been cured and (ii) the date that is
    the second anniversary of the closing date of the offering.

The Indenture contains covenants, including, but not limited to,
    restrictions on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
    ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge,
    consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other
    restricted payments; engage in transactions with affiliates; or
    engage in other businesses.

Senior
    Credit Facilities

On September 29, 2010, Celanese US, Celanese, and certain
    of the domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US entered into an
    amendment agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with
    the lenders under Celanese US’s existing senior secured
    credit facilities in order to amend and restate the
    corresponding Credit Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2007
    (as previously amended, the “Existing Credit
    Agreement”, and as amended and restated by the Amendment
    Agreement, the “Amended Credit Agreement”).

Prior to entering into the Amendment Agreement, Celanese US,
    through its subsidiaries, prepaid outstanding term loan
    borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement in an aggregate
    principal amount of $800 million using the proceeds from
    the issuance of the Notes and cash on hand. The prepaid
    principal amount was comprised of $649 million of US
    dollar-denominated term loan facility and €114 million
    of Euro-denominated term loan facility.

As part of the Amendment Agreement, $1,140 million of US
    dollar-denominated term loan facility and €204 million
    of Euro-denominated term loan facility under the Existing Credit
    Agreement were converted into the Term C loan facility having an
    extended maturity of October 31, 2016. The non-extended
    portions of the Term B loan facility were continued under the
    Amended Credit Agreement as the Term B loan facility, having
    principal amounts of $417 million and
    €69 million, respectively, without change to the
    maturity date of April 2, 2014. Additionally, Celanese US
    extended $600 million of revolving credit facility
    commitments to October 31, 2015. The maturity date of the
    revolving credit facility will be accelerated to January 1,
    2014 if, on such date, the aggregate principal amount of the
    Term B loan facility outstanding is $450 million or more.
    The maturity of the $228 million credit-linked revolving
    facility terminating in 2014 was not extended under the
    Amendment Agreement.

Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement will continue to
    bear interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR (for US
    dollars) or EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable, or, for US
    dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base
    rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable
    margin for the Term B loan facility and any borrowings under the
    credit-linked revolving facility is 1.75% above LIBOR or
    EURIBOR, as applicable, subject to reduction by 0.25% if the
    Company’s total net leverage ratio is 2.25:1.00 or less.
    The applicable margin for the Term C loan facility is 3.00%
    above LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable, subject to increase by
    0.25% if the Company’s total net leverage ratio is above
    2.25:1.00, and subject to reduction by 0.25% if the
    Company’s total net leverage ratio is 1.75:1.00 or less.
    The applicable margin for the Term B loan facility and any
    borrowings under the credit-linked revolving facility is 1.5% as
    of December 31, 2010. The applicable margin for the Term C
    loan facility is 3.0%, as of December 31, 2010. The
    applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility is currently 2.50% above LIBOR or EURIBOR, as
    applicable, subject to increase or reduction in certain
    circumstances based on changes in the Company’s corporate
    credit ratings. Term loan borrowings under the Amended Credit
    Agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the initial
    principal amount per annum, payable quarterly.

The Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese and
    certain domestic subsidiaries of Celanese US and is secured by a
    lien on substantially all assets of Celanese US and such
    guarantors, subject to certain agreed exceptions (including for
    certain real property and certain shares of foreign
    subsidiaries), pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral
    Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2007.



As a condition to borrowing funds or requesting that letters of
    credit be issued under the revolving facility, the
    Company’s first lien senior secured leverage ratio (as
    calculated as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter
    for which financial statements have been delivered under the
    revolving facility) cannot exceed the threshold as specified
    below. Further, the Company’s first lien senior secured
    leverage ratio must be maintained at or below that threshold
    while any amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit
    facility.

The Company’s amended maximum first lien senior secured
    leverage ratios, estimated first lien senior secured leverage
    ratios and the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit
    facility as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that are
    substantially similar to those found in the Existing Credit
    Agreement, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the
    Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur
    indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell
    assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make
    investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in
    transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback
    transactions or hedge transactions; or engage in other
    businesses.

The Amended Credit Agreement also maintains, from the Existing
    Credit Agreement, a number of events of default, including a
    cross default to other debt of Celanese, Celanese US, or their
    subsidiaries, including the Notes, in an aggregate amount equal
    to more than $40 million and the occurrence of a change of
    control. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the
    occurrence of any other event of default, could result in
    acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations
    under the Amended Credit Agreement.

As a result of the Amendment Agreement and the issuance of the
    Notes, the Company accelerated amortization of deferred
    financing costs of $8 million and incurred other
    refinancing expenses of $8 million which combined are
    recorded to Refinancing expense in the consolidated statements
    of operations. In addition, the Company recorded deferred
    financing costs of $7 million related to the Amendment
    Agreement and $9 million related to the issuance of the
    Notes. These deferred financing costs combined with existing
    deferred financing costs are included in noncurrent Other assets
    in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010.
    Deferred financing costs of $18 million and $9 million
    are being amortized over the terms of the Amendment Agreement
    and the Notes, respectively.

Amortization of deferred financing costs recorded in the
    consolidated statements of operations is as follows:

    Benefit Obligations

Pension obligations.

Pension obligations are
    established for benefits payable in the form of retirement,
    disability and surviving dependent pensions. The commitments
    result from participation in defined contribution and defined
    benefit plans, primarily in the US. Benefits are dependent on
    years of service and the employee’s compensation.
    Supplemental retirement benefits provided to certain employees
    are nonqualified for US tax purposes. Separate trusts have been
    established for some nonqualified plans. Pension costs under the
    Company’s retirement plans are actuarially determined.

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia. Independent trusts or insurance
    companies administer the majority of these plans.

The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North
    America, Europe and Asia covering certain employees. Employees
    may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these
    contributions in varying amounts. The Company’s matching
    contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on
    specified percentages of employee contributions.

The Company participates in multiemployer defined benefit
    pension plans in Europe covering certain employees. The
    Company’s contributions to the multiemployer defined
    benefit pension plans are based on specified percentages of
    employee contributions.

Contributions to the defined contribution plans and
    multiemployer defined benefit pension plans are as follows:

Year Ended December 31,




(In $ millions)

Defined contribution plans




Multiemployer defined benefit plans




Other postretirement obligations.

Certain retired
    employees receive postretirement healthcare and life insurance
    benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which has the
    right to modify or terminate these plans at any time. The cost
    for coverage is shared between the Company and the retiree. The
    cost of providing retiree health care and life insurance
    benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service
    period of the active employee group. The Company’s policy
    is to fund benefits as claims and premiums are paid. The US plan
    was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2006.



The following tables set forth the benefit obligations, the fair
    value of the plan assets and the funded status of the

Valuation

The Company uses the corridor approach in the valuation of its
    defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits. The
    corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses
    resulting from variances between actual results and economic
    estimates or actuarial assumptions. For defined benefit pension
    plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when
    the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the
    market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. For other
    postretirement benefits,



amortization occurs when the net gains and losses exceed 10% of
    the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the
    beginning of the year. The amount in excess of the corridor is
    amortized over the average remaining service period to
    retirement date for active plan participants or, for retired
    participants, the average remaining life expectancy.

The principal weighted-average assumptions used to determine
    benefit obligation are as follows:

The expected rate of return is assessed annually and is based on
    long-term relationships among major asset classes and the level
    of incremental returns that can be earned by the successful
    implementation of different active investment management
    strategies. Equity returns are based on estimates of long-term
    inflation rate, real rate of return,

10-year

Treasury bond premium over cash and equity risk premium. Fixed
    income returns are based on maturity, long-term inflation, real
    rate of return and credit spreads. The US qualified defined
    benefit plans’ actual return on assets for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 was 15% versus an expected long-term rate
    of asset return assumption of 8.5%.

In the US, the rate used to discount pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan liabilities was based on a yield
    curve developed from market data of over 300 Aa-grade
    non-callable bonds at December 31, 2010. This yield curve
    has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the
    obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension and
    other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding
    rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount
    rate.



The Company determines its discount rates in the Euro zone using
    the iBoxx Euro Corporate AA Bond indices with appropriate
    adjustments for the duration of the plan obligations. In other
    international locations, the Company determines its discount
    rates based on the yields of high quality government bonds with
    a duration appropriate to the duration of the plan obligations.

On January 1, 2010, the Company’s health care cost
    trend assumption for US postretirement medical plan’s net
    periodic benefit cost was 8.5% for the first year declining 0.5%
    per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. On January 1, 2009, the
    Company’s health care cost trend assumption for US
    postretirement medical plan’s net periodic benefit cost was
    9% for the first year declining 0.5% per year to an ultimate
    rate of 5%. On January 1, 2008, the Company’s health
    care cost trend assumption for US postretirement medical
    plan’s net periodic benefit cost was 9% for the first two
    years declining 0.5% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
    one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed health
    care cost trend rate would impact postretirement obligations by
    $4 million and $(4) million, respectively. The effect
    of a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care
    cost trend rate would have a less than $1 million impact on
    service and interest cost.

Plan
    Assets

The investment objective for the plans are to earn, over moving
    twenty-year periods, the long-term expected rate of return, net
    of investment fees and transaction costs, to satisfy the benefit
    obligations of the plan, while at the same time maintaining
    sufficient liquidity to pay benefit obligations and proper
    expenses, and meet any other cash needs, in the short- to
    medium-term.

The weighted average target asset allocations for the
    Company’s pension plans are as follows (in percentages):

The equity and debt securities objectives are to provide
    diversified exposure across the US and Global equity markets and
    to manage the plan’s risks and returns through the use of
    multiple managers and strategies. The fixed income strategy is
    designed to reduce liability-related interest rate risk by
    investing in bonds that match the duration and credit quality of
    the plan liabilities. Derivatives based strategies may be used
    to improve the effectiveness of the hedges. Other types of
    investments include investments in real estate and insurance
    contracts.

The Company adopted certain provisions of FASB ASC Topic

715-20-50,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits: Defined Benefit
    Plans – General: Disclosure

(“FASB ASC Topic

715-20-50”),

on January 1, 2009. FASB ASC Topic

715-20-50

requires enhanced disclosures about the plan assets of a
    company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans intended to provide financial statement users with a
    greater understanding of the inputs and valuation techniques
    used to measure the fair value of plan assets and the effect of
    fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on
    changes in plan assets for the period using the framework
    established



under FASB ASC Topic 820. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair
    value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
    value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority
    to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). This
    hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a
    financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels
    of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon
    the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
    calculation. Valuations for fund investments such as
    common/collective trusts and registered investment companies,
    which do not have readily determinable fair values, are
    typically estimated using a net asset value provided by a third
    party as a practical expedient.

The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as
    follows:

Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company

Level 2 — inputs that are observable in the
    marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1

Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable in the
    marketplace and significant to the valuation

The Company’s defined benefit plan assets are measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis and include the following items:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Foreign and domestic
    currencies as well as short term securities are valued at cost
    plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.

Common/Collective Trusts:

Composed of various funds
    whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic
    equities, fixed income securities, and short term investments.
    Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by
    the plan at year-end.

Corporate stock and government and corporate
    debt:

Valued at the closing price reported on the
    active market in which the individual securities are traded.
    Automated quotes are provided by multiple pricing services and
    validated by the plan custodian. These securities are traded on
    exchanges as well as in the over the counter market.

Registered Investment Companies:

Composed of various
    mutual funds and other investment companies whose diversified
    portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic equities, fixed
    income securities, and short term investments. Investments are
    valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at
    year-end.

Mortgage Backed Securities:

Fair value is estimated
    based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing services
    for identical or comparable assets. Mortgage Backed Securities
    are traded in the over the counter broker/dealer market.

Derivatives:

Derivative financial instruments are
    valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques.
    These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2
    inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange
    rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash
    flow calculation considering the instrument’s term,
    notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant
    inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps,
    foreign currency forwards and swaps, and options are observable
    in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the
    hierarchy.

Insurance contracts:

Valued at contributions made,
    plus earnings, less participant withdrawals and administrative
    expenses, which approximates fair value.

The financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are
    established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each
    plan’s liability structure. The Company’s asset
    allocation policy is based on detailed asset/liability analyses.
    In developing investment policy and financial goals,
    consideration is given to each plan’s demographics, the
    returns and risks associated with current and alternative
    investment strategies and the current and projected cash,
    expense and funding ratios of each plan. Investment policies
    must also comply with local statutory requirements as determined
    by each country. A formal asset/liability study of each plan is
    undertaken every 3 to 5 years or whenever there has been a
    material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or
    funding status and investment market.



The Company has adopted a long-term investment horizon such that
    the risk and duration of investment losses are weighed against
    the long-term potential for appreciation of assets. Although
    there cannot be complete assurance that these objectives will be
    realized, it is believed that the likelihood for their
    realization is reasonably high, based upon the asset allocation
    chosen and the historical and expected performance of the asset
    classes utilized by the plans. The intent is for investments to
    be broadly diversified across asset classes, investment styles,
    market sectors, investment managers, developed and emerging
    markets and securities in order to moderate portfolio volatility
    and risk. Investments may be in separate accounts, commingled
    trusts, mutual funds and other pooled asset portfolios provided
    they all conform to fiduciary standards.

External investment managers are hired to manage pension assets.
    Investment consultants assist with the screening process for
    each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the investment
    portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a composite of
    market indices that are weighted to match each plan’s
    target asset allocation. The portfolio return should also (over
    the long-term) meet or exceed the return used for actuarial
    calculations in order to meet the future needs of each plan.

Employer contributions for pension benefits and postretirement
    benefits are estimated to be $178 million and
    $27 million, respectively, in 2011. The table below
    reflects pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or
    from the Company’s assets. The postretirement benefits
    represent the Company’s share of the benefit cost.

    Environmental

General

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations
    worldwide which impose limitations on the discharge of
    pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for
    the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes. The Company believes that it is in substantial
    compliance with all applicable environmental laws and
    regulations. The Company is also subject to retained
    environmental obligations specified in various contractual
    agreements arising from the divestiture of certain businesses by
    the Company or one of its predecessor companies.



Expenditures, including expenditures for legal compliance,
    internal environmental initiatives, remediation of active,
    divested, demerger and US Superfund sites (as defined below) and

Remediation

Due to its industrial history and through retained contractual
    and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to
    remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on
    divested, demerger or US Superfund sites (as defined below). In
    addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the Company
    and Hoechst AG (“Hoechst”), a specified portion of the
    responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of
    Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Company
    (Note 23). The Company provides for such obligations when
    the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

Remediation efforts recorded in the consolidated statements of
    operations are as follows:

The Company believes that environmental remediation costs will
    not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of
    the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the
    results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting
    period.

The Company did not record any insurance recoveries related to
    these matters for the reported periods and there are no
    receivables for insurance recoveries as of December 31,
    2010. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were



receivables of $7 million and $9 million,
    respectively, from the former owner of the Company’s
    cellulose Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom acetate flake, tow and
    film business, which was acquired in 2007, and is included in
    the Company’s Consumer Specialties segment.

German
    InfraServs

On January 1, 1997, coinciding with a reorganization of the
    Hoechst businesses in Germany, real estate service companies
    (“InfraServs”) were created to own directly the land
    and property and to provide various technical and administrative
    services at each of the manufacturing locations. The Company
    holds an interest in manufacturing operations at the InfraServ
    location in Frankfurt am Main-Hoechst, Germany and holds
    interests in the companies which own and operate the former
    Hoechst sites in Gendorf, Knapsack and Wiesbaden.

InfraServs are liable for any residual contamination and other
    pollution because they own the real estate on which the
    individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, as the responsible party under German public
    law, is liable to third parties for all environmental damage
    that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and
    real estate. The contribution agreements entered into in 1997
    between Hoechst and the respective operating companies, as part
    of the divestiture of these companies, provide that the
    operating companies will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, against environmental liabilities resulting from the
    transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServs have agreed
    to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against any
    environmental liability arising out of or in connection with
    environmental pollution of any site. Likewise, in certain
    circumstances the Company could be responsible for the
    elimination of residual contamination on a few sites that were
    not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst,
    and its legal successors, must reimburse the Company for
    two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between
    the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination
    caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which
    cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no
    third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the
    InfraServ partnership. In view of this potential obligation to
    eliminate residual contamination, the InfraServs, primarily
    relating to equity and cost investments which are not
    consolidated by the Company, have reserves of $94 million
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective
    indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination,
    the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ
    companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a
    number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are
    not satisfied by either the InfraServs or their owners, these
    liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with
    the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst, and its legal
    successors, will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any
    such costs. Likewise, in certain circumstances the Company could
    be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on
    several sites that were not transferred to InfraServ companies,
    in which case Hoechst, and its legal successors, must also
    reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.
    The German InfraServs are owned partially by the Company, as
    noted below, and the remaining ownership is held by various
    other companies. The Company’s ownership interest and
    environmental liability participation percentages for such
    liabilities which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner
    were as follows as of December 31, 2010:

US
    Superfund Sites

In the US, the Company may be subject to substantial claims
    brought by US federal or state regulatory agencies or private
    individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In
    particular, the Company has a potential liability under the US
    Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws
    (collectively referred to as “Superfund”) for
    investigation and cleanup costs at approximately 36 sites. At
    most of these sites, numerous companies, including the Company,
    or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the
    Environmental Protection Agency, state governing bodies or
    private individuals consider such companies to be potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) under Superfund or related
    laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various
    stages. The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites
    and the status of the insurance coverage for most of these
    proceedings is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot
    accurately determine its ultimate liability for investigation or
    cleanup costs at these sites.

As events progress at each site for which it has been named a
    PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site
    cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these
    liabilities, the Company considers its shipment of waste to a
    site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the
    types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the
    magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the
    number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company will join
    with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that will
    settle, among PRPs, each party’s percentage allocation of
    costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ
    from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities
    and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most
    current information available.

US Superfund site reserves were utilized as follows:

    Shareholders’ Equity

Preferred
    Stock

On February 1, 2010, the Company delivered notice to the
    holders of its 4.25% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
    (the “Preferred Stock”) that it was calling for the
    redemption of all 9.6 million outstanding shares of
    Preferred Stock. Holders of the Preferred Stock were entitled to
    convert each share of Preferred Stock into 1.2600 shares of
    the Company’s Series A common stock, par value $0.0001
    per share, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City
    time, on February 19, 2010. As of such date, holders of
    Preferred Stock had elected to convert 9,591,276 shares of
    Preferred Stock into an aggregate of 12,084,942 shares of
    Series A common stock. The 8,724 shares of Preferred
    Stock that remained outstanding after such conversions were
    redeemed by the Company on February 22, 2010 for
    7,437 shares of Series A common stock, in accordance
    with the terms of the Preferred Stock. In addition to the shares
    of Series A common stock issued in respect of the shares of
    Preferred Stock converted and redeemed, the Company paid cash in
    lieu of fractional shares. The Company recorded expense of less
    than $1 million to Additional paid-in capital in the
    consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31,
    2010 related to the conversion and redemption of the Preferred
    Stock.

Common
    Stock

The Company’s Board of Directors follows a policy of
    declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash
    dividend on each share of the Company’s Series A
    common stock unless the Company’s Board of Directors, in
    its



sole discretion, determines otherwise. Further, such dividends
    payable to holders of the Company’s Series A common
    stock cannot be declared or paid nor can any funds be set aside
    for the payment thereof, unless the Company has paid or set
    aside funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid
    dividends with respect to the shares of the Company’s
    Preferred Stock. As discussed above, all Preferred Stock was
    redeemed by the Company in February 2010 and no preferred stock
    or accumulated dividends remained outstanding as of December,
    31, 2010. The amount available to pay cash dividends is
    restricted by the Company’s senior credit agreement and the
    Notes.

In April 2010, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
    approved a 25% increase in the Company’s quarterly
    Series A common stock cash dividend. The Board of Directors
    increased the quarterly dividend rate from $0.04 to $0.05 per
    share of Series A common stock on a quarterly basis. The
    new dividend rate was applicable to dividends payable beginning
    in August 2010.

The Company declared and paid cash dividends to holders of its
    Series A common stock as follows:

    authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of the
    Company’s Series A common stock. This authorization
    was increased to $500 million in October 2008. The
    authorization gives management discretion in determining the
    conditions under which shares may be repurchased. The number of
    shares repurchased and the average purchase price paid per share

In March 2010, the Company concluded that certain long-lived
    assets were partially impaired at its acetate flake and tow
    manufacturing operations in Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom
    (Note 4). Accordingly, the Company wrote down the related
    property, plant and equipment to its fair value of
    $31 million, resulting in long-lived asset impairment
    losses of $72 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2010. The Company calculated the fair value
    for the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model
    incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks
    involved which is classified as a Level 3 measurement under
    FASB ASC Topic 820. The key assumptions used in the discounted
    cash flow valuation model included discount rates, growth rates,
    cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates,
    growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive
    and susceptible to change as they require significant management
    judgment.



As a result of the announced closure of the Company’s
    acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations in Spondon,
    Derby, United Kingdom (Note 4), the Company recorded
    $15 million of employee termination benefits during the
    year ended December 31, 2010. The Spondon, Derby, United
    Kingdom facility is included in the Consumer Specialties segment.

As a result of the Company’s Pardies, France “Project
    of Closure” (Note 4), the Company recorded exit costs
    of $12 million during the year ended December 31,
    2010, which consisted of $6 million in employee termination
    benefits, $1 million of long-lived asset impairment losses,
    $2 million of contract termination costs and other plant
    closure costs and $3 million of reindustrialization costs.
    The Pardies, France facility is included in the Acetyl
    Intermediates segment.

As a result of several business optimization projects undertaken
    by the Company beginning in 2009 and continuing throughout 2010,
    the Company recorded $11 million in employee termination
    costs during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2010 also
    included gains of $13 million, net, related to settlements
    in resolution of a commercial disputes. The settlements were
    recorded in the Company’s Consumer Specialties segment.


During the first quarter of 2009, the Company began efforts to
    align production capacity and staffing levels with the
    Company’s view of an economic environment of prolonged
    lower demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Other
    charges included employee termination benefits of
    $40 million related to this endeavor. As a result of the
    shutdown of the vinyl acetate monomer (“VAM”)
    production unit in Cangrejera, Mexico, the Company recognized
    employee termination benefits of $1 million and long-lived
    asset impairment losses of $1 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The VAM production unit in Cangrejera,
    Mexico is included in the Company’s Acetyl Intermediates
    segment.

As a result of the “Project of Closure” (Note 4),
    Other charges for the Company included exit costs of
    $89 million during the year ended December 31, 2009,
    which consisted of $60 million in employee termination
    benefits, $17 million of contract termination costs and
    $12 million of long-lived asset impairment losses related
    to capitalized costs associated with asset retirement
    obligations (Note 12). The Pardies, France facility is
    included in the Acetyl Intermediates segment.

Due to continued declines in demand in automotive and electronic
    sectors during 2009, the Company announced plans to reduce
    capacity by ceasing polyester polymer production at its Ticona
    manufacturing plant in Shelby, North Carolina. Other charges for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 included employee
    termination benefits of $2 million and long-lived asset
    impairment losses of $1 million related to this event. The
    Shelby, North Carolina facility is included in the Advanced
    Engineered Materials segment.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    partially offset by $6 million of insurance recoveries in
    satisfaction of claims the Company made related to the unplanned
    outage of the Company’s Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid
    facility during 2007, a $9 million decrease in legal
    reserves for plumbing claims due to the Company’s ongoing
    assessment of the likely outcome of the plumbing actions and the
    expiration of the statute of limitation.


Other (charges) gains, net for asset impairments includes
    long-lived asset impairment losses of $92 million related
    to the potential closure of the Company’s acetic acid and
    VAM production facility in Pardies, France, the VAM production
    unit in Cangrejera, Mexico (which the Company subsequently
    decided to shut down effective at the end of February
    2009) and certain other facilities. Of the $92 million
    recorded in December 2008, $76 million relates to the
    Acetyl Intermediates segment and $16 million relates to the
    Advanced Engineered Materials segment. Consideration of this
    potential capacity reduction was necessitated by the significant
    change in the global economic environment and anticipated lower
    customer demand.



Additionally, the Company recognized $23 million of
    long-lived asset impairment losses related to the shutdown of
    the Company’s Pampa, Texas facility (Acetyl Intermediates
    segment).

Other (charges) gains, net for employee termination benefits
    includes severance and retention charges of $13 million
    related to the sale of the Company’s Pampa, Texas facility
    and $8 million of severance and retention charges related
    to other business optimization plans undertaken by the Company.

Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)



(1)

Includes deferred tax asset valuation allowances primarily for
    the Company’s deferred tax assets in the US, Luxembourg,
    France, Spain, China, the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as
    other foreign jurisdictions. These valuation allowances relate
    primarily to net operating loss carryforward benefits and other
    net deferred tax assets, all of which may not be realizable.

The Company maintained a valuation allowance against its US net
    deferred tax assets since 2004. During 2009, the Company
    concluded that, due to cumulative profitability, it is more
    likely than not that it will realize its net US deferred tax
    assets with the exception of certain state net operating loss
    carryforwards. Accordingly, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a deferred tax
    benefit of $492 million for the release of the

beginning-of-the-year

US valuation allowance associated with those US net deferred tax
    assets expected to be realized in 2009 and subsequent years.



For the year ended December 31, 2010, the valuation
    allowance increased by $51 million consisting of:
    (a) income tax expense, net, of $39 million,
    (b) a decrease of $13 million related to foreign
    currency translation adjustments and (c) $25 million
    of other increases related to unrecognized tax benefits and
    other adjustments to deferred taxes. The change in valuation
    allowance associated with foreign currency translation
    adjustments is related to changes in deferred tax assets for
    unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on effective hedges
    and on foreign income previously taxed but not yet received in
    the US. The benefit also relates to foreign currency translation
    adjustments for deferred tax assets recorded in various foreign
    jurisdictions. The increase related to unrecognized tax benefits
    and other adjustments to deferred taxes includes adjustments to
    temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards due
    to changes in uncertain tax positions.

A reconciliation of the significant differences between the US
    federal statutory tax rate of 35% and the effective income tax
    rate on income from continuing operations is as follows:

Includes impact of earnings from China and Singapore subject to
    tax holidays which expire between 2008 and 2013 and favorable
    tax rates in other jurisdictions.

Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on
    accumulated but undistributed earnings of $2.9 billion as
    of December 31, 2010 as such earnings have been permanently
    reinvested in the business. The determination of the amount of
    the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the
    undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2010 was 21% compared to (97)% for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate for
    2009 was favorably impacted by the release of the US valuation
    allowance on net deferred tax assets, partially offset by
    increases in valuation allowances on certain foreign net
    deferred tax assets and the effect of new tax legislation in
    Mexico. The effective rate for the year ended December 31,
    2010 was favorably impacted by amendments to tax legislation in
    Mexico.

The Company operates under tax holidays in various countries
    which are effective through December 2013. In China, one of the
    Company’s entities has a tax holiday that provided for a
    zero percent tax rate in 2008. For 2009 through 2011, the
    Company’s tax rate is 50% of the statutory rate, or 12.5%
    based on the 2010 statutory rate of 25%. In Singapore, one of
    the Company’s entities has a tax holiday that provides for
    a zero percent tax rate through 2011. The Company realized no
    material benefits from tax holidays for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Mexico enacted the 2008 Fiscal Reform Bill on October 1,
    2007. Effective January 1, 2008, the bill repealed the
    existing asset-based tax and established a dual income tax
    system consisting of a new minimum flat tax (the
    “IETU”) and the existing regular income tax system.
    The IETU system taxes companies on cash basis net income,
    consisting only of certain specified items of revenue and
    expense, at a rate of 16.5%, 17% and 17.5% for 2008, 2009 and
    2010 forward, respectively. In general, companies must pay the
    higher of the income tax or the IETU, although the IETU is not
    creditable against future income tax liabilities. The Company
    has determined that it will primarily



be subject to the IETU in future periods. Accordingly, the
    Company has recorded tax expense (benefit) of $19 million,
    $(5) million and $7 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for the tax
    effects of the IETU system.

In December 2009, Mexico enacted the 2010 Mexican Tax Reform
    Bill (“Tax Reform Bill”) to be effective
    January 1, 2010. Under this legislation, the corporate
    income tax rate was temporarily increased from 28% to 30% for
    2010 through 2012, reduced to 29% in 2013 and reduced to 28% in
    2014 and future years. These rate changes would impact the
    Company in the event that it reverts to paying taxes on a
    regular income tax basis versus on the IETU basis. Further,
    under current law, income tax loss carryforwards reported in the
    tax consolidation that were not utilized on an individual
    company basis within 10 years were subject to recapture.
    The Tax Reform Bill as enacted accelerated this recapture period
    from 10 years to 5 years and effectively required
    payment of taxes even if no benefit was obtained through the tax
    consolidation regime. Finally, significant modifications were
    made to the rules for income taxes previously deferred on
    intercompany dividends, as well as to income taxes related to
    differences between consolidated and individual Mexican tax
    earnings and profits. The estimated income tax impact to the
    Company of the Tax Reform Bill at December 31, 2009 was
    $73 million and was recorded to Income tax (provision)
    benefit in the consolidated statements of operations.

In March 2010, the Mexican tax authorities issued Miscellaneous
    Tax Resolutions (“MTRs”) to clarify various provisions
    included in the Tax Reform Bill related to recapture amounts for
    2004 and prior years, including certain aspects of the recapture
    rules related to income tax loss carryforwards, intercompany
    dividends and differences between consolidated and individual
    Mexican tax earnings and profits. At March 31, 2010, the
    application of the MTRs resulted in a reduction of
    $43 million to the estimated income tax impact of the Tax
    Reform Bill that was initially recorded by the Company during
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

In December 2010, the Mexican tax authorities issued an
    additional MTR addressing tax year 2005 and subsequent periods.
    The MTRs issued in March 2010 and December 2010 eliminated the
    recapture tax on losses for which no tax benefit was received in
    consolidation and also clarified certain other aspects of the
    Tax Reform Bill originally enacted in December 2009. The
    December 2010 MTR resulted in an additional reduction of
    $27 million to the estimated tax liability previously
    recorded by the Company. After inflation and exchange rate
    changes, the Company’s estimated tax liability at
    December 31, 2010 related to the combined Tax Reform Bill
    and 2010 MTRs is $6 million, payable from 2011 to 2018.

In March 2010, the President of the United States signed into
    law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the
    Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Currently,
    employers providing retiree prescription drug coverage that is
    at least as valuable as the coverage offered under Medicare
    Part D are entitled to a subsidy from the government. Prior
    to the new law, employers were entitled to deduct the entire
    cost of providing the retiree prescription drug coverage, even
    though a portion was offset by the subsidy. Under the new
    legislation, in years subsequent to 2012, the tax deductible
    prescription coverage is reduced by the amount of the subsidy.
    As a result, the Company reduced its deferred tax asset related
    to postretirement prescription drug coverage by the amount of
    the subsidy to be received subsequent to 2012. This reduction of
    $7 million to the Company’s deferred tax asset was
    recorded to Income tax (provision) benefit in the consolidated
    statements of operations during the three months ended
    March 31, 2010.

On December 17, 2010, the President of the United States
    signed a multi-billion dollar tax package, the Tax Relief,
    Unemployment Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (2010
    Tax Relief Act or act). The 2010 Tax Relief Act extends the
    Bush-era individual and capital gains/dividend tax cuts for all
    individual taxpayers for two years and includes a one year
    payroll tax cut for individuals. The act also increases
    50 percent bonus depreciation to 100 percent for
    qualified investments made after September 8, 2010 and
    before January 1, 2012, and the act also makes
    50 percent bonus depreciation available for qualified
    property placed in service after December 31, 2011 and
    before January 1, 2013. The 2010 Tax Relief Act also
    provided a two year extension of expired provisions that were
    relevant to the Company including the research tax credit and
    look through treatment for controlled foreign corporations. The
    impact to the company of the new legislation was not material
    for the year ended December 31, 2010, but the items noted
    will provide additional tax benefits to the company in 2011 and
    2012.



As of December 31, 2010, the Company had US federal net
    operating loss carryforwards of $39 million that are
    subject to limitation. These net operating loss carryforwards
    begin to expire in 2021. At December 31, 2010, the Company
    also had state net operating loss carryforwards, net of federal
    tax impact, of $52 million, $48 million of which are
    offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertain recoverability.
    A portion of these loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
    2011.

The Company also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards as
    of December 31, 2010 of $1.0 billion for Luxembourg,
    France, Spain, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Germany and
    other foreign jurisdictions with various expiration dates. Net
    operating losses in China have various carryforward periods and
    begin expiring in 2011. Net operating losses in most other
    foreign jurisdictions have no expiration date. Net operating
    losses in Mexico have a ten year carryforward period and began
    to expire in 2009. However, these losses are not available for
    use under the new IETU tax regulations in Mexico. As the IETU is
    the primary system upon which the Company will be subject to tax
    in future periods, no deferred tax asset has been reflected in
    the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 for
    these income tax loss carryforwards.

    unrecognized tax benefits are included in current Other
    liabilities (Note 11) in the consolidated balance
    sheets.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax (provision) benefit in
    the consolidated statements of operations as follows:

The Company operates in the US (including multiple state
    jurisdictions), Germany and approximately 40 other foreign
    jurisdictions including Canada, China, France, Mexico and
    Singapore. Examinations are ongoing in a number of those
    jurisdictions including, most significantly, in Germany for the
    years 2001 to 2004 and 2005 to 2007, and in the US for the years
    2006 to 2008, which were selected for audit in 2010. The
    Company’s US federal income tax returns for 2003 and beyond
    are open for examination under statute. The Company’s
    German corporate



tax returns for 2001 and beyond are open for examination under
    statute. Currently, unrecognized tax benefits are not expected
    to change significantly over the next 12 months.

Stock-Based
    and Other Management Compensation Plans

In April 2009, the Company approved a global incentive plan
    which replaces the Company’s 2004 stock incentive plan. The
    2009 Global Incentive Plan (“GIP”) enables the
    compensation committee of the Board of Directors to award
    incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, shares of Series A common stock, restricted stock,
    restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and incentive bonuses
    (which may be paid in cash or stock or a combination thereof),
    any of which may be performance-based, with vesting and other
    award provisions that provide effective incentive to Company
    employees (including officers), non-management directors and
    other service providers. Under the 2009 GIP, the Company no
    longer can grant RSUs with the right to participate in dividends
    or dividend equivalents.

The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2009
    GIP is equal to 5,350,000 shares plus (a) any shares
    of Series A common stock that remain available for issuance
    under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (“SIP”) (not
    including any shares of Series A common stock that are
    subject to outstanding awards under the 2004 SIP or any shares
    of Series A common stock that were issued pursuant to
    awards under the 2004 SIP) and (b) any awards under the
    2004 stock incentive plan that remain outstanding that cease for
    any reason to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of
    exercise or settlement of the award to the extent that such
    award is exercised for or settled in vested and non-forfeitable
    shares). As of December 31, 2010, total shares available
    for awards and total shares subject to outstanding awards are as
    follows:

Upon the termination of a participant’s employment with the
    Company by reason of death or disability or by the Company
    without cause (as defined in the respective award agreements),
    an award in amount equal to (i) the value of the award
    granted multiplied by (ii) a fraction, (x) the
    numerator of which is the number of full months between grant
    date and the date of such termination, and (y) the
    denominator of which is the term of the award, such product to
    be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and reduced by
    (iii) the value of any award that previously vested, shall
    immediately vest and become payable to the Participant. Upon the
    termination of a Participant’s employment with the Company
    for any other reason, any unvested portion of the award shall be
    forfeited and cancelled without consideration.

There was $19 million and $0 million of tax benefit
    realized from stock option exercises and vesting of RSUs during
    the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    During the year ended December 31, 2008 the Company
    reversed $8 million of the $19 million tax benefit
    that was realized during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Deferred
    Compensation

In April 2007, certain participants in the Company’s 2004
    deferred compensation plan elected to participate in a revised
    program, which includes both cash awards and restricted stock
    units (see Restricted Stock Units below). Based on participation
    in the revised program, the Company expensed $9 million,
    $10 million and $8 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to
    the revised program and made payments of $4 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2010 to participants who left
    the Company and $28 million to active employees during
    December 2010. As of December 31, 2010, $1 million
    remains to be paid during 2011 under the revised program.

As of December 31, 2009, there was no deferred compensation
    payable remaining associated with the 2004 deferred compensation
    plan. The Company recorded expense related to participants
    continuing in the 2004 deferred



compensation plan of $0 million, $1 million and
    $3 million during the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

In December 2007, the Company adopted a deferred compensation
    plan whereby certain of the Company’s senior employees and
    directors were offered the opportunity to defer a portion of
    their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal
    to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts based upon the
    market performance of specified measurement funds selected by
    the participant. Participants are required to make deferral
    elections under the plan prior to January 1 of the year such
    deferrals will be withheld from their compensation. The Company
    expensed less than $1 million during each of the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to this plan.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan

In December 2008, the Company granted time-vesting cash awards
    of $22 million to the Company’s executive officers and
    certain other key employees. Each award of cash vests 30% on
    October 14, 2009, 30% on October 14, 2010 and 40% on
    October 14, 2011. In its sole discretion, the compensation
    committee of the Board of Directors may at any time convert all
    or a portion of the cash award to an award of time-vesting
    restricted stock units. The liability cash awards are being
    accrued and expensed over the term of the agreements outlined
    above.

Activity recorded in the consolidated financial statements
    related to the time-vesting cash awards is as follows:

Stock
    Options

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan that makes
    awards of stock options to the Company’s executives and
    certain employees. It is the Company’s policy to grant
    options with an exercise price equal to the average of the high
    and low price of the Company’s Series A common stock
    on the grant date. The options issued have a term ranging from
    seven to ten years and vest on a graded basis over four years.
    The estimated value of the Company’s stock-based awards
    less expected forfeitures is recognized over the awards’
    respective vesting period on a straight-line basis.

Generally, vested stock options are exercised through a
    broker-assisted cashless exercise program. A broker-assisted
    cashless exercise is the simultaneous exercise of a stock option
    by an employee and a sale of the shares through a broker.
    Authorized shares of the Company’s Series A common
    stock are used to settle stock options.

In October 2010, the Company granted awards of stock options to
    certain executive officers of the Company that require a holding
    period of one year subsequent to exercising a stock option award
    for net profit shares (as defined below) acquired upon exercise.
    Net profit shares means the aggregate number of Shares
    determined by the Company’s human resources department
    representing the total number of shares remaining after taking
    into account the following costs related to exercise:
    (i) the aggregate option price with respect to the
    exercise; (ii) the amount of all applicable taxes with
    respect to the exercise, assuming the participant’s maximum
    applicable federal, state and local tax rates (and applicable
    employment taxes); and (iii) any transaction costs.



The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the grant
    date using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The weighted
    average assumptions used in the model are outlined in the
    following table:

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on the
    Company’s historical volatilities. When establishing the
    expected life assumptions, the Company reviews annual historical
    employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting
    periods.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $5 million of total unrecognized compensation expense
    related to stock options, excluding actual forfeitures, which is
    expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of
    2.4 years.

During 2009, the Company extended the contractual life of
    4 million fully vested share options held by
    6 employees. As a result of that modification, the Company
    recognized additional compensation expense of $1 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009.



Restricted
    Stock Units

The Company’s RSUs are net settled by withholding shares of
    the Company’s Series A common stock to cover minimum
    statutory income taxes and remitting the remaining shares of the
    Company’s Series A common stock to an individual
    brokerage account. Authorized shares of the Company’s
    Series A common stock are used to settle RSUs.

Performance-based RSUs.

The Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to the Company’s executive officers
    and certain employees once per year. The Company may also grant
    performance-based RSUs to certain new employees or to employees
    who assume positions of increasing responsibility at the time
    those events occur. The number of performance-based RSUs that
    ultimately vest is dependent on one or both of the following
    according to the terms of the specific award agreement: The
    achievement of a) internal profitability targets
    (performance condition) and b) market performance targets
    measured by the comparison of the Company’s stock
    performance versus a defined peer group (market condition).

The performance-based RSUs generally cliff-vest during the
    Company’s quarter-end September 30 black-out period three
    years from the date of grant. The ultimate number of shares of
    the Company’s Series A common stock issued will range
    from zero to stretch, with stretch defined individually under
    each award, net of shares used to cover personal income taxes
    withheld. The market condition is factored into the estimated
    fair value per unit and compensation expense for each award will
    be based on the probability of achieving internal profitability
    targets, as applicable, and recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the respective grant, less estimated
    forfeitures. For performance-based RSUs granted without a
    performance condition, compensation expense is based on the fair
    value per unit recognized on a straight-line basis over the term
    of the grant, less estimated forfeitures. Upon the termination
    of participant’s employment by the Company without cause
    prior to the vesting date, the participant is eligible for a
    prorated number of performance-based RSUs based on a formula as
    outlined in each agreement.

(In $ millions)

Total




Fair value for the Company’s performance-based RSUs was
    estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation
    approach less the present value of the expected dividends not
    received during the performance period. Monte Carlo simulation
    was utilized to randomly generate future stock returns for the
    Company and each company in the defined peer group for each
    grant based on company-specific dividend yields, volatilities
    and stock return correlations. These returns were used to
    calculate future performance-based RSU vesting percentages and
    the



simulated values of the vested performance-based RSUs were then
    discounted to present value using a risk-free rate, yielding the
    expected value of these performance-based RSUs.

The range of assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation
    approach is outlined in the following table:

Time-based RSUs.

The Company grants non-employee
    Directors time-based RSUs annually that generally vest one year
    after grant. The fair value of the time-based RSUs is equal to
    the closing price of the Company’s Series A common
    stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected
    dividends not received during the vesting period.

The Company also grants time-based RSUs to the Company’s
    executives and certain employees that vest ratably over time
    intervals ranging from three to four years. The fair value of
    the time-based RSUs is equal to the average of the high and low
    price of the Company’s Series A common stock on the
    grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not
    received during the vesting period. Upon the termination of
    participant’s employment by the Company without cause prior
    to the vesting date, the participant is eligible for a prorated
    number of time-based RSUs based on a formula as outlined in each
    agreement.

The fair value of shares vested for time-based RSUs is as

(In $ millions)

Total




In October and December 2010, the Company granted time-based
    RSUs and performance-based RSUs, respectively, to executive
    officers and certain employees of the Company. The grant
    requires a holding period of seven years from the grant date of
    the awards for 0 % to 45 % of the shares vested,
    depending on salary level, as specified in each individual
    agreement. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) has a requirement to hold 75 % of the
    shares vested for seven years from the grant date. The fair
    value of the RSUs with holding periods were discounted an
    additional 30 % due to the lack of transferability of these
    RSUs during the holding period. The discount was determined
    using the weighted-average results as calculated under the
    Chaffe and Finnerty models.



Performance
    Units

In December 2008, the Company granted 200,000 performance units
    to be settled in cash to the Company’s CEO. The terms of
    the performance units are substantially similar to the
    performance-based RSUs granted in December 2008 and include a
    performance condition and a market condition. The value of the
    performance units is equivalent to the value of one share of the
    Company’s Series A common stock and any amounts that
    may vest under the performance unit award agreement are to be
    settled in cash rather than shares of the Company’s
    Series A common stock. The compensation committee of the
    Board of Directors may elect to convert all or any portion of
    the performance units award to an award of an equivalent value
    of performance-based RSUs. The performance units vest on
    October 14, 2011.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

To reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the Company’s
    variable rate debt, the Company utilizes interest rate swap
    agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate debt to a
    fixed rate obligation. These interest rate swap agreements are
    designated as cash flow hedges. If an interest rate swap
    agreement is terminated prior to its maturity, the amount
    previously recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net is recognized into earnings over the period that the
    hedged transaction impacts earnings. If the hedging relationship
    is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted
    transaction will not occur according to the original strategy,
    any related amounts previously recorded to Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net are recognized into earnings
    immediately.



In March 2007, in anticipation of the April 2007 debt
    refinancing, the Company entered into various US dollar and Euro
    interest rate swap agreements, which became effective on
    April 2, 2007, with notional amounts of $1.6 billion
    and €150 million, respectively. The notional amount of
    the $1.6 billion US dollar interest rate swaps decreased by
    $400 million effective January 2, 2008 and decreased
    by another $200 million effective January 2, 2009. To
    offset the declines, the Company entered into US dollar interest
    rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million
    which became effective on January 2, 2008 and an additional
    US dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of
    $200 million which became effective April 2, 2009. The
    notional amount of the interest rate swaps decreased by
    $100 million effective January 4, 2010. No new swaps
    were entered into to offset the declines.

In August 2010, the Company executed a forward-starting interest
    rate swap with a notional amount of $1.1 billion. As a
    result of the swap, the Company has fixed the LIBOR portion of
    $1.1 billion of the Company’s floating rate debt at
    1.7125 % effective January 2, 2012 through
    January 2, 2014.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk Management

Certain subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in
    currencies other than their respective functional currencies,
    which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into
    foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize its exposure to
    foreign currency fluctuations. Through these instruments, the
    Company mitigates its foreign currency exposure on transactions
    with third party entities as well as intercompany transactions.
    The foreign currency forwards and swaps are not designated as
    hedges under FASB ASC Topic 815. Gains and losses on foreign
    currency forwards and swaps entered into to offset foreign
    exchange impacts on intercompany balances are classified as
    Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of
    operations. Gains and losses on foreign currency forwards and
    swaps entered into to offset foreign exchange impacts on all
    other assets and liabilities are classified as Foreign exchange
    gain (loss), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.

The following table indicates the total US dollar equivalents of
    net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign

To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
    a foreign operation, the Company entered into cross currency
    swaps with certain financial institutions in 2004. The cross
    currency swaps and the Euro-denominated portion of the senior
    term loan were designated as a hedge of a net investment of a
    foreign operation. The Company dedesignated the net investment
    hedge due to the debt refinancing in April 2007 and redesignated
    the cross currency swaps and new senior Euro term loan in July
    2007.

Under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, the
    Company paid approximately €13 million in interest and
    received approximately $16 million in interest on June 15
    and December 15 of each year. Upon maturity of the



cross currency swap agreements in June 2008, the Company owed
    €276 million ($426 million) and was owed
    $333 million. In settlement of the obligation, the Company
    paid $93 million (net of interest of $3 million) in
    June 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    dedesignated €385 million of the €400
    Euro-denominated portion of the term loan, previously designated
    as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation. The
    remaining €15 million Euro-denominated portion of the
    term loan was dedesignated as a hedge of a net investment of a
    foreign operation in June 2009. Prior to the dedesignations, the
    Company had been using external derivative contracts to offset
    foreign currency exposures on certain intercompany loans. As a
    result of the dedesignations, the foreign currency exposure
    created by the Euro-denominated term loan is expected to offset
    the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans,
    decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and
    reducing the Company’s exposure to external counterparties.

Commodity
    Risk Management

The Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its
    procurement of certain raw materials. The Company manages its
    exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of
    long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales
    agreements and forward purchase contracts. The Company regularly
    assesses its practice of using forward purchase contracts and
    other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with
    changes in market conditions. Forward purchases and swap
    contracts for raw materials are principally settled through
    physical delivery of the commodity. For qualifying contracts,
    the Company has elected to apply the normal purchases and normal
    sales exception of FASB ASC Topic 815 based on the probability
    at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that
    the Company would not settle net and the transaction would
    result in the physical delivery of the commodity. As such,
    realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
    cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

In addition, the Company occasionally enters into financial
    derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy
    source. Typically, these types of transactions do not qualify
    for hedge accounting. These instruments are marked to market at
    each reporting period and gains (losses) are included in Cost of
    sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company
    recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during
    the years



ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company did not have any open
    financial derivative contracts for commodities.

22.

Fair
    Value Measurements

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted certain
    provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 on January 1, 2008 and
    2009. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tiered fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used
    in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are
    defined as follows:

Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company

Level 2 — inputs that are observable in the
    marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1

Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable in the
    marketplace and significant to the valuation

FASB ASC Topic 820 requires the Company to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
    If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different
    levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized
    based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    fair value calculation.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured
    at fair value on a recurring basis and include marketable
    securities and derivative financial instruments. Marketable
    securities include US government and corporate bonds and equity
    securities. Derivative financial instruments include interest
    rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps.

Marketable Securities.

Where possible, the Company
    utilizes quoted prices in active markets to measure debt and
    equity securities; such items are classified as Level 1 in
    the hierarchy and include equity securities and US government
    bonds. When quoted market prices for identical assets are
    unavailable, varying valuation techniques are



used. Common inputs in valuing these assets include, among
    others, benchmark yields and issuer spreads. Such assets are
    classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy and typically
    include corporate bonds and other US government securities.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

Derivative
    financial instruments are valued in the market using discounted
    cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1
    and Level 2 inputs such as interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the

In general, the cost investments included in the table above are

    approximate or are less than the fair values.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair values of cash
    and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payables, short-term
    debt and the current installments of long-term debt approximate
    carrying values due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. These items have been excluded from the table with
    the exception of the current installments of long-term debt.
    Additionally, certain noncurrent receivables, principally
    insurance recoverables, are carried at net realizable value.

The fair value of long-term debt is based on valuations from
    third-party banks and market quotations.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company is involved in legal and regulatory proceedings,
    lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of
    business, relating to such matters as product liability,
    contract, antitrust, intellectual property, workers’
    compensation, chemical exposure, prior acquisitions and
    divestitures, past waste disposal practices and release of
    chemicals into the environment. While it is impossible at this
    time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these
    proceedings, lawsuits and claims, the Company is actively
    defending those matters where the Company is named as a
    defendant. Additionally, the Company believes, based on the
    advice of legal counsel, that adequate reserves have been made
    and that the ultimate outcomes of all such litigation and claims
    will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
    position of the Company; however, the ultimate outcome of any
    given matter may have a material adverse impact on the results
    of operations or cash flows of the Company in any given
    reporting period.

Plumbing
    Actions

CNA Holdings LLC (“CNA Holdings”), a US subsidiary of
    the Company, which included the US business now conducted by the
    Ticona business that is included in the Advanced Engineered
    Materials segment, along with Shell Oil Company
    (“Shell”), E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company
    (“DuPont”) and others, has been a defendant in a
    series of lawsuits, including a number of class actions,
    alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were
    utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential
    property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail.
    Based on, among other things, the findings of outside experts
    and the successful use of Ticona’s acetal copolymer in
    similar applications, CNA Holdings does not believe
    Ticona’s acetal copolymer was defective or caused the
    plumbing systems to fail. In addition, in many cases CNA
    Holdings’ potential future exposure may be limited by
    invocation of the statute of limitations.

In November 1995, CNA Holdings, DuPont and Shell entered into
    national class action settlements that called for the
    replacement of plumbing systems of claimants who have had
    qualifying leaks, as well as reimbursements for



certain leak damage. In connection with such settlements, the
    three companies had agreed to fund these replacements and
    reimbursements up to an aggregate amount of $950 million.
    As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate funding is
    $1,111 million due to additional contributions and funding
    commitments made primarily by other parties. The time to file
    claims for the class in

Cox, et al. v. Hoechst Celanese
    Corporation, et al.

,

No. 94-0047

(Chancery Ct., Obion County, Tennessee) has now expired.
    Accordingly, the court ruled the terms of the Cox settlement
    have been fully performed. The entity previously established to
    administer all Cox related claims was dissolved on
    September 24, 2010.

During the period between 1995 and 2001, CNA Holdings was also
    named as a defendant in the following putative class actions:

•

Couture, et al. v. Shell Oil Company, et al.,

No. 200-06-000001-985

(Quebec Superior Court, Canada).

•

Dilday, et al. v. Hoechst Celanese Corporation, et al.,

    (British Columbia Supreme Court, Vancouver Registry, Canada).

•

Gariepy, et al. v. Shell Oil Company, et al., No. 30781/99
    (Ontario Court General Division, Canada) (pending final approval
    of nationwide Canadian class settlement).

•

    et al., No. 16809 (Chancery Ct., Weakley County, Tennessee).

    No. 1997/467 (Territorial Ct., St. Croix Division, the
    US Virgin Islands).

•

Tranter v. Shell Oil Company, et al., No. 46565/97
    (Ontario Court General Division, Canada).

On January 24, 2011 and February 7, 2011, the Chancery
    Court for Weakley County, Tennessee entered judgments in the
    Shelter General Insurance Co., et al., v. Shell Oil Company, et
    al., No. 16809 and the Dilday, et al. v. Hoechst Celanese
    Corporation, et al. No. 15187, respectively, dismissing
    with prejudice all claims against the Company.

The class actions in Canada are subject to a pending settlement
    that would result in the dismissal of those actions. In
    addition, between 1994 and 2008 CNA Holdings was named as a
    defendant in numerous actions of which three are actively
    pending. In all of these actions, the plaintiffs have sought
    recovery for alleged damages caused by leaking polybutylene
    plumbing. Damage amounts have generally not been specified but
    these actions generally do not involve (either individually or
    in the aggregate) a large number of homes.

The Company’s remaining plumbing action reserves recorded
    in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010
    and 2009 are $9 million and $55 million, respectively.
    The Company recorded recoveries and reductions in legal reserves

Plumbing
    Insurance Indemnifications

Celanese GmbH entered into agreements with insurance companies
    related to product liability settlements associated with
    plumbing action claims. These agreements, except those with
    insolvent insurance companies,



require the Company to indemnify

and/or

defend these insurance companies in the event that third parties
    seek additional monies for matters released in these agreements.
    The indemnifications in these agreements do not provide for time
    limitations.

In certain of the agreements, Celanese GmbH received a fixed
    settlement amount. The indemnities under these agreements
    generally are limited to, but in some cases are greater than,
    the amount received in settlement from the insurance company.
    The maximum exposure under some of these indemnifications is
    $95 million, while other settlement agreements with fixed
    settlement amounts have no stated indemnification limits.

There are other agreements whereby the settling insurer agreed
    to pay a fixed percentage of claims that relate to that
    insurer’s policies. The Company has provided
    indemnification to the insurers for amounts paid in excess of
    the settlement percentage. These indemnifications do not provide
    for monetary or time limitations.

Polyester
    Staple Antitrust Litigation

CNA Holdings, the successor in interest to Hoechst Celanese
    Corporation (“HCC”), Celanese Americas Corporation and
    Celanese GmbH (collectively, the “Celanese Entities”)
    and Hoechst, the former parent of HCC, were named as defendants
    in two actions (involving 25 individual participants) filed in
    September 2006 by US purchasers of polyester staple fibers
    manufactured and sold by HCC. The actions allege that the
    defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids
    and allocate customers of polyester staple sold in the United
    States. These actions were consolidated in a proceeding by a
    Multi-District Litigation Panel in the United States District
    Court for the Western District of North Carolina styled

In re
    Polyester Staple Antitrust Litigation

, MDL 1516. On
    June 12, 2008 the court dismissed these actions against all
    Celanese Entities in consideration of a payment by the Company
    of $107 million. This proceeding related to sales by the
    polyester staple fibers business which Hoechst sold to KoSa,
    Inc. in 1998. Accordingly, the impact of this settlement was
    reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
    2008. Prior to December 31, 2008, the Company had entered
    into tolling arrangements with four other alleged US purchasers
    of polyester staple fibers manufactured and sold by the Celanese
    Entities. These purchasers were not included in the settlement
    and one such company filed suit against the Company in December
    2008 in the Western District of North Carolina entitled

Milliken & Company v. CNA Holdings, Inc.,
    Celanese Americas Corporation and Hoechst AG

(No. 8-SV-00578).

The Company is actively defending this matter and has filed a
    motion to dismiss, which is pending with the court.

In December 1998, HCC sold its polyester staple business (the
    “1998 Sale”) to KoSa B.V., f/k/a Arteva B.V., a
    subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc. (“KoSa”), under an
    asset purchase agreement (“APA”). In August of 2002,
    Arteva Specialties, S.a.r.l., a subsidiary of KoSa (“Arteva
    Specialties”), pled guilty to a criminal violation of the
    Sherman Act relating to anti-competitive conduct following the
    1998 Sale. Shortly thereafter, various polyester staple
    customers filed approximately 50 civil anti-trust lawsuits
    against KoSa and Arteva Specialties, some of which alleged
    anti-competitive conduct prior to the 1998 Sale. In a complaint
    filed on November 3, 2003 in the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York,

Koch Industries,
    Inc. et al. v. Hoechst Aktiengellschaft et al.

,

No. 03-cv-8679,

Koch Industries, Inc., KoSa, Arteva Specialties and Arteva
    Services S.a.r.l. sought recovery from Hoechst and the Celanese
    Entities exceeding $371 million. In the complaint, the
    plaintiffs alleged claims of fraud, unjust enrichment and
    indemnification for retained liabilities and for breach of
    contractual representations and warranties under the APA. Both
    parties filed motions for summary judgment in 2009. On
    July 19, 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part
    the pending motions. The court dismissed the plaintiffs’
    claims for fraud and unjust enrichment, which also eliminated
    plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages. The court also
    held that the plaintiffs cannot recover damages for liabilities
    arising out of the operation of the polyester staple business
    incurred after the 1998 Sale but the plaintiffs can recover
    damages for the costs of defending and settling civil antitrust
    actions brought against them to the extent such damages arose
    out of the operation of the polyester staple business prior to
    the 1998 Sale (i.e., “Retained Liabilities” as defined
    in the APA). The plaintiffs alleged that they had paid
    approximately $135 million for the costs of settling and
    defending both pre- and post-1998 Sale civil antitrust actions.
    The court reserved for trial the calculation and allocation of
    any damages to which the plaintiffs would be entitled under the
    relevant sections of the APA. The court also preserved for trial
    the plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contractual
    representations and warranties under the APA. On
    November 3, 2010, the Company participated in a



mediation of this matter. Following mediation and during the
    quarter ended December 31, 2010, the parties settled the
    case pursuant to a confidential agreement. The settlement is a
    substantial portion of the amount recognized as Earnings (loss)
    from operations of discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations. On December 21, 2010, the case
    was dismissed with prejudice.

Other
    Commercial Actions

In April 2007, Southern Chemical Corporation
    (“Southern”) filed a petition in the 190th Judicial
    District Court of Harris County, Texas styled

Southern
    Chemical Corporation v. Celanese Ltd

. (Cause

No. 2007-25490),

seeking declaratory judgment relating to the terms of a
    multi-year supply contract. The trial court granted the
    Company’s motion for summary judgment in March 2008
    dismissing Southern’s claims. In September 2009, the
    intermediate Texas appellate court reversed the trial court
    decision and remanded the case to the trial court. The Texas
    Supreme Court subsequently declined both parties’ requests
    that it hear the case. On August 15, 2010, Southern filed a
    second amended petition adding a claim for breach of contract
    and seeking equitable damages in an unspecified amount from the
    Company. Southern amended its complaint again in November 2010.
    Trial has been set for August 2011. The Company believes that
    the contractual interpretations set forth by Southern lack merit
    and is actively defending the matter.

Acetic
    Acid Patent Infringement Matters

On May 9, 1999, Celanese International Corporation filed a
    private criminal action styled

Celanese International
    Corporation v. China Petrochemical Development Corporation

against China Petrochemical Development Corporation
    (“CPDC”) in the Taiwan Kaoshiung District Court
    alleging that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s patent covering the manufacture of acetic
    acid. Celanese International Corporation also filed a
    supplementary civil brief that, in view of changes in Taiwanese
    patent laws, was subsequently converted to a civil action
    alleging damages against CPDC based on a period of infringement
    of ten years,

1991-2000,

and based on CPDC’s own data that was reported to the
    Taiwanese securities and exchange commission. Celanese
    International Corporation’s patent was held valid by the
    Taiwanese patent office. On August 31, 2005, the District
    Court held that CPDC infringed Celanese International
    Corporation’s acetic acid patent and awarded Celanese
    International Corporation approximately $28 million (plus
    interest) for the period of 1995 through 1999. In October 2008,
    the High Court, on appeal, reversed the District Court’s
    $28 million award to the Company. The Company appealed to
    the Superior Court in November 2008, and the court remanded the
    case to the Intellectual Property Court in June 2009. On
    January 16, 2006, the District Court awarded Celanese
    International Corporation $800,000 (plus interest) for the year
    1990. In January 2009, the High Court, on appeal, affirmed the
    District Court’s award and CPDC appealed on
    February 5, 2009 to the Supreme Court. During the quarter
    ended March 31, 2010, this case was remanded to the
    Intellectual Property Court. In August 2010, the Intellectual
    Property Court ruled in CPDC’s favor and Celanese filed an
    appeal to the Supreme Court. On June 29, 2007, the District
    Court awarded Celanese International Corporation
    $60 million (plus interest) for the period of 2000 through
    2005. CPDC appealed this ruling and in July 2009, the High Court
    ruled in CPDC’s favor. The Company appealed to the Supreme
    Court and in December 2009, the case was remanded to the
    Intellectual Property Court.

Workers
    Compensation Claims

The Company has been provided with notices of claims filed with
    the South Carolina Workers’ Compensation Commission and the
    North Carolina Industrial Commission. The notices of claims
    identify various alleged injuries to current and former
    employees arising from alleged exposure to undefined chemicals
    at current and former plant sites in South Carolina and North
    Carolina. As of December 31, 2010, there were 1,350 claims
    pending. The Company has reserves for defense costs related to
    these matters.



Asbestos
    Claims

The Company and several of its US subsidiaries are defendants in
    asbestos cases. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    asbestos case activity is as follows:

Asbestos Cases

As of December 31, 2009


Case adjustments


New cases filed


Resolved cases

(70)

As of December 31, 2010


Because many of these cases involve numerous plaintiffs, the
    Company is subject to claims significantly in excess of the
    number of actual cases. The Company has reserves for defense
    costs related to claims arising from these matters.

Award
    Proceedings in relation to Domination Agreement and
    Squeeze-Out

On October 1, 2004, Celanese GmbH and the Company’s
    subsidiary, BCP Holdings GmbH (“BCP Holdings”), a
    German limited liability company, entered into a Domination
    Agreement pursuant to which the BCP Holdings became obligated to
    offer to acquire all outstanding Celanese GmbH shares from the
    minority shareholders of Celanese GmbH in return for payment of
    fair cash compensation (the “Purchaser Offer”). The
    amount of this fair cash compensation was determined to be
    €41.92 per share in accordance with applicable German law.
    All minority shareholders who elected not to sell their shares
    to the BCP Holdings under the Purchaser Offer were entitled to
    remain shareholders of Celanese GmbH and to receive from the BCP
    Holdings a gross guaranteed annual payment of €3.27 per
    Celanese GmbH share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any
    dividend.

As of March 30, 2005, several minority shareholders of
    Celanese GmbH had initiated special award proceedings seeking
    the court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash
    compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered in the
    Purchaser Offer under the Domination Agreement. In the Purchaser
    Offer, 145,387 shares were tendered at the fair cash
    compensation of €41.92, and 924,078 shares initially
    remained outstanding and were entitled to the guaranteed annual
    payment under the Domination Agreement. As a result of these
    proceedings, the amount of the fair cash consideration and the
    guaranteed annual payment paid under the Domination Agreement
    could be increased by the court so that all minority
    shareholders, including those who have already tendered their
    shares in the Purchaser Offer for the fair cash compensation,
    could claim the respective higher amounts. On December 12,
    2006, the court of first instance appointed an expert to assist
    the court in determining the value of Celanese GmbH.

On May 30, 2006 the majority shareholder of Celanese GmbH
    adopted a squeeze-out resolution under which all outstanding
    shares held by minority shareholders should be transferred to
    BCP Holdings for a fair cash compensation of €66.99 per
    share (the “Squeeze-Out”). This shareholder resolution
    was challenged by shareholders but the Squeeze-Out became
    effective after the disputes were settled on December 22,
    2006. Award proceedings were subsequently filed by
    79 shareholders against BCP Holdings with the Frankfurt
    District Court requesting the court to set a higher amount for
    the Squeeze-Out compensation.

Pursuant to a settlement agreement between BCP Holdings and
    certain former Celanese GmbH shareholders, if the court sets a
    higher value for the fair cash compensation or the guaranteed
    payment under the Purchaser Offer or the Squeeze-Out
    compensation, former Celanese GmbH shareholders who ceased to be
    shareholders of Celanese GmbH due to the Squeeze-Out will be
    entitled to claim for their shares the higher of the
    compensation amounts determined by the court in these different
    proceedings related to the Purchaser Offer and the Squeeze-Out.
    If the fair cash compensation determined by the court is higher
    than the Squeeze-Out compensation of € 66.99, then
    1,069,465 shares will be entitled to an adjustment. If the
    court confirms the value of the fair cash compensation under the
    Domination Agreement but determines a higher value for the
    Squeeze-Out compensation, 924,078 shares



would be entitled to an adjustment. Payments already received by
    these shareholders as compensation for their shares will be
    offset so that persons who ceased to be shareholders of Celanese
    GmbH due to the Squeeze-Out are not entitled to more than the
    higher of the amount set in the two court proceedings.

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties
    for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of
    agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements,
    leases, settlement agreements and various agreements with
    affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, others do not provide such limitations.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the occurrence of
    unpredictable future events, the future costs associated with
    them cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably
    estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims
    that have been brought to its attention. These known obligations
    include the following:

•

Demerger Obligations

In connection with the Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to
    indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, for various
    liabilities under the Demerger Agreement, including for
    environmental liabilities associated with contamination arising
    under 19 divestiture agreements entered into by Hoechst prior to
    the demerger.

The Company’s obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its
    legal successors, for environmental liabilities associated with
    contamination arising under these 19 divestiture agreements is
    subject to the following thresholds:

•

The Company will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors,
    against those liabilities up to €250 million;

•

Hoechst, and its legal successors, will bear those liabilities
    exceeding €250 million; provided, however, that the
    Company will reimburse Hoechst, and its legal successors, for
    one-third of liabilities exceeding €750 million in the
    aggregate.

The aggregate maximum amount of environmental indemnifications
    under the remaining divestiture agreements that provide for
    monetary limits is approximately €750 million. Three
    of the divestiture agreements do not provide for monetary
    limits. Cumulative payments under the divestiture agreements are
    as follows:

As of December 31,



(In $ millions)

Total



Based on the estimate of the probability of loss under this
    indemnification, the Company had reserves of $36 million as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009 for this contingency. Where
    the Company is unable to reasonably determine the probability of
    loss or estimate such loss under an indemnification, the Company
    has not recognized any related liabilities.

The Company has also undertaken in the Demerger Agreement to
    indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for
    (i) one-third of any and all liabilities that result from
    Hoechst being held as the responsible party pursuant to public
    law or current or future environmental law or by third parties
    pursuant to private or public law relates to contamination and
    (ii) liabilities that Hoechst is required to discharge,
    including tax liabilities, which are associated with businesses
    that were included in the demerger but were not demerged due to
    legal restrictions on the transfers of such items. These
    indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time limitations.
    The Company has not provided for any significant reserves
    associated with this indemnification as it is not probable or
    estimable. The Company has made payments to Hoechst and its
    legal successors of less than $1 million and
    $0 million during the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, in connection with this indemnification.



•

Divestiture Obligations

The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify
    third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for
    various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also
    include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust
    and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees
    represent standard contractual terms associated with typical
    divestiture agreements and, other than environmental
    liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the
    Company to any significant risk. As of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company had reserves in the aggregate of
    $26 million and $28 million, respectively, for these
    matters.

The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and
    facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or
    guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain
    monetary

and/or

time
    limitations, ranging from one year to thirty years. The
    aggregate amount of guarantees provided for under these
    agreements is approximately $205 million as of
    December 31, 2010. Other agreements do not provide for any
    monetary or time limitations.

•

Purchase Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    commitments to purchase goods and services over a fixed period
    of time. The Company maintains a number of

“take-or-pay”

contracts for purchases of raw materials, utilities and other
    services. As of December 31, 2010, there were outstanding
    future commitments of $1.6 billion under

take-or-pay

contracts. The Company recognized $3 million of losses
    related to

take-or-pay

contract termination costs for the year ended December 31,
    2010 related to the Company’s Pardies, France “Project
    of Closure” (Note 4 and Note 17). The Company
    does not expect to incur any material losses under

take-or-pay

contractual arrangements. Additionally, as of December 31,
    2010, there were other outstanding commitments of
    $308 million representing maintenance and service
    agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts
    and software agreements.

During March 2010, the Company successfully completed an amended
    raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who had filed
    for bankruptcy. Under the original contract, the Company made
    advance payments in exchange for preferential pricing on certain
    volumes of material purchases over the life of the contract. The
    cancellation of the original contract and the terms of the
    subsequent amendment resulted in the Company accelerating
    amortization on the unamortized prepayment balance of
    $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
    The accelerated amortization was recorded to Cost of sales in
    the consolidated statements of operations as follows:
    $20 million was recorded in the Acetyl Intermediates
    segment and $2 million was recorded in the Advanced
    Engineered Materials segment.

Ticona
    Kelsterbach Plant Relocation

In November 2006, the Company finalized a settlement agreement
    with the Frankfurt, Germany Airport (“Fraport”) to
    relocate the Kelsterbach, Germany Ticona operations, included in
    the Advanced Engineered Materials segment, resolving several
    years of legal disputes related to the planned Fraport
    expansion. As a result of the settlement, the Company will
    transition Ticona’s operations from Kelsterbach to the
    Hoechst Industrial Park in the Rhine Main area in Germany. Under
    the original agreement, Fraport agreed to pay the Company a
    total of €670 million over a five-year period to
    offset costs associated with the transition of the operations
    from its current location and the closure of the Kelsterbach
    plant. The Company subsequently decided to expand the scope of
    the new production facilities.



In February 2009, the Company announced the Fraport supervisory
    board approved the acceleration of the 2009 and 2010 payments of
    €200 million and €140 million, respectively,
    required by the settlement agreement signed in June 2007. In
    February 2009, the Company received a discounted amount of
    €322 million ($412 million) under this agreement.
    In addition, the Company received €59 million
    ($75 million) in value-added tax from Fraport which was
    remitted to the tax authorities in April 2009. Amounts received
    from Fraport are accounted for as deferred proceeds and are
    included in noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets. The Kelsterbach, Germany Ticona operations are
    included in the Advanced Engineered Materials segment.

A summary of the financial statement impact associated with the
    Ticona Kelsterbach plant relocation is as follows:

    Insurance Recoveries

Due to certain events in October 2008 and subsequent periodic
    cessations of production of the Company’s specialty
    polymers products produced at its EVA Performance Polymers
    facility in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the Company declared two
    events of force majeure. During 2009, the Company replaced
    long-lived assets damaged in October 2008. As a result of these
    events and subsequent periodic cessation of production, the
    Company recorded $25 million and $10 million of
    insurance recoveries during the year ended December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, in the Company’s Industrial
    Specialties segment. These amounts were partially offset by
    $7 million and $10 million, respectively, recorded as
    a charge by the Company’s Captives included in the Other
    Activities segment. The net insurance recoveries of
    $18 million recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 consisted of $8 million related to
    property damage and $10 million related to business
    interruption. The net insurance recoveries are included in Other
    (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of
    operations (Note 17).

In May 2007, the Company announced that it had an unplanned
    outage at its Clear Lake, Texas acetic acid facility. At that
    time, the Company originally expected the outage to last until
    the end of May. Upon restart of the facility, additional
    operating issues were identified which necessitated an extension
    of the outage for further, more extensive repairs. In July 2007,
    the Company announced that the further repairs were unsuccessful
    on restart of the unit. All repairs were completed in early
    August 2007 and normal production capacity resumed. During the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    recorded $0 million, $6 million and $38 million,
    respectively, of insurance recoveries from its reinsurers in
    partial satisfaction of claims that the Company made based on
    losses resulting from the outage. These insurance recoveries are
    included in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated
    statements of operations (Note 17).

30.
    Consolidating Guarantor Financial Information

In September 2010, the Company completed the issuance of the
    Notes (Note 13) by Celanese US (the
    “Issuer”). The Notes are guaranteed by Celanese
    Corporation (the “Parent Guarantor”) and substantially
    all of its US subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary
    Guarantors”). For cash management purposes, the Company
    transfers cash between Parent Guarantor, Issuer, Subsidiary
    Guarantors and non-guarantors through intercompany financing
    arrangements or



declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its
    subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities
    facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified
    third-party payments. As a result, the Company presents such
    intercompany financing activities and dividends within the
    category where the ultimate use of cash to third parties is
    presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash
    flows. The consolidating financial statements for the Parent
    Guarantor, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the
    non-guarantors are as follows:
