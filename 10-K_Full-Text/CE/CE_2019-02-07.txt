Our two wholly-owned captive insurance companies are a key component of our global risk management program, as well as a form of self-insurance for our liability and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance companies retain risk at levels approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained. One of the captive insurance companies also insures certain third-party risks. Other Activities also includes the interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses components of our net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans, which are not allocated to our business segments. Ongoing merger, acquisition and integration related costs are also included in Other Activities.



Strategic Affiliates

Our strategic affiliates represent an important component of our strategy for accelerated growth and global expansion. We have a substantial portfolio of affiliates in various regions, including Asia-Pacific, North America and the Middle East. These affiliates, some of which date back as far as the 1960s, have sizeable operations and are significant within their industries.

With shared characteristics such as products, applications and manufacturing technology, these strategic affiliates complement and extend our technology and specialty materials portfolio. We have historically entered into these investments to gain access to local demand, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant future business potential.

Our strategic affiliates contribute substantial earnings and cash flows to us. During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, our equity method strategic affiliates generated combined sales of

$2.6 billion

, resulting in our recording

$203 million

of equity in net earnings of affiliates and

$187 million

of dividends.

Our strategic affiliates

as of

December 31, 2018

are as follows:

National Methanol Company (Ibn Sina).

National Methanol Company represents approximately 1% of the world's methanol production capacity and is one of the world's largest producers of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, a gasoline additive. Its production facilities are located in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Basic Industries Corporation ("SABIC") is responsible for all product marketing. Methanol is a key feedstock for POM production and is produced by our Ibn Sina affiliate which provides an economic hedge against raw material costs in our engineered materials business.

Ibn Sina constructed a 50,000 metric ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia. The facility supplies POM to support Engineered Materials' future growth plans as well as our venture partners' regional business development and was declared commercially operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our indirect economic interest in Ibn Sina increased from 25% to 32.5%.

KEPCO.

KEPCO is the leading producer of POM in South Korea. KEPCO has polyacetal production facilities in Ulsan, South Korea, compounding facilities for PBT and nylon in Pyongtaek, South Korea, and participates with Polyplastics and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM facility in Nantong, China.

Polyplastics.

Polyplastics is a leading supplier of engineered plastics. Polyplastics is a manufacturer and/or marketer of POM, LCP and PPS, with principal production facilities located in Japan and Malaysia.

Fortron Industries LLC.

Fortron Industries LLC ("Fortron") is a leading global producer of PPS, sold under the Fortron

®

brand, which is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications, especially those requiring heat and/or chemical resistance. Fortron's facility is located in Wilmington, North Carolina. This venture combines our sales, marketing, distribution, compounding and manufacturing expertise with the PPS polymer technology expertise of Kureha America Inc.



Acetate Tow strategic ventures.

Our Acetate Tow ventures generally fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay dividends based on each ventures' performance in the preceding year. In


,


and


, we received cash dividends of

$112 million

,

$107 million

and

$107 million

, respectively.

Although our ownership interest in each of our Acetate Tow ventures exceeds 20%, we account for these investments at cost after considering observable price changes for similar instruments, minus impairment, if any, because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on our involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Further, these investments were determined not to have a readily determinable fair value.

Other Equity Method Investments

InfraServs.

We hold indirect ownership interests in several German InfraServ Groups that own and develop industrial parks and provide various technical and administrative services to tenants. Our ownership interest in the equity investments in InfraServ affiliates are as follows:

Intellectual Property

We attach importance to protecting our intellectual property, including safeguarding our confidential information and through our patents, trademarks and copyrights, in order to preserve our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Patents may cover processes, equipment, products, intermediate products and product uses. We also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our Company and products.

Patents.

In most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new substances and formulations, as well as for certain unique applications and production processes. However, we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce.

Confidential Information.

We maintain stringent information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. Such information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information and trade secrets, as well as employee awareness training.

Employees

Our employees employed on a continuing basis throughout the world are as follows:

Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of net sales or financial performance.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Many factors could have an effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results

of operations. We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic,

environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions. The factors

described below represent our principal risks.

Risks Related to Our Business

We are exposed to general

economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we

have operations and customers.

We operate globally and have customers in many countries. Our major facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe and Asia, and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the United States ("US"), Germany, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by world economic conditions, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment.

Our operations are also subject to global political conditions. For example, any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements, or the failure to reach agreement over trade agreements, or the imposition of new or increased tariffs on our products or raw materials, or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like China, may increase costs or reduce profitability, or adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements, collect receivables, receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems. In certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Furthermore, in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings, such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies.

We have invested significant resources in China and other Asian countries. This region's growth may slow, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and, consequently, our financial results may be adversely impacted.

In addition, we have significant operations and financial relationships based in Europe. Historically, sales originating in Europe have accounted for over one-third of our net sales. For example, in


, sales originating in Europe accounted for approximately 40% of our net sales. Adverse conditions in the European economy related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ("EU") membership or otherwise may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting in decreased end-use customer demand.

We are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and

availability of key raw materials and energy, which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results.

We purchase significant amounts of ethylene, methanol, carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in our intermediate chemistry business, principally acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer ("VAM") and formaldehyde. We use a portion of our output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments. We also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our emulsion polymers and EVA polymer businesses, primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production, as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of acetate tow. The price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with war, terrorist activities, civil unrest, epidemics, pandemics, weather, natural disasters, the effects of climate change or political instability, plant or production disruptions, strikes or other labor unrest, breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of raw materials and energy commodities, or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers. In particular, to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals, shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals, such as natural gas, ethylene and methanol, or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide, may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products. Such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results.



We are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy. Although we have long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene, methanol, carbon monoxide, wood pulp, natural gas and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile. In addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price, factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include:

•

Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from growing uses or new uses;

•

Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, labor disruption, involuntary shutdowns or turnarounds;

•

The inability of a supplier to meet our delivery orders or a supplier's choice not to fulfill orders or to terminate a supply contract or our inability to obtain or renew supply contracts on favorable terms;

•

The general level of business and economic activity; and

•

The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation (including the impact of government regulation relating to climate change).

If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs, or if such commodities become unavailable, it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results.

We have a practice of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services. However, some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials, such as carbon monoxide, steam and ethylene, or site services. Although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services, there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service, there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier. Furthermore, if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time, we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs. It is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier.

Almost all of our supply of methanol in North America is currently obtained from our joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC ("Fairway"), with Mitsui & Co., Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan, in which we own a 50% interest, for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas.

Production at our manufacturing facilities, or at our suppliers', could be disrupted for a variety of

reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our

sales and satisfy our customers' demands.

A disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities, or our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, disease, strikes or other labor unrest, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers' needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. In particular, production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments, such as acetic acid, VAM and formaldehyde, could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration. Furthermore, to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption.

Failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement

productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully, may harm our competitive

position.

Our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products, product grades and applications, as well as process technologies, free of any legal restrictions. If we are unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and production processes in the future, including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our Engineered



Materials segment, our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected. However, as we invest in new technology, we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties, including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals, the development of competing technologies, failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations, construction delays, cost over-runs, the unavailability of financing, required materials or equipment and various other factors. Likewise, we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings. These initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls, which

could adversely affect our financial condition and performance.

The development, manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us, including products produced for the food and beverage, cigarette, automobile, construction, aerospace, medical device and pharmaceutical industries, involves a risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. A product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in our products, and divert management's attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Although we have standard contracting policies and controls, we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls.

We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications.

Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers' products. If one of our products fails to perform in a manner consistent with applicable quality specifications, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers.

Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual

property rights and our rights to use our intellectual property. Our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our

ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins.

We rely on our patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products. We have adopted internal policies for protecting our know-how and trade secrets. In addition, our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses. Patents may cover catalysts, processes, products, intermediate products and product uses. These patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application. The legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection. As patents expire, the catalysts, processes, products, intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated know-how and trade secrets. We also monitor intellectual property of others, especially patents that could impact our rights to commercially implement research and development, our rights to manufacture and market our products, and our rights to use know-how and trade secrets. We will not intentionally infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others, and we will continue to assess and take actions as necessary to protect our positions. We also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired. We operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges. We also monitor the trademarks of others and take action when our trademark rights are being infringed upon. If we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property rights, or protecting our rights to commercially make, market and sell our products, our net sales, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.



Our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our

suppliers, customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers, customers and business partners

participate are cyclical in nature, both of which may adversely affect

our business and results of operations.

Our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers' products. These risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Furthermore, some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries, are highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use applications, and may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products. In addition, many of these industries are cyclical in nature, thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition.

Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations and/or changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole.

We are subject to extensive international, national, state, local and other laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, including antitrust and anticorruption laws, rules, regulations or court decisions, could expose us to fines, penalties and other costs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and court decisions, there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws, rules, regulations and court decisions, which could result in fines, penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation.

Moreover, changes in laws or regulations, including the more aggressive enforcement of such laws and regulations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements (including import or export licensing requirements), or changes in reporting requirements of the US, Canadian, Mexican, German, EU or Asian governmental agencies, could increase the cost of doing business in these regions. In addition, enforcement of environmental or other governmental policy may result in plant shut downs or significantly decreased production, such as in China on high pollution days. Any of these conditions, including the failure to obtain or maintain operating permits for our business, may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our products and raw materials.

Environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters

could subject us to liability for fines, clean-ups and other damages, require

us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing

and delivery costs.

Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us, may have a significant negative impact on our operating results. We also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between Celanese GmbH and Hoechst AG for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger.

Our operations are subject to extensive international, national, state, local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters. We incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements. If we violate any one of those laws or regulations, we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions, including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations. Consequently, compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period. See

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources

for further information.

Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we

manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our

products.

New or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health, safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products. In addition, products we produce, including VAM, formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde, may be classified and labeled in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products. For example, in 2012 the International Agency for Research on Cancer ("IARC"), a research agency within the World Health Organization, classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) based on epidemiological studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer in humans, and leukemia. In



2011, a similar conclusion was reached by the National Toxicology Program ("NTP"), a U.S. inter-agency research program. We anticipate that the results of the IARC's and the NTP's reviews will continue to be examined and considered by government regulatory agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements.

Other initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives include the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act which amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the United States primary chemicals management law, as well as various European Commission regulatory programs, such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), and new initiatives in Asia and other regions. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional regulatory requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling and/or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Our production facilities, including facilities we own and/or operate and operations at our facilities owned and/or operated by third parties, handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous

materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our

operating results.

Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of, and minimize the disruption to, our operations and operations at our facilities owned and/or operated by third parties, we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing, including the storage and transportation of raw materials, finished products and waste. These risks include, among other things, pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances. In addition, we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned and/or operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs.

These operating and other risks can cause personal injury, property damage, third-party damages and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, our operating results and cash flows.

US federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production

plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future, if passed

into law, may increase

our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations.

The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program ("CFATS Program"), which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the US. In December 2014, the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 ("CFATS Act") was enacted. The CFATS Act reauthorizes the CFATS Program for four years. The CFATS Extension Act of 2019 ("HR 251") was signed into law by the President on January 19, 2019. HR 251 extends CFATS for 15 months, until April 19, 2020. This extension does not make any changes to the program and is intended to provide lawmakers the needed time to discuss improvements to CFATS and provides for a longer term authorization. DHS has released an interim final rule under the CFATS Program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for high-risk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest. This rule establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of our nation's chemical facilities. It requires covered chemical facilities to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments, which identify facility security vulnerabilities, and to develop and implement Site Security Plans, which include measures that satisfy the identified risk-based performance standards. We cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that DHS may require.

We are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation,

regulation and international accords.

Greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions and cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the EU. In addition, regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation. As such, future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible, which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs.



Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and

regulatory proceedings.

We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period. See

Note 16 - Environmental

and

Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Changes in, or the interpretation of, tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results.

Our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates EU state aid rules. In addition, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, a number of countries where we do business, including the US and many countries in the EU, have changed or are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

On December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted and was effective January 1, 2018. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, which requires companies to recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment. This overhaul of the US tax law made a number of substantial changes, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, establishing a dividends received deduction for dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the US, elimination or limitation of certain deductions (interest, domestic production activities and executive compensation), imposing a mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 and establishing global minimum income tax and base erosion tax provisions related to offshore activities and affiliated party payments. Due to the timing and significance of the TCJA, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided registrants a measurement period through 2018 to report the impact of the new US tax law.

The US Treasury issued several proposed regulations supplementing the TCJA in 2018. These proposed regulations are intended to be applicable retroactively and would not materially impact our 2018 tax rate if finalized in current form. We currently do not expect them to have a material impact on income tax expense upon final adoption. See

Note 19 - Income Taxes

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, expirations of tax holidays or rulings, changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. We are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. Examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. It is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

Our significant non-US operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that

could adversely impact our profitability.

We conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the US. Consequently, fluctuations in currencies of other countries, especially the Euro, may materially affect our operating results. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into US dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. Therefore, increases or



decreases in the value of the US dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions. These changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors.

In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary's functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the US dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively.

We use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures. We cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective. In addition, the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk. Failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business.

We have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats. While some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs, we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business. We seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, mis-use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position, cause operational disruption, reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees', customers' or vendors' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including monitoring of our systems and networks, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business. In addition, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results.

Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the

identification and development of talent to succeed senior management.

We rely heavily on our management team. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of our reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies.

Significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to

pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations,

the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost.

The cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time. Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions, which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations. The combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. In recent years, an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates. If the funded status of a pension plan declines, we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned.



Some of our employees are unionized, represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the US.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

7,684

employees globally. Approximately

16%

of our

2,693

US-based employees are unionized. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the US. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements. Most of our employees in Europe are represented by workers councils and/or unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment, including potentially salaries and benefits. They may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives, a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown by our employees could occur, resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as any stockholders' rights plan, may discourage a takeover attempt.

Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock"). These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our Company. In addition, a change of control of our Company may be delayed or deterred as a result of any stockholders' rights plan that our Board of Directors may adopt. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.

We may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility.

We periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility. We also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised, we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations. The closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant. See

Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or joint venture transactions or successfully integrate them into our business, which could adversely affect our business or results

of operations.

As part of our growth strategy, we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities. Successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates, the ability to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to consummate a planned transaction, and by our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. Acquisitions and joint venture transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulty determining appropriate valuation, integrating operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired lines or businesses, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business matters. In addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these transactions in the time frame that we anticipate, or at all, which could adversely affect our business or results of operations.

The insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks.

We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In the future, the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost.



Differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans, which may adversely affect our results of operations.

We currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties. Differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to

fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the

chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our

indebtedness.

See

Note 14 - Debt

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness. See

Note 13 - Noncurrent Other Liabilities

,

Note 15 - Benefit Obligations

and

Note 16 - Environmental

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations.

Our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences, including:

•

Increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including exacerbating the impact of any adverse business effects that are determined to be material adverse events under our existing senior credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") or our indentures (the "Indentures") governing our

€300 million

in aggregate principal amount of

3.250%

senior unsecured notes due 2019,

$400 million

in aggregate principal amount of

5.875%

senior unsecured notes due 2021,

$500 million

in aggregate principal amount of

4.625%

senior unsecured notes due 2022,

€750 million

in aggregate principal amount of

1.125%

senior unsecured notes due 2023,

€300 million

in aggregate principal amount of

1.250%

senior unsecured notes due 2025 and

€500 million

in aggregate principal amount of

2.125%

senior unsecured notes due 2027 (collectively, the "Senior Notes");

•

Requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness and amounts payable in connection with the satisfaction of our other liabilities, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends on our Common Stock;

•

Exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

Exposing us to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates as certain of our borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies;

•

Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;

•

Limiting our ability to enter into certain commercial arrangements because of concerns of counterparty risks; and

•

Limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.

We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could increase

the risks described above.

Although covenants under the Credit Agreement and the Indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our debt described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, including the Senior Notes, would increase.

Our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, which could cause

our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating

results.

Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated, which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk, respectively. See

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and



Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources

,

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

below and

Note 22 - Derivative Financial Instruments

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may

be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness, which

may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in

certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our

indebtedness or pay dividends.

The Credit Agreement, the Indentures and the Receivables Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. The Credit Agreement contains covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt; incur liens securing debt; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with any other person; and sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuer's assets or the assets of its subsidiaries.

In addition, the Indentures limit Celanese US Holdings LLC ("Celanese US") and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur liens securing debt; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with any other person; and sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Celanese US's assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries.

The Purchase Agreement also contains covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on CE Receivables LLC, a wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary of the Company, and certain other Company subsidiaries' ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate, or sell certain assets; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; and engage in other businesses.

Such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the Senior Notes in order to take certain actions. Disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents. Our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, a default under the Credit Agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend. If the lenders under the Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. In such event, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

Celanese and Celanese US are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy

their obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of Celanese US's obligations

under the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement by Celanese.

As holding companies, Celanese and Celanese US conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries, which own substantially all of our consolidated assets. Consequently, the principal source of cash to pay Celanese and Celanese US's obligations, including obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of Celanese US's obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Indentures by Celanese, is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations. We cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable Celanese US and/or Celanese to make



payments in respect of their obligations. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable country or state laws, regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to Celanese US and Celanese. While the Credit Agreement and the Indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits. In the event Celanese US and/or Celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, Celanese US and/or Celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, the Indentures, the guarantee of Celanese US's obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Indentures by Celanese, or our other indebtedness.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "our" and "us," refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term "Celanese US" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP").

Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and other parts of this Annual Report involve both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below.

Forward-Looking Statements

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") and other parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Generally, words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "may," "can," "could," "might," and "will," and similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views and beliefs with respect to future events at the time that the statements are made, are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. See "

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

•

various other factors, both referenced and not referenced in this Annual Report.

Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates.

Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-07,

Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost

, which clarifies the presentation and classification of the components of net periodic benefit costs in the consolidated statements of operations. See

Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Also during the year ended December 31, 2018, we reorganized our operating and reportable segments to align with recent structural and management reporting changes. These changes reflect: (1) the movement of our food ingredients business from the Consumer Specialties reportable segment into our Engineered Materials reportable segment, (2) the renaming of the former Consumer Specialties reportable segment as the Acetate Tow segment, (3) the renaming of the former Advanced Engineered Materials reportable segment as the Engineered Materials segment and (4) the combination of the former Industrial Specialties and former Acetyl Intermediates operating and reportable segments into the Acetyl Chain operating and reportable segment. See

Note 26 - Segment Information

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Consolidated Results

Year Ended December 31, 2018

Compared to

Year Ended December 31, 2017

Net sales

increased

$1.0 billion

, or

16.5%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

higher pricing in our Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials segments; and

•

higher volume in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to our base business driven by new project launches and pipeline growth, and Net sales generated from acquisitions. See

Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased

$50 million

, or

10.1%

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

an increase in functional spending and incentive compensation costs of $42 million in Other Activities.

Operating profit

increased

$477 million

, or

55.7%

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

higher Net sales in our Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials segments; and

•

a favorable impact of

$63 million

to Other (charges) gains, net in our Acetyl Chain segment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided notice of termination of a contract with a key raw materials supplier at our ethanol production unit in Nanjing, China. As a result, we recorded a

$22 million

contract termination charge and a

$21 million

reduction to our non-income tax receivable, which did not recur in the current year. In addition, during the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we received a

$13 million

non-income tax receivable refund from Nanjing, China. See

Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;

partially offset by:

•

higher raw material costs across all of our segments;

•

higher spending of

$72 million

and

$34 million

in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments, respectively; and

•

an increase in SG&A expenses.

Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates

increased

$50 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

an increase in equity investment in earnings of $38 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate primarily as a result of an increase in our indirect economic ownership from 25% to 32.5% due to the startup of its polyoxymethylene ("POM") production facility in Saudi Arabia during the three months ended December 31, 2017.



Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expense increased

$106 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

an increase in recognized actuarial loss of

$119 million

as a result of lower asset returns, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from

3.3%

to

3.8%

.

Our effective tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2018

was

19%

compared to

20%

for the year ended


. The effective tax rate for 2018 was slightly less than the statutory US tax rate primarily due to the positive impact from our jurisdictional mix of earnings, largely offset by increased valuation allowances established on certain deferred tax assets, particularly related to increases in provisionally recorded estimates of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits in the US and net operating loss carryforwards in Luxembourg, due to certain restructuring transactions completed to facilitate future repatriation of cash to the US.

On December 31, 2017, the TCJA was enacted and was effective January 1, 2018. Due to the timing and significance of the TCJA, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided registrants a measurement period through 2018 to report the impact of the new US tax law.

In 2017, we previously recorded provisional amounts for several of the impacts of the new tax law including: the deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits, the deferred tax rate change effect of the new law, gross foreign tax credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances to offset foreign tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the TCJA, including the proposed 2018 clarifying guidance. See

Note 19 - Income Taxes

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Year Ended December 31, 2017

Compared to

Year Ended December 31, 2016

Net sales

increased

$751 million

, or

13.9%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2017

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

higher volume in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to Net sales generated from SO.F.TER. S.r.l. ("SOFTER") and from the nylon compounding division of Nilit Group ("Nilit"), as well as within our base business, which was driven by new project launches and pipeline growth globally; and

•

higher pricing for most of our products in our Acetyl Chain segment;

partially offset by:

•

lower acetate tow pricing and volume in our Acetate Tow segment; and

•

lower volume for ethanol in our Acetyl Chain segment.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased

$118 million

, or

31.2%

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

an increase in spending of approximately $100 million in our Engineered Materials segment and Other Activities primarily related to ongoing merger, acquisition and integration related costs.

Operating profit

decreased

$77 million

, or

8.2%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2017

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

higher raw material costs, primarily in our Acetyl Chain segment;

•

higher plant spending of

$138 million

in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to our acquisitions of SOFTER and Nilit, as these acquired businesses incurred ongoing plant spending;

•

an increase in SG&A expenses; and



•

an unfavorable impact of

$47 million

to Other (charges) gains, net in our Acetyl Chain segment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided notice of termination of a contract with a key raw materials supplier at our ethanol production unit in Nanjing, China. As a result, we recorded a

$22 million

contract termination charge and a

$21 million

reduction to our non-income tax receivable. See

Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;

partially offset by:

•

higher Net sales in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments; and

•

cost savings in our Acetyl Chain and Acetate Tow segments, primarily due to productivity initiatives.

Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates

increased

$28 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

an increase in equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates of

$20 million

from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate as a result of higher pricing and timing of turnaround activity.

Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit income

increased

$85 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

compared to the same period in


primarily due to:

•

a decrease in recognized actuarial loss of

$57 million

as a result of higher asset returns, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from

3.7%

to

3.3%

.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2017

was

20%

compared to

12%

for the year ended


. The 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. We recognized net tax expense of

$197 million

in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings accumulated offshore since 1986. This expense of $197 million was partially offset by a $107 million reduction of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of lowering the US tax rate from 35% to 21% and other technical provisions in the TCJA. We also recognized a net tax benefit of $76 million related to foreign tax credits generated as a result of various reorganization transactions to separate certain Acetate Tow assets to reorganize the holdings of its various foreign subsidiaries. No material cash impact is expected from the deemed repatriation due to existing foreign tax credit carryforwards. The 2016 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted primarily due to settlement of uncertain tax positions and technical clarifications in Germany and the US of

$55 million

. See

Note 19 - Income Taxes

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

In June 2017, Celanese, through various subsidiaries, entered into an agreement with affiliates of the Blackstone Group L.P. (the "Blackstone Entities") to form a joint venture which combines substantially all of the operations of our Acetate Tow business and the operations of the Rhodia Acetow cellulose acetate business formerly operated by Solvay S.A. and acquired by the Blackstone Entities in June 2017. The parties were subsequently unable to reach an agreement with the European Commission on acceptable conditions to allow the proposed joint venture to proceed. The demands by the European Commission eliminated the primary advantages of the transaction. As a result, on March 19, 2018, we and the Blackstone Entities abandoned our agreement to form the proposed joint venture.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, as of

December 31, 2018

we have

$960 million

available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and

$14 million

available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations.

While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the next twelve months. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels.

Total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million in 2019 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments.

On a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, Celanese US, have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese US in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock").

We are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate, such as China, India, and Indonesia. Capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies, repatriate earnings or capital, lend via intercompany loans or create cross-border cash pooling arrangements. Our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in China. Pursuant to applicable regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the Chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of China, puts certain limitations on duration, purpose and amount of intercompany loans, and restricts cross-border cash pooling.

Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents

decreased

$137 million

to

$439 million

as of

December 31, 2018

compared to

December 31, 2017

.

As of December 31, 2018

,

$368 million

of the

$439 million

of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.

Under the TCJA, we have incurred a charge associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings, including foreign held cash. These funds are largely accessible, if needed in the US to fund operations. See

Senior Credit Facilities

In July 2016, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiaries entered into a new senior credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") consisting of a

$500 million

senior unsecured term loan and a

$1.0 billion

senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), each maturing in 2021. The margin for borrowings under the senior unsecured term loan and the senior unsecured revolving credit facility was

1.5%

above LIBOR at our current credit ratings. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese US and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries ("the Subsidiary Guarantors"). The proceeds from the new senior unsecured term loan and

$409 million

of borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were used to repay our Term C-2 and C-3 loans under our previous senior secured credit facilities. We borrowed

$940 million

and repaid

$997 million

under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended

December 31, 2018

. See

Note 30 - Subsequent Events

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

•

Senior Notes

We have outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), as amended, as follows (collectively, the "Senior Notes"):



The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Celanese US may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

On November 5, 2018, Celanese US completed an offering of the

2.125%

Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The

2.125%

Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The

2.125%

Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of

99.231%

. Net proceeds from the sale of the

2.125%

Notes were used to repay

$463 million

of our senior unsecured term loan and for general corporate purposes.

In December 2017, Celanese US completed an offering of the

1.250%

Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The

1.250%

Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The

1.250%

Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of

99.810%

. Net proceeds from the sale of the

1.250%

Notes were used to make a discretionary contribution into our US pension plans of $316 million and for general corporate purposes.

In September 2016, Celanese US completed an offering of the 1.125% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 1.125% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of

99.713%

. Net proceeds from the sale of the 1.125% Notes were used to repay $411 million of outstanding borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

•

Other Financing Arrangements

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a factoring agreement with a global financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized

$117 million

of accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2018.

In July 2016, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amendment of our accounts receivable securitization facility, extending its maturity to July 2019 and decreasing the available amount to $120 million. We borrowed

$25 million

and repaid

$28 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Our material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of

December 31, 2018

.

See

Note 14 - Debt

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Share Capital

On September 17, 2018, we filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment (the "Certificate of Amendment") to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to remove all references to our Series B Common Stock, par value

$0.0001

per share, therefrom and to redesignate our Series A Common Stock, par value

$0.0001

per share, as "Common Stock." Following the filing of the Certificate of Amendment, we no longer have series of our class of common stock.

On

February 6, 2019

, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.54

per share on our Common Stock amounting to

$69 million

. The cash dividend will be paid on

March 1, 2019

to holders of record as of

February 19, 2019

.

Our Board of Directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of

$3.9 billion

of our Common Stock since February 2008. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we repurchased shares of our Common Stock at an aggregate cost of

$817 million

. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$713 million

remaining under authorizations by our Board of Directors.

Contractual Debt and Cash Obligations

The following table sets forth our fixed contractual debt and cash obligations as of

December 31, 2018

:

______________________________

(1)

Future interest expense is calculated using the rate in effect on

December 31, 2018

.

(2)

Other debt is primarily made up of fixed rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, short-term borrowings from affiliated companies, our revolving credit facility, our accounts receivable securitization facility and other bank obligations.

(3)

Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities, we are unable to determine the timing of payments related to our uncertain tax obligations, including interest and penalties. These amounts are therefore reflected in "After 5 Years".

(4)

Unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent the take-or-pay provisions included in certain long-term purchase agreements. We do not expect to incur material losses under these arrangements. These amounts, obtained via a survey of Celanese, also include other purchase obligations such as maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts, software agreements and other miscellaneous agreements and contracts.

Contractual Guarantees and Commitments

As of

December 31, 2018

, we have standby letters of credit of

$29 million

and bank guarantees of $9 million outstanding, which are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements.

See

Note 14 - Debt

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.

We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results. See

Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

•

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker. Our reporting units include our engineered materials, acetate tow, food ingredients, emulsion polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.

When assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. After assessing qualitative factors, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative assessment is not required. If an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset, a quantitative analysis will be performed. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances.

In performing a quantitative analysis, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. We may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process. The valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches (market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis) and the discounted cash flow approach. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"). The WACC considers market and industry data as well as company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain long-lived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing.

Management tests other indefinite-lived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant



management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.

Valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods. We periodically engage third-party valuation consultants to assist us with this process. Specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and company-specific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant. The current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions. To the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may occur in future periods.

Note 11 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

•

Environmental Liabilities

We manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly, our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. We recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the site, we accrue through

15 years

, unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond

15 years

. We estimate environmental liabilities on a case-by-case basis using the most current status of available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation monitoring costs. These undiscounted reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance. The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on our periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort. We utilize third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for our sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur.

See

Note 16 - Environmental

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

•

Benefit Obligations

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the discount rate, compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs. In addition, actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods.

Pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Assumptions are reviewed on a plan and country-specific basis by third-party actuaries and senior management. Such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook.

Beginning in 2016, we elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, we estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.



This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost will be completely offset in the annual actuarial (gain) loss reported. We accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2016.

See

Note 15 - Benefit Obligations

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

The estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in


from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows:

Excludes nonqualified pension plans.

•

Legal Proceedings

We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business, as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including: notifications, prior settlements, demands, which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel, available facts, identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior experience. A determination of the amount of loss contingency required, if any, is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available. Due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings.

See

Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

•

Income Taxes

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed. In forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards, we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified. We attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature. Weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles. Less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature, and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide. Valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the

US, Luxembourg, Spain, China, the United Kingdom, Canada and France

. We have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.



The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment. If actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or Other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. In addition, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risks

Our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including use of derivatives. We have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices as described below.

See

Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments accounting policies related to financial market risk.

See

Note 22 - Derivative Financial Instruments

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations.

•

Foreign Currency Forwards and Swaps

A portion of our assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the US dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results. Our largest exposures are to the Euro and Chinese Yuan ("CNY"). A decline in the value of the Euro and CNY versus the US dollar results in a decline in the US dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in Euros and CNYs due to translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the Euro and CNY versus the US dollar would result in an opposite effect. We estimate that a 10% change in the Euro/US dollar and CNY/US dollar exchange rates would impact our earnings by

$70 million

and

$25 million

, respectively.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the three months ended

December 31, 2018

, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2018

December 31, 2018

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2018

, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2018

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2018

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Description of the Company and Basis of Presentation

Description of the Company

Celanese Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") is a global technology and specialty materials company. The Company produces high performance engineered polymers that are used in a variety of high-value applications, as well as acetyl products, which are intermediate chemicals for nearly all major industries. The Company also engineers and manufactures a wide variety of products essential to everyday living. The Company's broad product portfolio serves a diverse set of end-use applications including automotive, chemical additives, construction, consumer and industrial adhesives, consumer and medical, energy storage, filtration, food and beverage, paints and coatings, paper and packaging, performance industrial and textiles.

Definitions

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The term "Celanese US" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") for all periods presented and include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified, have been presented to separately show the effects of discontinued operations.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements relative to a number of topics, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, supply agreements, product sales and other arrangements. The Company endeavors to describe those contracts or agreements that are material to its business, results of operations or financial position. The Company may also describe some arrangements that are not material but in which the Company believes investors may have an interest or which may have been included in a Form 8-K filing. Investors should not assume the Company has described all contracts and agreements relative to the Company's business in this Annual Report.

For those consolidated ventures in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than

100%

of the economics, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interests.

The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts primarily due to (1) adoption of ASU 2017-07 (defined below in

Note 3

) and (2) to conform to the presentation of the Company's current reportable segments (

Note 26

).

2. Summary of Accounting Policies

Critical Accounting Policies

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets either qualitatively or quantitatively annually during the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. Impairment losses are generally recorded in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations.



Recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. In performing a quantitative analysis, the Company measures the recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. The Company may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company's theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants.

Environmental Liabilities

The Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company's operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the site, the Company accrues through

15 years

, unless the Company has government orders or other agreements that extend beyond

15 years

. The Company estimates environmental liabilities on a case-by-case basis using the most current status of available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.

An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation monitoring costs. These undiscounted reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance. The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on the Company's periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort. The Company utilizes third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for its sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur.

Pension and Other Postretirement Obligations

The Company recognizes a balance sheet asset or liability for each of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan's funded status as of a December 31 measurement date. The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the discount rate, compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs. In addition, actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation.

The Company applies the long-term expected rate of return to the fair value of plan assets and immediately recognizes in operating results the change in fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Events requiring a plan remeasurement will be recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement plan net periodic benefit costs are recorded on a quarterly basis.

The Company allocates the service cost and amortization of prior service cost (or credit) components of its pension and postretirement plans to its business segments. Interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses are considered financing activities managed at the corporate level and are recorded to Other Activities. The Company believes the expense allocation appropriately matches the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment.



Other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. The key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") are the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate.

•

Discount Rate

As of the measurement date, the Company determines the appropriate discount rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed-income securities.

In the US, the rate used to discount pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities is based on a yield curve developed from market data of over


Aa-grade non-callable bonds at the measurement date. This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

The Company determines its discount rates in the Euro zone using the iBoxx Euro Corporate AA Bond indices with appropriate adjustments for the duration of the plan obligations. In other international locations, the Company determines its discount rates based on the yields of high quality government bonds with a duration appropriate to the duration of the plan obligations.

•

Change in estimate regarding pension and other postretirement benefits

Beginning in 2016, the Company elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change did not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost was completely offset in the annual actuarial (gain) loss reported. The Company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate beginning in 2016.

•

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets

The Company determines the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation, as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested. A single long-term expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the long-term expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan.

The expected rate of return is assessed annually and is based on long-term relationships among major asset classes and the level of incremental returns that can be earned by the successful implementation of different active investment management strategies. Equity returns are based on estimates of long-term inflation rate, real rate of return,

10-year

Treasury bond premium over cash and historical equity risk premium. Fixed income returns are based on maturity, historical long-term inflation, real rate of return and credit spreads.

•

Investment Policies and Strategies

The investment objectives for the Company's pension plans are to earn, over a moving twenty-year period, a long-term expected rate of return, net of investment fees and transaction costs, sufficient to satisfy the benefit obligations of the plan, while at the same time maintaining adequate liquidity to pay benefit obligations and proper expenses, and meet any other cash needs, in the short- to medium-term.

The equity and debt securities objectives are to provide diversified exposure across the US and global equity markets and to manage the risks and returns of the plans through the use of multiple managers and strategies. The fixed income strategy is designed to reduce liability-related interest rate risk by investing in bonds that match the duration and credit quality of the plan liabilities. Derivatives-based strategies may be used to mitigate investment risks.

The financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each plan's liability structure. The Company's asset allocation policy is based on detailed asset/liability analysis. In developing investment policy and financial goals, consideration is given to each plan's demographics, the returns and risks associated with



current and alternative investment strategies and the current and projected cash, expense and funding ratios of each plan. Investment policies must also comply with local statutory requirements as determined by each country. A formal asset/liability study of each plan is undertaken every three to five years or whenever there has been a material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or funding status and investment market. The Company has adopted a long-term investment horizon such that the risk and duration of investment losses are weighed against the long-term potential for appreciation of assets. Although there cannot be complete assurance that these objectives will be realized, it is believed that the likelihood for their realization is reasonably high, based upon the asset allocation chosen and the historical and expected performance of the asset classes utilized by the plans. The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified across asset classes, investment styles, market sectors, investment managers, developed and emerging markets and securities in order to moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments may be in separate accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and other pooled asset portfolios provided they all conform to fiduciary standards.

External investment managers are hired to manage pension assets. Investment consultants assist with the screening process for each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the investment portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a composite of market indices that are weighted to match each plan's target asset allocation. The portfolio return should also (over the long-term) meet or exceed the return used for actuarial calculations in order to meet the future needs of each plan.

Legal Proceedings

Due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, the Company's litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss ("Possible Loss") may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from legal proceedings. For reasonably possible loss contingencies that may be material, the Company estimates its Possible Loss when determinable, considering that the Company could incur no loss in certain matters.

For some matters, the Company is unable, at this time, to estimate its Possible Loss that is reasonably possible of occurring. Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the more difficult it is for the Company to estimate the Possible Loss that is reasonably possible the Company could incur. The Company may disclose certain information related to a plaintiff's claim against the Company alleged in the plaintiff's pleadings or otherwise publicly available. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent the Company's estimate of reasonably possible or probable loss. Some of the Company's exposure in legal matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. The Company does not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals or any estimates of Possible Loss. Thus, the Company's exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly materially so, than the Company's litigation accruals and estimates of Possible Loss.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date.

The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical merits, that the positions will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax (provision) benefit in the consolidated statements of operations.



Other Accounting Policies

Consolidation Principles

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for all periods presented and include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations, environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Purchase Accounting

The Company recognizes the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are valued using the relief from royalty, multi-period excess earnings and discounted cash flow methodologies, which are considered Level 3 measurements. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company's theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this method include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Key assumptions used in the multi-period excess earnings method include discount rates, retention rates, growth rates, sales projections, expense projections and contributory asset charges. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. All of these methodologies require significant management judgment and, therefore, are susceptible to change. The Company calculates the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to allocate the purchase price at the acquisition date. The Company may use the assistance of third-party valuation consultants.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Market participant assumptions are categorized by a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. Valuations for fund investments, such as common/collective trusts, registered investment companies and short-term investment funds, which do not have readily determinable fair values, are typically estimated using a net asset value provided by a third party as a practical expedient.

The levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company

Level 2 - inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1

Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation



Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write-offs having a material impact on financial results is low. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated using factors such as customer credit ratings, past collection history and general risk profile. Receivables are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.

Inventories

Inventories, including stores and supplies, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost for inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Cost includes raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost for stores and supplies is primarily determined by the average cost method.

Investments

•

Marketable Securities

The cost of available-for-sale securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.

•

Investments in Affiliates

Investments in equity securities where the Company can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of an investee, which is generally considered when an investor owns 20% or more of the voting stock of an investee, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments in equity securities where the Company does not exercise significant influence are accounted for at fair value or, if such investments do not have a readily determinable fair value, an election may be made to measure them at cost after considering observable price changes for similar instruments, minus impairment, if any. The Company determined it cannot exercise significant influence over certain investments where the Company owns greater than a 20% interest due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on the Company's involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Further, these investments were determined not to have a readily determinable fair value. Accordingly, these investments are accounted for using the alternative measure described above.

In certain instances, the financial information of the Company's equity investees is not available on a timely basis. Accordingly, the Company records its proportional share of the investee's earnings or losses on a consistent lag of no more than

one quarter

.

When required to assess the recoverability of its investments in affiliates, the Company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The Company may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings, machinery and equipment, including capitalized interest, and property under capital lease agreements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company records depreciation and amortization in its consolidated statements of operations as either Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses consistent with the utilization of the underlying assets. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of depreciable assets:

Leasehold improvements are amortized over

10 years

or the remaining life of the respective lease, whichever is shorter.

Accelerated depreciation is recorded when the estimated useful life is shortened. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs, including costs for planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not extend the useful life of the asset are charged to earnings as



incurred. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and depreciation accounts until sold or otherwise disposed. In the case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in earnings.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be assessed when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. The Company calculates the fair value using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for the asset group, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections involve significant judgment and are based on management's estimate of current and forecasted market conditions and cost structure. Impairment losses are generally recorded in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Definite-lived Intangible Assets

Customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from

three

to

30 years

.

Derivative and Hedging Instruments

The Company manages its exposures to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The fair value of derivative instruments other than foreign currency forwards and swaps is recorded as an asset or liability on a net basis at the balance sheet date.

•

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap to mitigate the risk of variability in the benchmark interest rate for an expected debt issuance in 2021. The interest rate swap agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, to the extent the cash flow hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are included in gain (loss) from cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the interest rate swap is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the interest rate swap expires or the cash flow hedge is dedesignated because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur according to the original strategy.

•

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

Certain subsidiaries of the Company have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies, which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company also is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on transactions with third-party entities as well as intercompany transactions. The Company minimizes its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forwards and swaps. These foreign currency forwards and swaps are not designated as hedges. Gains and losses on foreign currency forwards and swaps entered into to offset foreign exchange impacts on intercompany balances are included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on foreign currency forwards and swaps entered into to offset foreign exchange impacts on all other assets and liabilities are included in Foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company uses non-derivative financial instruments that may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains or losses to hedge the foreign currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses from remeasurement of the non-derivative financial instrument is included in foreign currency translation within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged investment is sold or liquidated.

•

Commodity Risk Management

The Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its procurement of certain raw materials. The Company manages its exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts. The Company regularly assesses its practice of using forward purchase contracts



and other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with changes in economic conditions. Forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through physical delivery of the commodity. For qualifying contracts, the Company has elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception based on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that the Company would not net settle and the transaction would result in the physical delivery of the commodity. Accordingly, realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract.

The Company also uses commodity swaps to hedge the risk of fluctuating price changes in certain raw materials and in which physical settlement does not occur. These commodity swaps fix the variable fee component of the price of certain commodities. All or a portion of these commodity swap agreements may be designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, to the extent the cash flow hedge was effective, changes in the fair value of commodity swaps are included in gain (loss) from cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the period that the hedged item affected earnings.

Insurance Loss Reserves

The Company has

two

wholly-owned insurance companies (the "Captives") that are used as a form of self-insurance for liability and workers compensation risks. Capitalization of the Captives is determined by regulatory guidelines. Premiums written are recognized as revenue based on policy periods. One of the Captives also insures certain third-party risks. The Captives use reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risks, however these arrangements do not relieve the Captives from their obligations to policyholders. The financial condition of the Captives' reinsurers are monitored to minimize exposure to insolvencies. However, failure of the reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Captives.

Claim reserves are established when sufficient information is available to indicate a specific policy is involved and the Company can reasonably estimate its liability. These reserves are based on management estimates and periodic actuarial valuations. In addition, reserves have been established to cover exposures for both known and unreported claims. Estimates of these liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly, however it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Periodically, the Company will conclude a site no longer has an indeterminate life based on long-lived asset impairment triggering events and decisions made by the Company. Accordingly, the Company will record asset retirement obligations associated with such sites. To measure the fair value of the asset retirement obligations, the Company will use the expected present value technique, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The expected present value technique uses a set of cash flows that represent the probability-weighted average of all possible cash flows based on the Company's judgment. The Company uses the following inputs to determine the fair value of the asset retirement obligations based on the Company's experience with fulfilling obligations of this type and the Company's knowledge of market conditions: (a) labor costs; (b) allocation of overhead costs; (c) profit on labor and overhead costs; (d) effect of inflation on estimated costs and profits; (e) risk premium for bearing the uncertainty inherent in cash flows, other than inflation; (f) time value of money represented by the risk-free interest rate commensurate with the timing of the associated cash flows; and (g) nonperformance risk relating to the liability, which includes the Company's own credit risk. The asset retirement obligations are accreted to their undiscounted values until the time at which they are expected to be settled.

The Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to certain of its existing operating facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities indefinitely and therefore, a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites, an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time. If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows.



Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized using a method that approximates the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt into Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon the extinguishment of the related debt, any unamortized deferred financing costs are immediately expensed and included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon the modification of the related debt, a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs may be immediately expensed and included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Direct costs of refinancing activities are immediately expensed and included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. The majority of the Company's contracts have a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products and is generally based upon a negotiated, formula, list or fixed price. The Company sells its products both directly to customers and through distributors generally under agreements with payment terms typically less than 90 days.

The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good. As such, shipping and handling fees billed to customers in a sales transaction are recorded in Net sales and shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded in Cost of sales. The Company has elected to exclude from Net sales any value add, sales and other taxes which it collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities. These accounting policy elections are consistent with the manner in which the Company historically recorded shipping and handling fees and taxes.

•

Contract Estimates

The nature of certain of the Company's contracts gives rise to variable consideration, which may be constrained, including retrospective volume-based rebates to certain customers. The Company issues retrospective volume-based rebates to customers when they purchase a certain volume level, and the rebates are applied retroactively to prior purchases. The Company also issues prospective volume-based rebates to customers when they purchase a certain volume level, and the rebates are applied to future purchases. Prospective volume-based rebates represent a material right within the contract and therefore are considered to be separate performance obligations. For both retrospective and prospective volume-based rebates, the Company estimates the level of volumes based on anticipated purchases at the beginning of the period and records a rebate accrual for each purchase toward the requisite rebate volume. These estimated rebates are included in the transaction price of the Company's contracts with customers as a reduction to Net sales and are included in Current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (

Note 12

). This methodology is consistent with the manner in which the Company historically estimated and recorded volume-based rebates.

The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which it recognizes revenue at the amount in which it has the right to invoice as product is delivered. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to disclose the value of remaining performance obligations associated with these types of contracts. However, the Company has certain contracts that represent take-or-pay revenue arrangements in which the Company's performance obligations extend over multiple years.

As of December 31, 2018

, the Company had

$791 million

of remaining performance obligations related to take-or-pay contracts. The Company expects to recognize approximately

$204 million

of its remaining performance obligations as Net sales in 2019,

$239 million

in 2020, an additional

$148 million

in 2021 and the balance thereafter.

The Company has certain contracts which contain performance obligations which are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to assess whether these promised goods or services are performance obligations.

•

Contract Balances

Contract liabilities primarily relate to advances or deposits received from the Company's customers before revenue is recognized. These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in Noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (

Note 13

).

The Company does not have any material contract assets as of

December 31, 2018

.



Research and Development

The costs of research and development are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Management Compensation Plans

Share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized over the participant's requisite service period. Upon termination of a participant's employment with the Company by reason of death or disability, retirement or by the Company without cause (as defined in the respective award agreements), a prorated award will generally vest on the original vesting date. The prorated award is calculated based on the time lapsed between the grant date and the date of termination, reduced by awards previously vested. Upon the termination of a Participant's employment with the Company for any other reason, any unvested portion of the award shall be forfeited and canceled without consideration.

•

Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

Performance-based RSUs.

The Company generally grants performance-based RSUs to the Company's executive officers and certain employees annually in February. The Company may also grant performance-based RSUs to certain new employees or to employees who assume positions of increasing responsibility at the time those events occur. The fair value of the Company's performance-based RSUs with a performance condition is equal to the average of the high and low price of the Company's common stock, par value

$0.0001

per share ("Common Stock"), on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Outstanding performance-based RSUs generally cliff-vest

three years

from the date of grant. Compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the vesting period of the respective grant on a straight-line basis. Historically, the Company recognized share-based compensation net of estimated forfeitures over the vesting period of the respective grant. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company elected to change its accounting policy to recognize forfeitures as they occur. The new forfeiture policy election was adopted using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment of

$1 million

to Retained earnings as of January 1, 2017.

The number of performance-based RSUs that ultimately vest is dependent on one or both of the following according to the terms of the specific award agreement: the achievement of (a) internal profitability targets (performance condition) and (b) market performance targets measured by the comparison of the Company's stock performance versus a defined peer group (market condition). Based on the achievement of internal profitability targets, the ultimate number of shares of the Company's Common Stock issued will range from

zero to stretch

, with stretch defined individually under each award, net of shares used to cover minimum statutory personal income taxes withheld. Performance-based RSUs are canceled to the extent actual results do not meet minimum internal profitability measures, as defined individually under each award.

Time-based RSUs.

The Company grants non-employee Directors time-based RSUs annually that generally vest

one year

from the grant date. The Company also grants time-based RSUs to the Company's executives and certain employees that generally vest ratably over

three years

. The fair value of the time-based RSUs is equal to the average of the high and low price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Compensation expense for time-based RSUs is recognized over the vesting period of the respective grant on a straight-line basis.

The Company's RSUs are net settled by withholding shares of the Company's Common Stock to cover minimum statutory income taxes and remitting the remaining shares of the Company's Common Stock to an individual brokerage account. Authorized shares of the Company's Common Stock are used to settle RSUs.

Under the 2018 Global Incentive Plan ("2018 GIP"), the Company may not grant RSUs with the right to participate in dividends or dividend equivalents prior to vesting.

Functional and Reporting Currencies

For the Company's international operations where the functional currency is other than the US dollar, assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates, while the statement of operations amounts are translated using the average exchange rates for the respective period. Differences arising from the translation of assets and liabilities in comparison with the translation of the previous periods or from initial recognition during the period are included as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.



3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standard Updates ("ASU") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"):



Adoption of ASU 2017-07

ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to report the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of Operating profit (loss). The new guidance represents a change in accounting principle. The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective transition method. The adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a change in certain previously reported amounts, as follows:



4. Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures

Acquisitions

•

Omni Plastics

On February 1, 2018, using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the Company acquired

100%

of the ownership interests of Omni Plastics, L.L.C. and its subsidiaries ("Omni Plastics"). Omni Plastics specializes in custom compounding of various engineered thermoplastic materials. The acquisition further strengthens the Company's global asset base by adding compounding capacity in the Americas. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the acquired operations are included in the Engineered Materials segment.

Pro forma financial information since the respective acquisition date has not been provided as the acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company's financial information. The Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. The Company calculated the fair value of the assets acquired using the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof). Fair values of certain assets were determined based on Level 3 inputs

including estimated future cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections, retention rates and terminal values, all of which require significant management judgment and are susceptible to change. The purchase price allocation was based upon preliminary information and is subject to change if additional information about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. The final fair value of the net assets acquired may result in adjustments to the assets and liabilities, including goodwill. However, any subsequent measurement period adjustments are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.

The preliminary purchase price allocation for the Omni Plastics acquisition is as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Goodwill consists of expected revenue and operating synergies resulting from the acquisition, all of which is deductible for income tax purposes.

The amount of pro forma Net earnings (loss) of Omni Plastics included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations was less than

1%

(unaudited) of its consolidated Net earnings (loss) had the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of 2018. The amount of Omni Plastics' Net earnings (loss) consolidated by the Company since the acquisition date was not material.



•

Acetate Tow Joint Venture

In June 2017, Celanese, through various subsidiaries, entered into an agreement with affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the "Blackstone Entities") to form a joint venture which would combine substantially all of the operations of the Company's Acetate Tow business and the operations of the Rhodia Acetow cellulose acetate business formerly operated by Solvay S.A. and acquired by the Blackstone Entities in June 2017. The parties were subsequently unable to reach an agreement with the European Commission on acceptable conditions to allow the proposed joint venture to proceed. The demands by the European Commission eliminated the primary advantages of the transaction. As a result, on March 19, 2018, the Company and the Blackstone Entities abandoned their agreement to form the proposed joint venture.

•

Nilit Plastics

In May 2017, using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the Company acquired the nylon compounding division of Nilit Group ("Nilit"), an independent producer of high performance nylon resins, fibers and compounds. Celanese acquired the nylon compounding product portfolio, customer agreements and manufacturing, technology and commercial facilities. The acquisition of Nilit increases the Company's global engineered materials product platforms, extends the operational model, technical and industry solutions capabilities and expands project pipelines. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the acquired operations are included in the Engineered Materials segment. The Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation was based on preliminary information. During the measurement period, the Company made certain adjustments to its purchase price allocation to adjust taxes and working capital, which resulted in a

$2 million

reduction to goodwill initially recorded.

Plant Closures

•

Ocotlán, Mexico

On June 6, 2018, the Company announced the consolidation of its global acetate manufacturing operations by initiating the closure of its acetate tow manufacturing unit in Ocotlán, Mexico. The acetate flake unit will remain operational and is unaffected by these actions. The Ocotlán, Mexico operations are included in the Company's Acetate Tow segment.

The exit and shutdown costs related to this closure are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Included in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statement of operations (

Note 18

).

The Company does not expect to incur significant exit and shutdown costs in 2019.

5. Ventures and Variable Interest Entities

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company has a joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC ("Fairway"), with Mitsui & Co., Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan ("Mitsui"), in which the Company owns

50%

of Fairway, for the production of methanol at the Company's integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. The methanol unit utilizes natural gas in the US Gulf Coast region as a feedstock and benefits from the existing infrastructure at the Company's Clear Lake facility. Both Mitsui and the Company supply their own natural gas to Fairway in exchange for methanol tolling under a cost-plus off-take arrangement.

The Company determined that Fairway is a variable interest entity ("VIE") in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Under the terms of the joint venture agreements, the Company provides site services and day-to-day operations for the



methanol facility. In addition, the joint venture agreements provide that the Company indemnifies Mitsui for environmental obligations that exceed a specified threshold, as well as an equity option between the partners. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the venture and records a noncontrolling interest for the share of the venture owned by Mitsui. Fairway is included in the Company's Acetyl Chain segment.

The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities associated with Fairway included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Assets can only be used to settle the obligations of Fairway.

(2)

Primarily represents amounts owed by Fairway to the Company for reimbursement of expenditures.

Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company holds variable interests in entities that supply certain raw materials and services to the Company. The variable interests primarily relate to cost-plus contractual arrangements with the suppliers and recovery of capital expenditures for certain plant assets plus a rate of return on such assets. Liabilities for such supplier recoveries of capital expenditures have been recorded as capital lease obligations. The entities are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entities as it does not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these VIEs as of

December 31, 2018

relates primarily to the recovery of capital expenditures for certain property, plant and equipment.

The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities associated with the obligations to nonconsolidated VIEs, as well as the maximum exposure to loss relating to these nonconsolidated VIEs are as follows:



The difference between the total liabilities associated with obligations to unconsolidated VIEs and the maximum exposure to loss primarily represents take-or-pay obligations for services included in the Company's unconditional purchase obligations (

Note 24

).

6. Marketable Securities, at Fair Value

The Company's nonqualified trusts hold available-for-sale securities for funding requirements of the Company's nonqualified pension plans (

Note 15

) as follows:

7. Receivables, Net

8. Inventories

9. Investments in Affiliates

Entities in which the Company has an investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting or equity investments without readily determinable fair values are considered affiliates; any transactions or balances with such companies are considered affiliate transactions.



Equity Method

Equity method investments and ownership interests by business segment are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

InfraServ GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG is owned primarily by an entity included in the Company's Engineered Materials segment. Prior to 2017, InfraServ GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG was owned primarily by an entity included in the Company's Other Activities segment. The Company's Acetyl Chain segment also holds an ownership percentage.

(2)

The Company accounts for its ownership interest in Sherbrooke Capital Health and Wellness, L.P. under the equity method of accounting because the Company is able to exercise significant influence.

(3)

InfraServ real estate service companies ("InfraServ Entities") own and operate sites in Frankfurt am Main-Hoechst, Gendorf and Knapsack, Germany. The InfraServ Entities were created to own land and property and to provide various technical and administrative services at these manufacturing locations.

In connection with the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company did not record an impairment loss to goodwill during the nine months ended September 30,


as the estimated fair value for each of the Company's reporting units exceeded the carrying amount of the underlying assets by a substantial margin (

Note 2

). No events or changes in circumstances occurred during the three months ended

December 31, 2018

that would indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Accordingly, no additional impairment analysis was performed during that period.

Senior Credit Facilities

In July 2016, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiaries entered into a new senior credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") consisting of a

$500 million

senior unsecured term loan and a

$1.0 billion

senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), each maturing in 2021. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese US and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries ("the Subsidiary Guarantors").

See

Note 30

for further information.

Senior Notes

The Company has outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), as amended (collectively, the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Celanese US may redeem some or all of



each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of

100%

of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

On November 5, 2018, Celanese US completed an offering of

€500 million

in principal amount of

2.125%

senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2027 (the "

2.125%

Notes") in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The

2.125%

Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The

2.125%

Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of

99.231%

, which is being amortized to Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the

2.125%

Notes. Net proceeds from the sale of the

2.125%

Notes were used to repay

$463 million

of the senior unsecured term loan and for general corporate purposes.

In December 2017, Celanese US completed an offering of

€300 million

in principal amount of

1.250%

senior unsecured notes due February 11, 2025 (the "

1.250%

Notes") in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The

1.250%

Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The

1.250%

Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of

99.810%

, which is being amortized to Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the

1.250%

Notes.

In September 2016, Celanese US completed an offering of

€750 million

in principal amount of 1.125% senior unsecured notes due September 26, 2023 (the "1.125% Notes") in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 1.125% Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The 1.125% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of

99.713%

, which is being amortized to Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the 1.125% Notes. Net proceeds from the sale of the 1.125% Notes were used to repay

$411 million

of outstanding borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility

The Company has a US accounts receivable securitization facility involving receivables of certain of its domestic subsidiaries of the Company transferred to a wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary of the Company ("SPE"). The securitization facility, which permits cash borrowings and letters of credit, expires in July 2019. All of the SPE's assets have been pledged to the administrative agent in support of the SPE's obligations under the facility.

The Company's debt balances and amounts available for borrowing under its securitization facility are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

The Company borrowed

$25 million

and repaid

$28 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

(2)

Outstanding accounts receivable transferred to the SPE was

$185 million

.

Other Financing Arrangements

On June 25, 2018, the Company entered into a factoring agreement with a global financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. The Company has no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Company de-recognized

$117 million

of accounts receivable during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.



Principal payments scheduled to be made on the Company's debt, including short-term borrowings, are as follows:

The Company's material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants related to its debt agreements as of

December 31, 2018

.



15. Benefit Obligations

Pension Obligations

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North America, Europe and Asia. Independent trusts or insurance companies administer the majority of these plans. Pension obligations are established for benefits payable in the form of retirement, disability and surviving dependent pensions. The commitments result from participation in defined contribution and defined benefit plans, primarily in the US. Benefits are dependent on years of service and the employee's compensation. Supplemental retirement benefits provided to certain employees are nonqualified for US tax purposes. Separate nonqualified trusts have been established for certain US nonqualified plan obligations. Pension costs under the Company's retirement plans are actuarially determined.

In October 2014, the Company offered a limited-time, voluntary program to certain participants of the Company's US qualified defined benefit pension plan with a vested benefit who terminated from the Company on or before May 31, 2014. The limited-time opportunity ended in November 2014 and included an offer of a single lump sum payment in December 2014 or to begin monthly annuity payments, regardless of age, or to continue to defer benefits until retirement age. If an election was not made by the eligible participant, the participant will begin receiving payments when otherwise eligible under the terms of the US qualified defined benefit pension plan.

Effective June 2014, the Company's US qualified defined benefit plan was amended and benefits offered to all current union participants of the Cash Balance Plan (hired on or after January 1, 2001) at the Company's Narrows, Virginia facility have been frozen and the US qualified defined benefit plan was closed to future union participants at the facility. Accumulated benefits earned and service rendered through May 2014 under the Plan provisions for the Cash Balance Plan Participants will continue to be considered for purposes of determining retirement benefits. Effective May 2014, the Company's US qualified defined benefit plan was amended and benefits offered to all current union participants of the Flat Rate Plan at the Company's Narrows, Virginia facility have been frozen and the US qualified defined benefit plan was closed to future union participants at the facility. Accumulated benefits earned and service rendered through December 2014 under the Plan provisions for the Flat Rate Plan Participants will continue to be considered for purposes of determining retirement benefits and eligibility for early retirement. These actions did not result in a curtailment gain or loss as the projected benefit obligation does not rely on salary assumptions.

Effective December 2013, benefits offered to all US non-union eligible employees in the Company's US qualified defined benefit pension plan have been frozen and the US qualified defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants. Accumulated benefits earned and service rendered through December 31, 2013 under the US qualified defined benefit pension plan provisions will continue to be considered for purposes of determining retirement benefits and eligibility for early retirement.

The Company participates in a multiemployer defined benefit plan and a multiemployer defined contribution plan in Germany covering certain employees. The Company's contributions to the multiemployer defined benefit plan are based on specified percentages of employee contributions as outlined in a works council agreement, covering all German entity employees hired prior to January 1, 2012. As of January 1, 2012, the multiemployer defined benefit pension plan described above was closed to new employees. Qualifying employees hired in Germany after December 31, 2011 are covered by a multiemployer defined contribution plan. The Company's contributions to the multiemployer defined contribution plan are based on specified percentages of employee contributions, similar to the multiemployer defined benefit plan, but at a lower rate.

Statutory regulations and the works council agreement require the contributions to fully fund the multiemployer plans. The risks of participating in the multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:

•

Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.

•

If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, any underfunding may be borne by the remaining participants, especially since regulations strictly enforce funding requirements.

•

If the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, the Company may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as the withdrawal liability.



Based on the


unaudited and


audited multiemployer defined benefit plan's financial statements, the plan is 100% funded in


,


and


. The number of employees covered by the Company's multiemployer defined benefit plan remained relatively stable year over year from


to


, resulting in minimal changes to employer contributions. Participation in the German multiemployer defined benefit plan is not considered individually significant to the Company.

Contributions made by the Company to the German multiemployer plan are as follows:

Other Postretirement Obligations

Certain retired employees receive postretirement health care and life insurance benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which has the right to modify or terminate these plans at any time. The cost for coverage is shared between the Company and the retiree. The cost of providing retiree health care and life insurance benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee group. The Company's policy is to fund benefits as claims and premiums are paid. The US postretirement health care plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2006.

Postemployment Obligations

The Company provides benefits to certain employees after employment but prior to retirement, including severance and disability-related benefits offered pursuant to ongoing benefit arrangements. The cost of providing postemployment benefits is actuarially determined and recorded when the obligation is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated.

Postemployment obligations are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North America, Europe and Asia covering certain employees. Employees may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these contributions in varying amounts. The Company's matching contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on specified percentages of employee contributions.

Beginning in 2014, the Company took the following actions as it relates to the US defined contribution plan:

•

Increased its employer match for those employees participating in the US defined contribution plan;

•

Added an annual retirement contribution for US employees who are employed as of December 31st each year (or have died during that year), regardless of whether the employee contributes to the US defined contribution plan; and

•

For certain eligible US employees, provides an incremental retirement contribution through 2017, based on years of service and specified percentages of eligible compensation.

The amount of costs recognized for the Company's defined contribution plans are as follows:

The Company's defined benefit plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (

Note 2

) as follows:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Foreign and domestic currencies as well as short term securities are valued at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.

Equity securities, treasuries and corporate debt:

Valued at the closing price reported on the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Automated quotes are provided by multiple pricing services and validated by the plan custodian. These securities are traded on exchanges as well as in the over the counter market.

Registered Investment Companies:

Composed of various mutual funds and other investment companies whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic equities, fixed income securities, and short-term investments. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end.

Common/Collective Trusts:

Composed of various funds whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic equities, fixed income securities, and short-term investments. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end.



Derivatives:

Derivative financial instruments are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and swaps, and options are observable in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.

Mortgage backed securities:

Fair value is estimated based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing services for identical or comparable assets. Mortgage Backed Securities are traded in the over the counter broker/dealer market.

Insurance contracts:

Valued at contributions made, plus earnings, less participant withdrawals and administrative expenses, which approximates fair value.

Short-term investment funds:

Composed of various funds whose portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic currencies as well as short-term securities. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end.

Other:

Composed of real estate investment trust common stock valued at closing price as reported on the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

16. Environmental

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations worldwide that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and impose record keeping and notification requirements. Failure to timely comply with these laws and regulations may expose the Company to penalties. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and engages in an ongoing process of updating its controls to mitigate compliance risks. The Company is also subject to retained environmental obligations specified in various contractual agreements arising from the divestiture of certain businesses by the Company or one of its predecessor companies.

The components of environmental remediation reserves are as follows:



Remediation

Due to its industrial history and through retained contractual and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on divested, demerger, orphan or US Superfund sites (as defined below). In addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the Company and Hoechst AG ("Hoechst"), a specified portion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Company (

Note 24

). Certain of these sites, at which the Company maintains continuing involvement, were and continue to be designated as discontinued operations when closed. The Company provides for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company believes that environmental remediation costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given period.

The Company did not record any insurance recoveries during


or have any receivables for insurance recoveries related to these matters as of

December 31, 2018

. As of

December 31, 2018

and


, there were receivables of

$3 million

and

$3 million

, respectively, from the former owner of the Company's Spondon, Derby, United Kingdom acetate flake, tow and film business, which was acquired in 2007.

German InfraServ Entities

The Company's InfraServ Entities (

Note 9

) are liable for any residual contamination and other pollution because they own the real estate on which the individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, and its legal successors, as the responsible party under German public law, is liable to third parties for all environmental damage that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and real estate (

Note 24

). The contribution agreements entered into in 1997 between Hoechst and the respective operating companies, as part of the divestiture of these companies, provide that the operating companies will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against environmental liabilities resulting from the transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServ Entities have agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against any environmental liability arising out of or in connection with environmental pollution of any site.

The InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the InfraServ partnership. Also, under lease agreements entered into by an InfraServ partner as landlord, the tenants agreed to pay certain remediation costs on a pro rata basis.

If an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination, the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are not satisfied by either the InfraServ Entities or their owners, these liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst, and its legal successors, will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any such costs. Likewise, in certain circumstances the Company could be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on several sites that were not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst, and its legal successors, must also reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred.

The Company's ownership interest and environmental liability participation percentages for such liabilities, which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Gross reserves maintained by the respective InfraServ entity.



US Superfund Sites

In the US, the Company may be subject to substantial claims brought by US federal or state regulatory agencies or private individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In particular, the Company has a potential liability under the US Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws (collectively referred to as "Superfund") for investigation and cleanup costs at certain sites. At most of these sites, numerous companies, including the Company, or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the US Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), state governing bodies or private individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible parties ("PRP") under Superfund or related laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites, and the status of the insurance coverage for some of these proceedings is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot accurately determine its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs at these sites.

As events progress at each site for which it has been named a PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these liabilities, the Company considers the contaminants of concern, the potential impact thereof, the relationship of the contaminants of concern to its current and historic operations, its shipment of waste to a site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company joins with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that settle, among PRPs, each party's percentage allocation of costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most current information available.

One such site is the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which is comprised of a number of sub-sites, including the Lower Passaic River Study Area ("LPRSA"), which is the lower 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River ("Lower Passaic River Site"), and the Newark Bay Area. The Company and


other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") at the Lower Passaic River Site in order to identify the levels of contaminants and potential cleanup actions, including the potential migration of contaminants between the Lower Passaic River Site and the Newark Bay Area. Work on the RI/FS is ongoing.

In March 2016, the EPA issued its final Record of Decision concerning the remediation of the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River Site ("Lower 8.3 Miles"). Pursuant to the EPA's Record of Decision, the Lower 8.3 Miles must be dredged bank to bank and an engineered cap must be installed at an EPA estimated cost of approximately

$1.4 billion

. The Company owned and/or operated facilities in the vicinity of the Lower 8.3 Miles, but has found no evidence that it contributed any of the contaminants of concern to the Passaic River. On June 30, 2018, Occidental Chemical Corporation ("OCC"), the successor to the Diamond Alkali Company, sued a subsidiary of the Company and 119 other parties alleging claims for joint and several damages, contribution and declaratory relief under Section 107 and 113 of Superfund for costs to clean up the LPRSA portion of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site,

Occidental Chemical Corporation v. 21st Century Fox America, Inc., et al

, No. 2:18-CV-11273-JLL-JAD (U.S. District Court New Jersey), alleging that each of the defendants owned or operated a facility that contributed contamination to the LPRSA. With respect to the Company, the OCC lawsuit is limited to the former Celanese facility that Essex County, New Jersey has agreed to indemnify the Company for and does not change the Company's estimated liability for LPRSA cleanup costs. The Company is vigorously defending these matters and currently believes that its ultimate allocable share of the cleanup costs with respect to the Lower Passaic River Site, estimated at less than

1%

, will not be material to the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

17. Stockholders' Equity

Common Stock

On September 17, 2018, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment (the "Certificate of Amendment") to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to remove all references to the Company's Series B Common Stock, par value

$0.0001

per share, therefrom and to redesignate the Company's Series A Common Stock, par value

$0.0001

per share, as "Common Stock." Following the filing of the Certificate of Amendment, the Company no longer has series of its class of common stock.

The Company's Board of Directors follows a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company's Common Stock, unless the Company's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. The amount available to the Company to pay cash dividends is not currently restricted by its existing senior credit facility and its indentures governing its senior unsecured notes. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be



made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Company's Board of Directors may deem relevant.

The Company's Board of Directors approved increases in the Company's Common Stock cash dividend rates as follows:

On

February 6, 2019

, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.54

per share on its Common Stock amounting to

$69 million

. The cash dividend will be paid on

March 1, 2019

to holders of record as of

February 19, 2019

.

Treasury Stock

The Company's Board of Directors authorizes repurchases of Common Stock from time to time. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

The share repurchase activity pursuant to this authorization is as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Excludes

1,700

common shares reacquired pursuant to an employee clawback agreement.

(2)

These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program began in February 2008 and does not have an expiration date.

The purchase of treasury stock reduces the number of shares outstanding. The repurchased shares may be used by the Company for compensation programs utilizing the Company's stock and other corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders' equity.



Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net

Adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, are as follows:



18. Other (Charges) Gains, Net


During the

year ended

December 31, 2018

, the Company recorded a

$13 million

gain within plant/office closures related to a non-income tax receivable refund from Nanjing, China, in its Acetyl Chain segment.

During the

year ended

December 31, 2018

, the Company recorded

$4 million

of employee termination benefits primarily related to the Company's ongoing efforts to align its businesses around its core value drivers.


During the

year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company recorded

$3 million

of employee termination benefits primarily related to the Company's ongoing efforts to align its businesses around its core value drivers.

A partner in the Company's InfraServ equity affiliate investments exercised an option right to purchase additional ownership interests in the InfraServ entities from the Company. The purchase of these interests reduced the Company's ownership interests in InfraServ GmbH & Co. Gendorf KG and InfraServ GmbH & Co. Knapsack KG from

39%

and

27%

, to

30%

and

22%

, respectively. Accordingly, during the

year ended

December 31, 2017, the Company reduced the carrying value of these investments by

$4 million

. These InfraServ investments are primarily owned by entities included in the Other Activities segment.

During the

year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company provided notice of termination of a contract with a key raw materials supplier at its ethanol production unit in Nanjing, China. As a result, the Company recorded

$52 million

of plant/office closure costs primarily consisting of a

$22 million

contract termination charge and a

$21 million

reduction to its non-income tax receivable. The Nanjing, China ethanol production unit is included in the Company's Acetyl Chain segment.


During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded

$8 million

of employee termination benefits primarily related to the Company's ongoing efforts to align its businesses around its core value drivers.



The changes in the restructuring reserves by business segment are as follows:

19. Income Taxes

On December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted and was effective January 1, 2018. In accordance with ASC 740,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, which requires companies to recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment. This overhaul of the US tax law made a number of substantial changes, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, establishing a dividends received deduction for dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the US, elimination or limitation of certain deductions (interest, domestic production activities and executive compensation), imposing a mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 and establishing global minimum income tax and base erosion tax provisions related to offshore activities and affiliated party payments.

The deemed repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings, of which the Company had accumulated approximately

$3.0 billion

as of December 31, 2017, was taxed at

8%

to the extent those earnings were reinvested in non-cash foreign assets, while previously unremitted earnings that had not been reinvested, computed based upon a two-year historical average of foreign cash and cash equivalents balances, was taxed at

15.5%

. The Company recorded a net charge of

$197 million

for this deemed repatriation in 2017, for which it does not expect a material cash outlay due to available foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The Company was also required to adjust the recorded amounts of its US deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the US corporate tax rate and the impact of the dividends received deduction provisions on its deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences in certain joint venture investments. As a result of these changes, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately

$107 million

in 2017.



The global minimum income tax and base erosion provisions were effective for taxable years beginning after

December 31, 2017

. The Company has elected to not record deferred taxes related to the future tax effects expected from the global minimum income tax.

The US Treasury issued several proposed regulations supplementing the TCJA in 2018, including detailed guidance clarifying the calculation of the mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings, application of the existing foreign tax credit rules to newly created categories and expanding details for application of the base erosion tax on affiliate payments. These proposed regulations are intended to be applied retroactively and would not materially impact the Company's 2018 tax rate if finalized in current form. The Company currently does not expect these regulations to have a material impact on income tax expense upon final adoption.

The US Treasury's proposed 2018 regulations also seek to clarify the application of the TCJA provisions for the limitation of interest expense, including treatment of depreciation and other deductions in arriving at adjusted taxable income and application of the rules to controlled foreign affiliates. These regulations remain open for comment and are not effective until published in the federal register. As a result, the Company will monitor their impact to the Company's filing positions and will record the impacts as discrete income tax expense adjustments in the period that the guidance is finalized.

Due to the timing and significance of the TCJA, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which provided registrants a measurement period through 2018 to report the impact of the new US tax law. In 2017, the Company previously recorded provisional amounts for several of the impacts of the new tax law including: the deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits, the deferred tax rate change effect of the new law, gross foreign tax credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances offsetting foreign tax credit carryforwards. In 2018, the Company recorded additional income tax expense resulting from a decrease in SAB 118 provisional estimates of foreign tax credits (net of associated valuation allowances) of

$66 million

and an income tax benefit of

$7 million

that resulted from adjusting provisional estimates of the deferred tax rate change effects of the TCJA. The Company also recorded a decrease to the SAB 118 provisional estimates of deemed repatriation tax under the new law of

$59 million

, which was entirely offset by US foreign tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has completed its accounting for the TCJA, including the proposed 2018 clarifying guidance.

Income Tax Provision

Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before tax by jurisdiction are as follows:

The income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:



A reconciliation of the significant differences between the US federal statutory tax rate of

21%

(

35%

for 2017 and 2016) and the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations is as follows:

As a result of the TCJA, US federal and state income taxes have been recorded on undistributed foreign earnings accumulated from 1986 through December 31, 2017. Based on the provisions of the law, the Company's previously taxed income for its foreign subsidiaries significantly exceeds its offshore cash balances. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax that would be due when cash is actually repatriated to the US because those foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the business or may be remitted substantially free of any additional local taxes. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The effective tax rate for the

year ended

December 31, 2018

was comparable to the effective tax rate for the

year ended

December 31, 2017

. The effective tax rate for 2018 was slightly less than the statutory US tax rate primarily due to the positive impact from jurisdictional mix of earnings, largely offset by increased valuation allowances established on certain deferred tax assets, particularly related to increases in provisionally recorded estimates of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits in the US and net operating loss carryforwards in Luxembourg, due to certain restructuring transactions completed to facilitate future repatriation of cash to the US.

The higher effective tax rate for the

year ended

December 31, 2017, compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the impact of the TCJA (reflected in the Change in valuation allowance and Legislative changes lines, above), increased losses in jurisdictions with no tax benefit and current year taxes related to the restructuring of the Company's Acetate Tow segment (reflected in the US tax effect of foreign earnings and dividends and the Foreign tax credits lines, above). The increases in losses without tax benefit primarily related to

$52 million

of plant/office closure costs related to the Company's notice of termination of a contract with a key raw materials supplier at its ethanol production unit in Nanjing, China (

Note 18

), which was recorded in the Change in valuation allowance line above.

During 2017, the Company undertook various reorganization transactions to separate certain Acetate Tow assets to reorganize the holdings of its various foreign subsidiaries. As a result, the Company generated additional net foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately

$240 million

, the gross impacts of which were reflected in the Foreign tax credits line and the US tax effect of foreign earnings lines above, that will be carried forward to future tax periods. These new credit carryforwards, as well as other credits carried forward into 2017, were evaluated for realizability under the provisions of the TCJA. Due to the TCJA and uncertainty as to future sources of general limitation foreign source income to allow for utilization of these credits, the Company recorded a valuation allowance on these foreign tax credits in the amount of

$164 million

, which was reflected in the Change in valuation allowance line in the effective tax rate reconciliation above.

The lower effective tax rate for the

year ended

December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions and technical clarifications in Germany and the US of

$55 million

, reflected in the Other, net line above.



Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the consolidated deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

______________________________

(1)

For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, the tax credit carryforwards decreased primarily due to the consumption of US foreign tax credits resulting from the deemed repatriation tax required by the TCJA.

(2)

Includes deferred tax asset valuation allowances for the Company's deferred tax assets in the

US, Luxembourg, Spain, China, the United Kingdom, Canada and France

. These valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforward benefits and other net deferred tax assets, all of which may not be realizable.

Tax Carryforwards

•

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had available US federal net operating loss carryforwards of

$33 million

that are subject to limitation. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in


. As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company also had available state net operating loss carryforwards, net of federal tax impact, of

$73 million

,

$65 million

of which are offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertain recoverability. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards available as of

December 31, 2018

of

$2.1 billion

primarily for Luxembourg, China and Spain, with various expiration dates. Net operating loss carryforwards of

$450 million

in China are scheduled to expire beginning in


through


. Net operating losses in most other foreign jurisdictions do not have an expiration date.

•

Tax Credit Carryforwards

The Company had available

$301 million

of foreign tax credit carryforwards, which are mostly offset by a valuation allowance of

$277 million

due to uncertain recoverability and

$21 million

of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards in the US. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are subject to a ten-year carryforward period and expire beginning in


. The alternative minimum tax credits are subject to annual limitation due to prior ownership changes, but have an unlimited carryforward period and can be used to offset federal tax liability in future years.



The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in the applicable carryback or carryforward periods. Changes in the Company's estimates of future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies will affect the estimate of the realization of the tax benefits of these foreign tax carryforwards. As such, the Company is currently evaluating tax planning strategies to enable use of the foreign tax credit carryforwards that may decrease the Company's effective tax rate in future periods as the valuation allowance is reversed.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Activity related to uncertain tax positions is as follows:

______________________________

(1)

Includes uncertain tax positions related to the Nilit acquisition (

Note 4

) of

$4 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

(2)

This amount reflects interest on uncertain tax positions and release of certain tax positions as a result of an audit closure that was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company primarily operates in the US, Germany, Belgium, Canada, China, Mexico and Singapore. Examinations are ongoing in a number of these jurisdictions. The Company's US tax returns for the years 2009 through 2015 are currently under audit by the US Internal Revenue Service. Outside of the US, the Company's German tax returns for the years 2008 through 2015 are under audit as well as certain of the Company's other subsidiaries within their respective jurisdictions.

The increase in uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to progress of tax examinations. While it is reasonably possible that a further change in the unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months related to the settlement of one or more of these audits, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of any such change.

In connection with the Company's US federal income tax audit for 2009 and 2010, the Company has received

$192 million

of proposed pre-tax adjustments related to various intercompany charges. In January 2018, the Company received proposed pre-tax adjustments for its 2011 and 2012 audit cycle in the amount of

$198 million

. The Company has entered the appeals process for the 2009 and 2010 exam cycle. In the event the Company is wholly unsuccessful in its defense and absent expected off-setting adjustments from foreign tax authorities, the proposed adjustments would result in the consumption of approximately

$136 million

of foreign tax credit carryforwards. The Company believes these proposed adjustments to be without merit and is vigorously defending its position.



20. Management Compensation Plans

General Plan Description

On April 19, 2018, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2018 GIP, effective April 23, 2018 (the "Effective Date"). Upon the Effective Date, no additional awards will be made under the 2009 Global Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2009 GIP"). The total number of shares of Common Stock for which awards may be granted under the 2018 GIP shall be (i)

2,500,000

new shares of Common Stock plus (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock available for future awards under the 2009 GIP as of the Effective Date, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to outstanding equity awards under the 2009 GIP as of the Effective Date but may again become available for grants of awards under the 2018 GIP if an outstanding award under the 2009 GIP terminates by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of such shares for awards not involving shares of Common Stock as provided in the 2018 GIP.

The 2018 GIP enables the compensation committee of the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors as to non-management directors) to award incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, shares of Common Stock, restricted stock awards, RSUs and incentive bonuses (which may be paid in cash or stock or a combination thereof), any of which may be performance-based, with vesting and other award provisions that provide effective incentive to Company employees (including officers), non-management directors and other service providers.

Total shares available for awards and total shares subject to outstanding awards are as follows:

Restricted Stock Units

A summary of changes in nonvested performance-based RSUs outstanding is as follows:

The fair value of shares vested for performance-based RSUs is as follows:



A summary of changes in nonvested time-based RSUs outstanding is as follows:

The fair value of shares vested for time-based RSUs is as follows:

The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted is as follows:

As of

December 31, 2018

, there was

$62 million

of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs, excluding actual forfeitures, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

two

years.

The Company realized income tax benefits from RSU vestings as follows:



21. Leases

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable rental and lease agreements, which have initial or remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows:

The Company expects that, in the normal course of business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by other leases.

Rent expense recorded under all operating leases is as follows:

22. Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives Designated As Hedges

Cash Flow Hedges

The total notional amount of the forward-starting interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge is as follows:



Net Investment Hedges

The total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge of net investments in foreign operations are as follows:

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedges

Foreign Currency Forwards and Swaps

Each of the contracts included in the table below will have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables, receivables, intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement. The total US dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency are as follows:

Gross notional values of the foreign currency forwards and swaps are as follows:

Hedging activity for foreign currency forwards and commodity swaps is as follows:



Information regarding changes in the fair value of the Company's derivative and non-derivative instruments is as follows:

See

Note 23

for additional information regarding the fair value of the Company's derivative instruments.

Certain of the Company's commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps permit the Company to net settle all contracts with the counterparty through a single payment in an agreed upon currency in the event of default or early termination of the contract, similar to a master netting arrangement.

Information regarding the gross amounts of the Company's derivative instruments and the amounts offset in the consolidated balance sheets is as follows:



23. Fair Value Measurements

The Company's financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (

Note 2

) as follows:

Derivatives.

Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps and are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are observable in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.



Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are as follows:

In general, the equity investments included in the table above are not publicly traded and their fair values are not readily determinable; however, the Company believes the carrying values approximate or are less than the fair values. Insurance contracts in nonqualified trusts consist of long-term fixed income securities, which are valued using independent vendor pricing models with observable inputs in the active market and therefore represent a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of long-term debt is based on valuations from third-party banks and market quotations and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The fair value of obligations under capital leases, which are included in long-term debt, is based on lease payments and discount rates, which are not observable in the market and therefore represents a Level 3 fair value measurement.

As of

December 31, 2018

and


, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payables, short-term borrowings and the current installments of long-term debt approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These items have been excluded from the table with the exception of the current installments of long-term debt.

24. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

Guarantees

The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements, leases, settlement agreements and various agreements with affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, others do not provide such limitations.

As indemnification obligations often depend on the occurrence of unpredictable future events, the future costs associated with them cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims. These known obligations include the following:

•

Demerger Obligations

In connection with the Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, for various liabilities under the demerger agreement, including for environmental liabilities associated with contamination arising either from environmental damage in general ("Category A") or under


divestiture agreements entered into by Hoechst prior to the demerger ("Category B") (

Note 16

).

The Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, is capped under Category B at

€250 million

. If and to the extent the environmental damage should exceed

€750 million

in aggregate, the Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors applies, but is then limited to

33.33%

of the remediation cost without further limitations. Cumulative payments under the divestiture agreements as of

December 31, 2018

are

$89 million

. Most of the divestiture agreements have become time barred and/or any notified environmental damage claims have been partially settled.



The Company has also undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for (i)

33.33%

of any and all Category A liabilities that result from Hoechst being held as the responsible party pursuant to public law or current or future environmental law or by third parties pursuant to private or public law related to contamination and (ii) liabilities that Hoechst is required to discharge, including tax liabilities, which are associated with businesses that were included in the demerger but were not demerged due to legal restrictions on the transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not been requested by Hoechst to make any payments in connection with this indemnification. Accordingly, the Company has not made any payments to Hoechst and its legal successors.

Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the lack of requests for indemnification, the Company cannot estimate the remaining demerger obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.

•

Divestiture Obligations

The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees represent standard contractual terms associated with typical divestiture agreements and, other than environmental liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the Company to any significant risk (

Note 16

).

The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, which extend through


. The aggregate amount of outstanding indemnifications and guarantees provided for under these agreements is

$116 million

as of

December 31, 2018

. Other agreements do not provide for any monetary or time limitations.

Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the number of requests for indemnification or other payment received by the Company, the Company cannot estimate the remaining divestiture obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.

Purchase Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various purchase commitments for goods and services. The Company maintains a number of "take-or-pay" contracts for purchases of raw materials, utilities and other services. Certain of the contracts contain a contract termination buy-out provision that allows for the Company to exit the contracts for amounts less than the remaining take-or-pay obligations. Additionally, the Company has other outstanding commitments representing maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts and software agreements. As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of

$1.4 billion

, which extend through


.

Contingencies

The Company is involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of business, relating to such matters as product liability, land disputes, contracts, employment, antitrust or competition compliance, intellectual property, personal injury and other actions in tort, workers' compensation, chemical exposure, asbestos exposure, taxes, trade compliance, acquisitions and divestitures, claims of legacy stockholders, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment. The Company is actively defending those matters where the Company is named as a defendant and, based on the current facts, does not believe the outcomes from these matters would be material to the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

European Commission Investigation

In May 2017, the Company learned that the European Commission has opened a competition law investigation involving certain subsidiaries of the Company with respect to certain ethylene purchases. The Company is cooperating with the European Commission. Because the investigation is on-going and the many uncertainties and variables involved, the Company is unable at this time to determine the outcome of this investigation and whether, and in what amount, any potential fines would be assessed.



25. Supplemental Cash Flow Information

26. Segment Information

Business Segments

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company reorganized its operating and reportable segments to align with recent structural and management reporting changes. The changes reflect the movement of its food ingredients business from the Consumer Specialties reportable segment into the Engineered Materials reportable segment. In addition, the former Consumer Specialties reportable segment was renamed the Acetate Tow segment, and the former Advanced Engineered Materials reportable segment was renamed the Engineered Materials segment. This reorganization better reflects how the Company manages its food ingredients' related products commercially. Engineered Materials and food ingredients are both project-based models that focus on delivering customized solutions and are led by the same senior management team.

Effective December 31, 2018, the Company further reorganized its operating and reportable segments to align with recent structural and management reporting changes. The change reflects the resegmentation of the former Industrial Specialties and former Acetyl Intermediates operating and reportable segments, to the Acetyl Chain operating and reportable segment. This reorganization reflects the culmination of a shift in operating strategy and organizational hierarchy, with a focus on integration, collaboration and maximization of value creation through its global optionality and integrated chain model of the underlying businesses along the Acetyl Chain segment.

The Company operates through business segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of its products and customer relationships, as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the Company's key decision maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer.

The Company's business segments are as follows:

•

Engineered Materials

The Company's Engineered Materials segment includes the engineered materials business, our food ingredients business and certain strategic affiliates. The engineered materials business develops, produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance specialty polymers for automotive and medical applications, as well as industrial products and consumer electronics. Together with its strategic affiliates, the Company's engineered materials business is a leading participant in the global specialty polymers industry. The primary products of Engineered Materials are used in a broad range of end-use products including fuel system components, automotive safety systems, medical applications, electronics, appliances, industrial products, battery separators, conveyor belts, filtration equipment, coatings, and electrical applications and products. It is also a leading global supplier of acesulfame potassium for the food and beverage industry and is a leading producer of food protection ingredients, such as potassium sorbate and sorbic acid.

•

Acetate Tow

The Company's Acetate Tow segment serves consumer-driven applications and is a leading global producer and supplier of acetate tow and acetate flake, primarily used in filter products applications.



•

Acetyl Chain

The Company's Acetyl Chain segment includes the integrated chain of intermediate chemistry, emulsion polymers and ethylene vinyl acetate ("EVA") polymers businesses, based on similar products, production processes, classes of customers and selling and distribution practices as well as economic similarities over a normal business cycle. The Company's intermediate chemistry business produces and supplies acetyl products, including acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer, acetic anhydride and acetate esters. These products are generally used as starting materials for colorants, paints, adhesives, coatings and pharmaceuticals. It also produces organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical products. The Company's emulsion polymers business is a leading global producer of vinyl acetate-based emulsions and develops products and application technologies to improve performance, create value and drive innovation in applications such as paints and coatings, adhesives, construction, glass fiber, textiles and paper. The Company's EVA polymers business is a leading North American manufacturer of a full range of specialty EVA resins and compounds, as well as select grades of low-density polyethylene. The Company's EVA polymers products are used in many applications, including flexible packaging films, lamination film products, hot melt adhesives, automotive parts and carpeting.

•

Other Activities

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs, including administrative activities such as finance, information technology and human resource functions, interest income and expense associated with financing activities and results of the Company's captive insurance companies. Other Activities also includes the components of net periodic benefit cost (interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses) for the Company's defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans not allocated to the Company's business segments.

The business segment management reporting and controlling systems are based on the same accounting policies as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (

Note 2

).



Sales transactions between business segments are generally recorded at values that approximate third-party selling prices.

27. Revenue

Disaggregated Revenue

In general, the Company's business segmentation is aligned according to the nature and economic characteristics of its products and customer relationships and provides meaningful disaggregation of each business segment's results of operations.

The Company manages its Engineered Materials business segment through its project management pipeline, which is comprised of a broad range of projects which are solutions-based and are tailored to each customers' unique needs. Projects are identified and selected based on success rate and may involve a number of different polymers per project for use in multiple end-use applications. Therefore, the Company is agnostic toward products and end-use markets for the Engineered Materials business segment.

Within the Acetate Tow business segment, the Company's primary product is acetate tow, which is managed through contracts with a few major tobacco companies and accounts for a significant amount of filters used in cigarette production worldwide.

The Company manages its Acetyl Chain business segment by leveraging its ability to sell chemicals externally to end-use markets or downstream to its emulsion polymers business. Decisions to sell externally and geographically or downstream and along the Acetyl Chain are based on market demand, trade flows and maximizing the value of its chemicals. Therefore, the Company's strategic focus is on executing within this integrated chain model and less on driving product-specific revenue.



Further disaggregation of Net sales by business segment and geographic destination is as follows:

29. Consolidating Guarantor Financial Information

The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US ("Issuer") and are guaranteed by Celanese Corporation ("Parent Guarantor") and the Subsidiary Guarantors (

Note 14

). The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors are

100%

owned subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. The Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors have guaranteed the Notes fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally.

For cash management purposes, the Company transfers cash between the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors and non-guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Company's outstanding debt, Common Stock dividends and Common Stock repurchases. The consolidating statements of cash flow present such intercompany financing activities, contributions and dividends consistent with how such activity would be presented in a stand-alone statement of cash flows.

The Company has not presented separate financial information and other disclosures for each of its Subsidiary Guarantors because it believes such financial information and other disclosures would not provide investors with any additional information that would be material in evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees.

The consolidating financial information for the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the non-guarantors are as follows:

30. Subsequent Events

On January 7, 2019, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiary borrowers entered into a new credit agreement with a group of lenders. The new agreement is substantially the same as the prior Credit Agreement, except that the facility was increased to

$1.25 billion

and the maturity date was extended to January 2024.

On January 2, 2019, using cash on hand, the Company completed the acquisition of

100%

of the ownership interests of Next Polymers Ltd., an India-based engineering thermoplastics ("ETP") compounder. The acquisition strengthens the Company's position in the Indian ETP market and further expands the Company's global manufacturing footprint. The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination, and the acquired operations will be included in the Engineered Materials segment beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The Company has not presented a purchase price allocation related to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed because the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete as of the issuance date of the financial statements. The acquisition is not expected to be material to the Company's 2019 financial position or results of operations.
