Products
    and Services

The Company markets its products worldwide through two operating
    groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and
    the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). EIG builds
    monitoring, testing, calibration and display devices for the
    process, aerospace, industrial and power markets. EMG is a
    supplier of electromechanical devices. EMG produces highly
    engineered electromechanical connectors for hermetic
    (moisture-proof) applications, specialty metals for niche
    markets, and brushless air-moving motors, blowers, and heat
    exchangers. End markets include aerospace, defense, mass
    transit, medical and office products. The Company believes that
    EMG is the world’s largest manufacturer of air-moving
    electric motors for vacuum cleaners, and is a prominent producer
    of motors for other floor care products. The Company continues
    to grow through strategic acquisitions focused on differentiated
    niche markets in instrumentation and electromechanical devices.

Competitive
    Strengths

Management believes that the Company has several significant
    competitive advantages that assist it in sustaining and
    enhancing its market positions. Its principal strengths include:

Significant Market Share.

AMETEK maintains a
    significant share in many of its targeted niche markets because
    of its ability to produce and deliver high-quality products at
    competitive prices. In EIG, the Company maintains significant
    market positions in many niche segments within the process,
    aerospace, industrial, and power instrumentation markets. In
    EMG, the Company maintains significant market positions in many
    niche segments including aerospace, defense, mass transit,
    medical, office products, and air-moving motors for the floor
    care market.

Technological and Development
    Capabilities.

AMETEK believes it has certain
    technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to
    develop innovative products and maintain leading market
    positions. Historically, the Company has grown by extending its
    technical expertise into the manufacture of customized products
    for its customers, as well as through strategic acquisitions.
    EIG competes primarily on the basis of product innovation in
    several highly specialized instrumentation markets, including
    process measurement, aerospace, power, and heavy-vehicle
    dashboard instrumentation. EMG’s differentiated businesses
    focus on developing customized products for specialized
    applications in aerospace and defense, medical, business


machines and other industrial applications. In its cost-driven
    motor business, EMG focuses on low-cost design and
    manufacturing, while enhancing motor-blower performance through
    advances in power, efficiency, lighter weight and quieter
    operation.

Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing
    Operations.

EMG has motor manufacturing plants in
    China, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Brazil to lower its costs
    and achieve strategic proximity to its customers, providing the
    opportunity to increase international sales and market share.
    Certain of the Company’s electronic instrument businesses
    are also relocating manufacturing operations to low-cost
    locales. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and joint ventures
    in Europe, North America and Asia have resulted in additional
    cost savings and synergies through the consolidation of
    operations, product lines and distribution channels that benefit
    both operating groups.

Experienced Management Team.

Another key
    component of AMETEK’s success is the strength of its
    management team and its commitment to the performance of the
    Company. AMETEK’s senior management has extensive
    experience, averaging approximately 23 years with the
    Company, and is financially committed to the Company’s
    success through Company-established stock ownership guidelines,
    and equity incentive programs.

Business
    Strategy

AMETEK’s objectives are to increase the Company’s
    earnings and financial returns through a combination of
    operational and financial strategies. Those operational
    strategies include business acquisitions, new product
    development, global and market expansion, and Operational
    Excellence programs designed to achieve double-digit annual
    percentage growth in earnings per share and a superior return on
    total capital. To support those operational objectives,
    financial initiatives have been, or may be, undertaken,
    including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt
    refinancing, local financing in certain foreign countries,
    accounts receivable securitization and share repurchases.
    AMETEK’s commitment to earnings growth is reflected in its
    continued implementation of cost-reduction programs designed to
    achieve the Company’s long-term best-cost objectives.

AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key
    strategies:

Operational Excellence.

Operational Excellence
    is AMETEK’s cornerstone strategy for improving profit
    margins and strengthening the Company’s competitive
    position across its businesses. Through its Operational
    Excellence strategy, the Company seeks to reduce production
    costs and improve its market positions. The strategy has played
    a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies.
    AMETEK believes that Operational Excellence, which focuses on
    Six Sigma process improvements, global sourcing and lean
    manufacturing, and also emphasizes team building and a
    participative management culture, has enabled the Company to
    improve operating efficiencies and product quality, increase
    customer satisfaction and yield higher cash flow from
    operations, while lowering operating and administrative costs
    and shortening manufacturing cycle times.

New Product Development.

Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The
    Company continues to pursue strategic acquisitions, both
    domestically and internationally, to expand and strengthen its
    product lines, improve its market share positions and increase
    earnings through sales growth and operational efficiencies at
    the acquired businesses. Since the beginning of 2004, to the
    date of this report, the Company has completed 17 acquisitions
    with annualized sales totaling approximately $730 million,
    including seven acquisitions in 2007 representing approximately

Operating
    Performance

In 2007, AMETEK generated sales of $2.1 billion, an
    increase of 17% from 2006, and increased net income by 25%. The
    Company set records for sales, operating income, net income and
    diluted earnings per share. This strong performance was driven
    by strong internal growth in each of the Company’s two
    reportable segments, the contribution of recently acquired
    businesses and the Company’s continuing cost reduction
    initiatives. Additionally, AMETEK generated record cash flow
    from operating activities during 2007 that totaled
    $278.5 million, a 23% increase from 2006.

Financing

The accounts receivable securitization facility was amended and
    restated in May 2007 to increase the Company’s available

    well as extend the expiration date from May 2007 to May 2008. In
    June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility,
    increasing the total


borrowing capacity from $400 million to $550 million,
    which includes an accordion feature that permits the Company to
    request up to an additional $100 million in revolving
    credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving
    credit agreement under certain conditions. The amendment also
    extended the term of the facility from October 2011 to June
    2012. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a
    private placement agreement to sell $450 million in senior
    notes to a group of institutional investors. There are two
    funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred
    in December 2007 for $370 million, consisting of
    $270 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due
    December 2019. The second funding date will be in July 2008 for

    complement our AMPHION product line of power management products
    for the aerospace industry and will broaden our product offering
    in the power management subsystem market.

B&S Aircraft Parts & Accessories
    (“B&S”), also acquired in June 2007, provides
    third-party MRO services, primarily for starter generators and
    hydraulic and fuel system components, for a variety of business
    aircraft and helicopter applications.

Customers

EIG is not dependent on any single customer such that the loss
    of that customer would have a material adverse effect on
    EIG’s operations. Approximately 12% of EIG’s 2007
    sales were made to its five largest customers, and no one
    customer accounted for 10% or more of 2007 consolidated sales.


EMG

EMG is among the leaders in many of the specialized markets it
    serves, including highly engineered motors, blowers, fans, heat
    exchangers, connectors, and other electromechanical products or
    systems for commercial and military aerospace applications,
    defense, medical equipment, business machines and computers and
    other power or industrial applications. In its cost-driven motor
    business, the Company believes that EMG is the world’s
    largest producer of high-speed, air-moving electric motors for
    OEMs of floor care products. EMG designs products that, in many
    instances, are significantly different from, or technologically
    better than, competing products. It has reduced costs by
    implementing operational improvements, achieving acquisition
    synergies, improving supply chain management, moving production
    to low-cost locales and reducing headcount. Approximately 43% of
    EMG’s 2007 sales were to customers outside the United
    States.

EMG employs approximately 5,600 people, of whom
    approximately 2,200 are covered by collective bargaining
    agreements (including some that are covered by local unions). It
    has 42 manufacturing facilities: 24 in the United States, eight
    in the United Kingdom, three in France, two in Italy, two in
    Mexico, one in China, one in the Czech Republic, and one in
    Brazil.

Differentiated
    Businesses

Differentiated businesses account for an increasing proportion
    of EMG’s overall sales base. Differentiated businesses
    represented 69% of EMG’s sales in 2007 and are comprised of
    the engineered materials, interconnects and packaging businesses
    and the technical motors and systems businesses.

Engineered
    Materials, Interconnects and Packaging Markets and
    Products

Approximately 29% of EMG sales are engineered materials,
    interconnects and packaging products. AMETEK is an innovator and
    market leader in specialized metal powder, strip, wire, and
    bonded products. It produces stainless steel and nickel clad
    alloys; stainless steel, cobalt, and nickel alloy powders; metal

    to the Company’s position in highly engineered hermetically
    sealed electrical interconnects and microelectronic packaging
    used to protect sophisticated electronics in aerospace, defense,
    telecommunications and industrial applications.

Technical
    Motors and Systems Markets and Products

Technical motors and systems, representing 40% of EMG’s
    2007 sales, consist of brushless motors, blowers and pumps as
    well as other electromechanical systems. These products are used
    in aerospace, business machines, computer equipment, defense,
    mass transit vehicles, medical equipment, power, and industrial
    applications.

EMG produces electronically commutated (brushless) motors,
    blowers and pumps that offer long life, reliability and near
    maintenance-free operation. These motor-blower systems and heat
    exchangers are used for thermal management and other
    applications on a wide variety of military and commercial
    aircraft and military ground vehicles, and are used increasingly
    in medical and other applications, in which their long life,
    spark-free and reliable operation is very important. These
    motors provide cooling and ventilation for business machines,
    computers, and mass transit vehicles. In the emerging fuel cell
    market, AMETEK is working closely with many of the leading
    developers of fuel cell technology to produce blowers and pumps
    specifically developed for these applications.


EMG’s Prestolite switch business produces solenoids and
    other electromechanical devices for the motive and stationary
    power markets. The Prestolite battery charger business
    manufactures high-quality industrial battery chargers for use in
    the materials handling market. Both the switch and battery
    charger businesses have strong market positions and enjoy a
    reputation for high quality and service.

PennEngineering Motion Technologies, acquired in May 2006, is a
    leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered motors
    for niche applications in the data storage, medical, electronic
    equipment, factory automation and aviation markets.

Southern Aeroparts Inc., acquired in December 2006, enabled the
    Company to establish a meaningful presence in the third-party
    MRO business providing repair and overhaul services on
    hydraulic, pneumatic and electromechanical components. These
    include power control units, hydraulic actuators, hydraulic
    flight controls, cargo handling systems, fans and blowers,
    airframe and power actuation systems.

Umeco R&O, acquired in November 2007, provides an extensive
    array of MRO services for electrical and electronic equipment,
    fluid power devices, hydraulic components, actuation systems,
    landing gear, wheels and brakes, and safety equipment. Umeco
    R&O operates from multiple locations in the United Kingdom
    and Toulouse, France.

Floor
    Care and Specialty Motor Markets and Products

Approximately 31% of EMG sales are to floor care and specialty
    motor markets, where it has the leading share, through its sales
    of air-moving electric motors to most of the world’s major
    floor care OEMs, including vertically integrated OEMs that
    produce some of their own motors. EMG produces motor-blowers for
    a full range of floor care products, ranging from hand-held,
    canister, and upright vacuums to central vacuums for residential
    use. High-performance vacuum motors also are marketed for
    commercial and industrial applications.

The Company also manufactures a variety of specialty motors used
    in a wide range of products, such as household and personal care
    appliances; fitness equipment; electric materials handling
    vehicles; and sewing machines. Additionally, its products are
    used in outdoor power equipment, such as electric chain saws,
    leaf blowers, string trimmers and power washers.

EMG has been successful in directing a portion of its global
    floor care marketing at vertically integrated vacuum cleaner
    manufacturers, who seek to outsource all or part of their motor
    production. By purchasing their motors from EMG, these customers
    are able to realize economic and operational advantages by
    reducing or discontinuing their own motor production and
    avoiding the capital investment required to keep their motor
    manufacturing current with changing technologies and market
    demands.

EMG focuses its new product development on reducing costs and
    achieving performance enhancements from its motors and
    motor-blowers. The latest generations of ADVANTEK II and

INFIN-A-TEK

vacuum motors incorporate environmentally friendly features,
    including innovations in fan design, materials and assembly
    techniques that allow for higher performance, greater
    efficiency, reduced noise, long life and better indoor air
    quality.

Customers

EMG is not dependent on any single customer such that the loss
    of that customer would have a material adverse effect on
    EMG’s operations. Approximately 14% of EMG’s sales for
    2007 were made to its five largest customers, and no one
    customer accounted for 10% or more of 2007 consolidated sales.

Marketing

The Company’s marketing efforts generally are organized and
    carried out at the division level. EIG makes significant use of
    distributors and sales representatives in marketing its
    products, as well as direct sales in some of its more
    technically sophisticated products. Within aerospace, its
    specialized customer base of aircraft and jet engine
    manufacturers is served primarily by direct sales engineers.
    Given the technical nature of many of its products as well as
    its significant worldwide market share, EMG conducts most of its
    domestic and international marketing


activities through a direct sales force and makes some use of
    sales representatives and distributors both in the United States
    and in other countries.

Competition

In general, most of the Company’s markets are highly
    competitive. The principal elements of competition for the
    Company’s products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality, and service.

In the markets served by EIG, the Company believes that it ranks
    among the leading U.S. producers of certain measuring and
    control instruments. It also is a leader in the
    U.S. heavy-vehicle instrumentation and power instrument
    markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers
    to the commercial aviation market. Competition remains strong
    and can intensify for certain EIG products, especially its
    pressure gauge and heavy-vehicle instrumentation products. Both
    of these businesses have several strong competitors. In the
    process and analytical instruments market, numerous companies in
    each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality,
    performance and innovation. The aerospace and power instrument
    businesses have a number of diversified competitors, which vary
    depending on the specific market niche.

EMG’s differentiated businesses have competition from a
    limited number of companies in each of their markets.
    Competition is generally based on product innovation,
    performance and price. There also is competition from
    alternative materials and processes. In its cost-driven
    businesses, EMG has limited domestic competition in the
    U.S. floor care market from independent manufacturers.
    Competition is increasing from Asian motor manufacturers that
    serve both the U.S. and the European floor care markets.
    Increasingly, global vacuum motor production is being shifted to
    Asia where AMETEK has a smaller but growing market position.
    There is potential competition from vertically integrated
    manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own
    motor-blowers. Many of these manufacturers would also be
    potential EMG customers if they decided to outsource their motor
    production.

Backlog
    and Seasonal Variations of Business

The Company’s approximate backlog of unfilled orders by
    business segment at the dates specified below was as follows:

December 31,




(In millions)

Electronic Instruments

The higher backlog at December 31, 2007 was primarily due
    to the seven businesses acquired in 2007, as well as increased
    order rates, primarily in the Company’s differentiated
    businesses.

Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31,
    2007, approximately 85% is expected to be shipped by
    December 31, 2008. The Company believes that neither its
    business as a whole, nor either of its reportable segments, is
    subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain
    individual operations experience some seasonal variability.

Availability
    of Raw Materials

The Company’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and
    supplies from a variety of sources, and generally from more than
    one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various
    base metals and certain steel components, are available only
    from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes its
    sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs.


Research,
    Product Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development, and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development, and engineering costs
    before customer reimbursement were $102.9 million,
    $87.6 million and $75.9 million, in 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were $7.1 million, $6.4 million and
    $8.9 million, respectively. These amounts included

net Company-funded

research and development expenses of $52.9 million,
    $42.0 million and $34.8 million, respectively. All
    such expenditures were directed toward the development of new
    products and processes, and the improvement of existing products
    and processes.

Environmental
    Matters

Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth
    on pages

32-33

of
    this report in the section of Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    entitled “Environmental Matters”.

Patents,
    Licenses and Trademarks

The Company owns numerous unexpired U.S. patents and
    foreign patents, including counterparts of its more important
    U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the
    world. The Company is a licensor or licensee under patent
    agreements of various types, and its products are marketed under
    various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign
    trademarks and trade names. However, the Company does not
    consider any single patent or trademark, or any group thereof,
    essential either to its business as a whole or to either of its
    business segments. The annual royalties received or paid under
    license agreements are not significant to either of its
    reportable segments or to the Company’s overall operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2007, the Company employed approximately
    11,300 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of
    whom approximately 2,900 employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. The Company has four
    collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2008, which
    cover less than 250 employees. The Company expects no
    material adverse effects from the pending labor contract
    negotiations.

Working
    Capital Practices

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital
    requirements in either of its reportable segments. Customers
    generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include
    extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled
    and maintained at levels related to production cycles, and are
    responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all
    other information contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect
    our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Our
    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be
    able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate
    recent and future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of
    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2004, we have
    completed 17 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic
    acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden
    our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our
    acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfully
    effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of
    factors, including:

•

Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;


•

The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may
    increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate
    acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a
    greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;

•

Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including
    integrating the financial, technological and management
    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses
    with those of our existing operations;

•

Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms
    acceptable to us;

•

U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting
    our ability to make certain acquisitions;

•

Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of
    acquired businesses;

•

Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

•

Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity
    and complexity of our operations.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing
    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and
    may require additional financial resources and attention from
    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing
    development or expansion of our existing operations.
    Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired
    business may not achieve the results we expected or produce
    expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue
    with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of
    acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

We may
    experience unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    product line transfers.

Certain of our businesses are relocating, or have recently
    relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
    Unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    completing product line transfers, as well as possible
    underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in
    production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our
    business and operations.

Our
    substantial international sales and operations are subject to
    customary risks associated with international
    operations.

International sales for 2007 and 2006 represented approximately
    49% and 48% of our total net sales, respectively. As a result of
    our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales
    outside the United States will increase in the future.
    International operations are subject to the customary risks of
    operating in an international environment, including:

•

Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;

•

Overlap of different tax structures;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including
    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries
    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;

•

Restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

General economic conditions;

•

Unstable political situations;

•

Nationalization of assets; and

•

Compliance with a wide variety of international and
    U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.


Our
    international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by
    compliance with export laws.

We are required to comply with various import, export, export
    control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our
    transactions with certain customers, business partners and other
    persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our
    employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export
    control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the
    export of certain products, services and technologies, and in
    other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export
    license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure
    to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil
    and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions
    to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export
    products and services, and damage to our reputation.

Any
    inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to
    compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate
    acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results
    from those businesses, manage our expanding international
    operations, and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if
    we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the
    expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and
    employees may adversely affect our results of operations.

If we
    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could
    adversely affect our business and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our
    ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced
    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.
    Although we believe we have certain technological and other
    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages
    will require us to continue investing in research and
    development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance
    that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments,
    that we will be able to make the technological advances
    necessary to maintain such competitive advantages, or that we
    can recover major research and development expenses. We are not
    currently aware of any emerging standards or new products, which
    could render our existing products obsolete, although there can
    be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able
    to develop and successfully market new products.

A
    shortage of, or price increases in, our raw materials could
    increase our operating costs.

We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material
    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;
    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel
    components, are available only from a limited number of
    suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations.
    Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could
    affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our
    competitive position, which could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Certain
    environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs
    associated with hazardous or toxic substance

clean-up

which may adversely affect our financial
    condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a
    number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
    occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning,
    among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the
    use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage,
    transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
    Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing
    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous
    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of
    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at
    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew
    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous
    materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint
    and several liability for

clean-up

costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing
    hazardous substances to sites designated for

clean-up

under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible
    party at several sites, which are the subject of
    government-mandated

clean-ups.

As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that
    use, manufacture, store, handle


and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur
    substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and
    capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental
    laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the
    potential financial impact of pending environmental matters,
    based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of
    these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on
    our financial position or future results of operations. In
    addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of
    hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and
    regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination
    or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis
    for new or increased liabilities that could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. There can be no assurance that future
    environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental
    damages due to prior or present practices will not result in
    future liabilities.

We are
    subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be
    burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and
    foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing
    laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new
    laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us.
    We cannot predict the impact any of these will have on our
    business or operations.

We may
    be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with
    alleged or actual harm caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product
    liability claims in the event that the use of our products is
    alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For
    example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for
    personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for
    example, an aircraft component that has been designed,
    manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur significant
    liability if product liability lawsuits against us are
    successful. While we believe our current general liability and
    product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from
    future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate
    to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be
    able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an
    acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for
    which third-party indemnification is not available could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We
    operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely
    affect our results of operations or ability to expand our
    business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and
    internationally, with individual producers as well as with
    vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have
    resources greater than we do. The principal elements of
    competition for our products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality and service. EMG’s competition in
    specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and
    processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG
    is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify.
    In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets
    served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the
    basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our
    competitors may develop new, or improve existing products that
    are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new
    technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There
    can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely
    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
    operates or that our products will be able to compete
    successfully with those of our competitors.

A
    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely
    affect our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in
    nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control.
    A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.


Restrictions
    contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt
    agreements may limit our ability to incur additional
    indebtedness.

Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements
    contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our
    ability to incur additional indebtedness. These restrictions
    could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or
    restrict our financial flexibility.

Our
    goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial
    amount of our total assets and write-off of such substantial
    goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets,
    primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill and
    other intangible assets totaled approximately
    $1,358 million, or about 49% of our total assets. The
    goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess
    of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other
    identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum,
    we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the
    value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance
    at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly
    below current levels, we could reflect, under current applicable
    accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for
    goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination
    requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or
    other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial
    condition and results of operations.

The Company has 87 operating plant facilities in 20 states
    and 12 foreign countries. Of these facilities, 54 are owned by
    the Company and 33 are leased. The properties owned by the
    Company consist of approximately 653 acres, of which
    approximately 6.2 million square feet are under roof. Under
    lease is a total of approximately 1,350,000 square feet.
    The leases expire over a range of years from 2008 to 2040, with
    renewal options for varying terms contained in most of the
    leases. Production facilities in Taiwan, China and Japan provide
    the Company with additional production capacity through the
    Company’s investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures.
    The Company’s executive offices in Paoli, PA, occupy
    approximately 34,000 square feet under a lease that expires
    in September 2010.

The Company’s machinery and equipment, plants, and offices
    are in satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the
    uses to which they are put. The operating facilities of the
    Company by business segment are summarized in the following

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company

and/or

its
    subsidiaries have been named as defendants, along with many
    other companies, in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. To
    date, no judgments have been entered against the Company. The
    Company believes it has strong defenses to the claims, and
    intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these
    matters. Other companies are also indemnifying the Company
    against certain of these claims. To date, these parties have met
    their obligations in all material respects; however, one of
    these companies recently filed for bankruptcy liquidation. (Also
    see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) and Note 16 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Item 4.

    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company’s
    security holders, through the solicitation of proxies or
    otherwise, during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended

EBITDA represents income before
    interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is
    presented because the Company is aware that it is used by rating
    agencies, securities analysts, investors and other parties in
    evaluating the Company. It should not be considered, however, as
    an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the
    Company’s operating performance, or as an alternative to
    cash flows as a measure of the Company’s overall liquidity
    as presented in the Company’s financial statements.
    Furthermore, EBITDA measures shown for the Company may not be
    comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

    information on these and other factors, see
    “Forward-Looking Information” on page 34.

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 6.
    Selected Financial Data” and the consolidated financial
    statements of the Company and the related notes included
    elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

We begin our MD&A with an overview of our business and
    operations.

Business
    Overview

As a global business, AMETEK’s operations are affected by
    global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the
    Company’s strategic geographic and industry
    diversification, and its mix of products and services, have
    helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable
    developments in any one industry or the economy of any single
    country on its consolidated operating results. In 2007, the
    Company continued to experience strong market conditions in many
    of its businesses. Strong internal growth and the contributions
    from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational
    Excellence initiatives, enabled the Company to post another year
    of record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings
    per share, and cash flow from operating activities in 2007. In
    addition to achieving its financial objectives, the Company also
    benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEK’s
    four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product
    Development, Global and Market Expansion, and Strategic
    Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2007 were:

•

Sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of $318 million
    or 17% from 2006 on solid internal growth of approximately 9% in
    the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and 6% in the
    Electromechanical Group (EMG), and contributions from the
    following acquisitions completed during the year:

•

In April 2007, the Company acquired Seacon Phoenix, subsequently
    renamed Sea Connect Products (“SCP”), a provider of
    undersea electrical interconnect subsystems. The SCP acquisition
    is an excellent strategic fit with the Company’s engineered
    materials, interconnects and packaging business and extends the
    Company’s reach into new defense markets.

•

In June 2007, the Company acquired Hamilton Precision Metals,
    Inc. (“Hamilton”), a niche specialty metals producer.
    The Hamilton acquisition is a strategic fit with our engineered
    materials, interconnects and packaging business and has strong
    positions in growing specialty metals niche markets within the
    aerospace and other industrial markets.

•

In June 2007, the Company acquired two aerospace businesses;
    B&S Aircraft Parts & Accessories
    (“B&S”) and Advanced Industries, Inc.
    (“Advanced”) that serve the business jet, regional jet
    and helicopter markets. These businesses strengthen the
    Company’s position in the aircraft power management and
    third-party maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) markets.

•

In August 2007, the Company acquired CAMECA SAS
    (“Cameca”), a manufacturer of high-end elemental
    analysis systems used in advanced laboratory research,
    semiconductor and nanotechnology applications. The Cameca
    acquisition broadens the Company’s technical capabilities
    in high-end elemental analysis systems.

•

In November 2007, the Company acquired the Repair &
    Overhaul Division of Umeco plc (“Umeco”), a leading
    independent provider of MRO services in the aviation industry in
    Europe. The Umeco acquisition provides third-party MRO services
    for a variety of helicopters and commercial and regional
    aircraft throughout Europe.


•

In December 2007, the Company acquired California Instruments
    Corporation, a leader in programmable alternating current (AC)
    power sources used to test electrical and electronic products,
    with an especially strong position in the high-power segment of
    the market.

•

As the Company grows globally, it continues to achieve an
    increasing level of international sales. International sales,
    including U.S. export sales, represented 49.3% of
    consolidated sales in 2007, compared with 47.6% of consolidated
    sales in 2006.

•

Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow from operating
    activities that totaled $278.5 million, a
    $52.5 million or 23.2% increase from 2006. At year-end
    2007, our total debt-to-capital ratio was 42.1% compared with
    41.4%, at the end of 2006.

•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research,
    development and engineering, spending $102.9 million in
    2007 before customer reimbursement of $7.1 million, an
    increase of 17.5% over 2006. Sales from products introduced in
    the last three years increased $24.4 million or 6.6% in
    2007 to $391.3 million.

•

In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility,
    increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million
    to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that
    permits the Company to request up to an additional
    $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time
    during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain
    conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility
    from October 2011 to June 2012. At December 31, 2007, the
    Company had $525.3 million available under its revolving
    credit facility, including the $100 million accordion
    feature.

•

In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private
    placement to sell $450 million in senior notes to a group
    of institutional investors. There are two funding dates for the
    senior notes. The first funding occurred in December 2007 for
    $370 million, consisting of $270 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due December 2017
    and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second funding
    date will be in July 2008 for $80 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018.

Results
    of Operations

In 2007, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
    income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow from
    operations. The Company achieved these results from strong
    internal growth in both its EIG and EMG groups, as well as
    contributions from acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Operating
    income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued
    focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational
    Excellence initiatives. Based on strength in the Company’s
    long-cycle businesses, our global customer base, the full-year
    impact of 2007 acquisitions, and our Operational Excellence
    capabilities, the Company expects continued strength in
    operating results in 2008.

The Company reported sales for 2007 of $2,136.9 million, an
    increase of $317.6 million or 17.5% from sales of
    $1,819.3 million in 2006. Net sales for EIG were
    $1,199.8 million in 2007, an increase of 18.0% from sales
    of $1,016.5 million in 2006. Net sales for EMG were
    $937.1 million in 2007, an increase of 16.7% from sales of
    $802.8 million in 2006. The Company’s internal sales
    growth was approximately 7% in 2007, which excludes a 2%
    favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by
    strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions
    mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales
    increase.

Total international sales for 2007 increased to
    $1,053.7 million and represented 49.3% of consolidated
    sales, an increase of $187.7 million, or 21.7% when
    compared with international sales of $866.0 million or
    47.6% of consolidated sales in 2006. The increase in
    international sales resulted from increased international sales
    from base businesses of $74.9 million, or 39.9% of the
    increase, which includes the effect of foreign currency
    translation. The recent acquisitions of Cameca, SCP, Hamilton
    and Umeco in 2007 and Land Instruments, Pittman, Precitech and
    Southern Aeroparts in 2006 contributed the remainder of the
    increase. Increased international sales came mainly from sales
    to Europe by both reportable groups. Export shipments from the
    United States, which are included in total international sales,
    were $394.4 million in 2007, an increase of
    $50.6 million or 14.7% compared with $343.8 million in
    2006. Export shipments improved primarily due to increased
    exports from the base businesses and acquisitions noted above.

New orders for 2007 were $2,288.3 million, compared with
    $1,915.4 million for 2006, an increase of
    $372.9 million or 19.5%. The increase in orders was driven
    by the Company’s base differentiated businesses, which
    contributed $167.2 million, or 44.8% of the increase, led
    by the Company’s aerospace and engineered materials,
    interconnects and packaging businesses. The recent acquisitions
    mentioned above contributed the remainder of the increase. As a
    result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at
    December 31, 2007 was $688.2 million, compared with
    $536.8 million at December 31, 2006, which is an
    increase of $151.4 million or 28.2%. The increase in
    backlog was due to higher order levels in base differentiated
    businesses and the 2007 acquisitions, noted above.

Segment operating income was $427.5 million for 2007, an
    increase of $84.1 million, or 24.5%, compared with segment
    operating income of $343.4 million for 2006. Segment
    operating margins in 2007 were 20.0% of sales, an increase from
    18.9% of sales in 2006. The increase in segment operating income
    resulted from strength in the differentiated businesses of each
    group, which includes the profit contributions made by the
    acquisitions. The margin improvement came from the
    Company’s differentiated businesses.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were
    $263.5 million in 2007, compared with $219.5 million
    in 2006, an increase of $44.0 million or 20.1%. As a
    percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were higher in 2007 at
    12.3% of sales compared to 12.1% of sales in 2006. Selling
    expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 10.4% in 2007, slightly
    higher than the 10.2% in 2006. The selling expense increase and
    the corresponding increase in selling expenses as a percentage
    of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions. The
    Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire
    differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution
    channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher
    content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses
    increased 9.7% for 2007, compared to 2006, which was in line
    with internal sales growth including the impact of foreign
    currency translation.

Corporate administrative expenses were $40.8 million in
    2007, an increase of $6.6 million or 19.4%, when compared
    with 2006. The increase in corporate expenses is the result of
    higher compensation, including equity-based compensation
    associated with accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants
    in 2007 and other costs necessary


to grow the Company. As a percentage of sales, corporate
    administrative expenses were 1.9% in both 2007 and 2006.

Consolidated operating income was $386.6 million in 2007,
    an increase of $77.6 million or 25.1% when compared with
    $309.0 million in 2006. This represents an operating margin
    of 18.1% of sales for 2007 compared with 17.0% of sales in 2006.

Interest expense was $46.9 million in 2007, an increase of
    11.1% compared with $42.2 million in 2006. The increase was
    due to higher average borrowings to fund the 2007 acquisitions,
    higher average interest rates and the impact of the initial
    funding of the private placement senior notes.

The effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.2% compared with 31.0% in
    2006. The 2007 effective tax rate primarily reflects the
    elimination of the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial
    Income (FSC/ETI) tax benefit in 2007, an increase in state
    income taxes, and an increase in interest and penalties on
    uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an enacted decrease
    in certain foreign corporate tax rates in the second half of
    2007 and the recognition of tax benefits from our international
    tax planning initiatives. The 2006 effective tax rate benefited
    primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign
    tax credit carry forwards of $3.2 million, offset somewhat
    by higher nondeductible equity-based compensation.

Net income for 2007 was $228.0 million, an increase of
    $46.1 million, or 25.3% from $181.9 million in 2006.
    Diluted earnings per share increased 24.0% to $2.12 per share,
    an increase of $0.41 when compared with $1.71 per diluted share
    in 2006.

Operating
    Segment Results

EIG’s

sales were $1,199.8 million in 2007, an
    increase of $183.3 million or 18.0% from 2006 sales of
    $1,016.5 million. The sales increase was primarily due to
    internal growth of approximately 9%, excluding a favorable 2%
    effect of foreign currency translation. The internal growth was
    driven by sales increases in EIG’s process and analytical,
    aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of Cameca, Land
    Instruments, Precitech, Advanced and B&S accounted for the
    remainder of the sales increase.

EIG’s operating income for 2007 increased to
    $260.3 million from $203.4 million in 2006, an
    increase of $56.9 million, or 28.0%. Operating margins of
    EIG were 21.7% of sales for 2007 compared with operating margins
    of 20.0% of sales in 2006. The increase in segment operating
    income and margins came from the Group’s base
    differentiated businesses, which include the acquisitions
    mentioned above.

EMG’s

sales for 2007 were $937.1 million, an
    increase of $134.3 million or 16.7%, compared with sales of
    $802.8 million in 2006. The sales increase was due in part
    to internal growth, particularly in EMG’s differentiated
    businesses, which accounted for approximately 6%, excluding a
    favorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation. The
    acquisitions of Pittman, Southern Aeroparts, SCP, Umeco and
    Hamilton accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.

EMG’s operating income for 2007 increased to
    $167.2 million from $139.9 million in 2006, an
    increase of $27.3 million or 19.5%. The operating income
    increase was due to strength in the Group’s differentiated
    businesses, which includes the recent acquisitions mentioned
    above. EMG’s operating margins were 17.8% of sales in 2007
    compared with 17.4% of sales in 2006. The increase in operating
    margin was primarily due to an increased contribution from the
    Group’s differentiated businesses.

Results
    of Operations

In 2006, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
    income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow from
    operations. The Company achieved these results from strong
    internal growth in both its EIG and EMG groups, as well as
    contributions from acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Operating
    income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued
    focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational
    Excellence initiatives.


The Company reported sales for 2006 of $1,819.3 million, an
    increase of $384.8 million or 26.8% from sales of
    $1,434.5 million in 2005. Net sales for EIG were
    $1,016.5 million in 2006, an increase of 25.7% from sales
    of $808.5 million in 2005. EIG’s internal sales growth
    was 9% in 2006, driven by strength in its process, aerospace and
    power businesses. The acquisitions of SPECTRO in June 2005,
    Solartron in September 2005, Pulsar in February 2006 and Land
    Instruments in June 2006 also contributed to the sales growth.
    Net sales for EMG were $802.8 million in 2006, an increase
    of 28.2% from sales of $626.0 million in 2005. EMG’s
    internal sales growth was also 9% in 2006 driven by the
    group’s differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of HCC
    in October 2005 and Pittman in May 2006 also contributed to the
    sales growth.

Total international sales for 2006 increased to
    $866.0 million and represented 47.6% of consolidated sales,
    an increase of $210.1 million, or 32.0% when compared with
    international sales of $655.9 million or 45.7% of
    consolidated sales in 2005. The increase in international sales
    resulted from the acquisitions of SPECTRO, Solartron and HCC in
    2005 and the Land Instruments acquisition in 2006, as well as
    increased international sales from base businesses. Increased
    international sales came mainly from sales to Asia and Europe by
    both reportable groups. Export shipments from the United States,
    which are included in total international sales, were
    $343.8 million in 2006, an increase of $76.5 million
    or 28.6% compared with $267.3 million in 2005. Export
    shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from base
    businesses.

New orders for 2006 were $1,915.4 million, compared with
    $1,534.3 million for 2005, an increase of
    $381.1 million or 24.8%. The increase in orders was driven
    by demand in the Company’s differentiated businesses, led
    by the Company’s process businesses as well as the
    acquisitions mentioned above. The order backlog at
    December 31, 2006 was $536.8 million, compared with
    $440.7 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of
    $96.1 million or 21.8%. The increase in backlog was due to
    higher order levels in base differentiated businesses as well as
    the 2006 acquisitions.

Segment operating income was $343.4 million for 2006, an
    increase of $79.9 million, or 30.3%, compared with segment
    operating income of $263.5 million for 2005. Segment
    operating margins in 2006 were 18.9% of sales, an increase from
    18.4% of sales in 2005. The increase in segment operating income
    resulted from strength in the differentiated businesses of each
    group, which includes the profit contributions made by the
    acquisitions. The margin improvement came from the
    Company’s differentiated businesses.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were
    $219.5 million in 2006, compared with $174.2 million
    in 2005, an increase of $45.2 million or 26.0%. However, as
    a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses in 2006 were flat with
    2005 at 12.1% of sales. Selling expenses, as a percentage of
    sales, were 10.2% in 2006, essentially unchanged from 2005. Most
    of the increase in selling expenses was due to the acquired
    businesses. The Company’s acquisition strategy generally is
    to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their
    distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a
    higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling
    expenses increased 4.9% which is significantly lower than the
    Company’s 9% internal sales growth rate for 2006.

Corporate administrative expenses were $34.2 million in
    2006, an increase of $4.5 million or 15.3%, when compared
    with 2005. The increase in corporate expenses is the result of
    higher compensation costs, including equity-based compensation.
    As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were
    1.9% in 2006, a decline from 2.1% of sales in 2005.

Consolidated operating income was $309.0 million in 2006,
    an increase of $75.5 million or 32.3% when compared with
    $233.5 million in 2005. This represents an operating margin
    of 17.0% of sales for 2006 compared with 16.3% of sales in 2005.

Interest expense was $42.2 million in 2006, an increase of
    28.1% compared with $32.9 million in 2005. The increase was
    due to higher average borrowings necessary to fund the 2005 and
    2006 acquisitions, primarily related to the euro long-term debt
    incurred for the 2005 acquisition of SPECTRO and short-term debt
    incurred for the late 2005 acquisition of HCC.

The effective tax rate for 2006 was 31.0% compared with 31.2% in
    2005. The 2006 effective tax rate benefited primarily from the
    reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit
    carryforwards of $3.2 million, offset somewhat by higher
    nondeductible equity-based compensation. The 2006 and 2005
    effective tax rates benefited


from the realization of tax benefits stemming from the
    Company’s worldwide tax planning activities and other
    adjustments.

Net income for 2006 was $181.9 million, an increase of
    $45.5 million, or 33.4% from $136.4 million in 2005.
    Diluted earnings per share increased 32.6% to $1.71 per share,
    an increase of $0.42 when compared with $1.29 per diluted share
    in 2005.

Operating
    Segment Results

EIG’s

sales were $1,016.5 million in 2006, an
    increase of $208.0 million or 25.7% from 2005 sales of
    $808.5 million. The sales increase was due to internal
    growth in EIG’s process, aerospace and power businesses,
    and the acquisitions of SPECTRO and Solartron in 2005 and Pulsar
    and Land Instruments in 2006. Included in the 25.7% increase in
    sales is internal growth of approximately 9%. The acquisitions
    accounted for the remainder of the sales increase. The foreign
    currency translation effect on sales for 2006 was nominal.

EIG’s operating income for 2006 increased to
    $203.4 million from $164.2 million in 2005, an
    increase of $39.2 million, or 23.9%. The increase in
    operating income was driven by the higher sales, which includes
    the acquisitions. Operating margins of EIG were 20.0% of sales
    for 2006 compared with operating margins of 20.3% of sales in
    2005. The decrease in operating margins was due to the inclusion
    of a $4.3 million gain from the sale of a facility in 2005.

EMG’s

sales for 2006 were $802.8 million, an
    increase of $176.8 million or 28.2%, compared with sales of
    $626.0 million in 2005. The sales increase was due in part
    to internal growth, particularly in EMG’s differentiated
    businesses, which accounted for approximately 9% of the 28.2%
    sales increase. The acquisitions of HCC in October 2005 and
    Pittman in May 2006 accounted for the remainder of the sales
    increase. The foreign currency translation effect on sales for
    2006 was nominal.

EMG’s operating income for 2006 increased to
    $139.9 million from $99.2 million in 2005, an increase
    of $40.7 million or 41.0%. The operating income increase
    was significantly due to higher sales from the Group’s
    differentiated businesses, which includes the acquisitions
    mentioned above. EMG’s operating margins were 17.4% of
    sales in 2006 compared with operating margins of 15.9% of sales
    in 2005. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to a
    higher profit yield on the sales contribution of EMG’s
    differentiated businesses.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $278.5 million for 2007, compared with $226.0 million
    in 2006, an increase of $52.5 million, or 23.2%. The
    increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of
    higher earnings and lower pension contributions, partially
    offset by higher overall operating working capital investments
    necessary to grow the business. In 2007, the Company contributed
    $5.2 million to its defined benefit pension plans compared
    to $13.7 million contributed in 2006. Free cash flow
    (operating cash flow less capital spending) was
    $240.9 million in 2007, compared to $196.8 million in
    2006. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes,
    depreciation and amortization) was $433.9 million in 2007,
    compared with $351.4 million in 2006, a 23.5% improvement.
    Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is
    aware that there are measures that are used by third parties in
    evaluating the Company. (See table on page 20 for a
    reconciliation of generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).

Cash used for investing activities was $334.7 million for
    2007, compared with $206.0 million in 2006. In 2007, the
    Company paid $300.6 million for seven businesses and one
    technology line, net of cash received and also assumed
    $24.9 million of debt and long-term liabilities. In 2006,
    the Company paid $177.6 million for five acquisitions and
    two small technology lines, net of cash received. Additions to
    property, plant and equipment totaled $37.6 million in
    2007, compared with $29.2 million in 2006.

Cash provided from financing activities totaled
    $174.1 million in 2007, compared with cash used of
    $10.0 million in 2006. In 2007, total borrowings, net of
    repayments, increased by $180.9 million, compared with a
    net increase of $15.4 million in 2006. Short-term
    borrowings decreased $162.6 million in 2007, compared with
    an increase of $4.0 million in 2006. Long-term borrowings
    increased $343.4 million in 2007, compared to an increase
    of $11.3 million in 2006.


In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility,
    increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million
    to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that
    permits the Company to request up to an additional
    $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time
    during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain
    conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility
    from October 2011 to June 2012. At December 31, 2007, the
    Company had $525.3 million available under its revolving
    credit facility, including the $100 million accordion
    feature.

The accounts receivable securitization facility was amended and
    restated in May 2007 to increase the Company’s available
    borrowing capacity from $75 million to $110 million as
    well as extend the expiration date from May 2007 to May 2008.
    There were no borrowings under this facility at
    December 31, 2007.

In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $450 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There are two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in December
    2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due
    December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second
    funding date will be in July 2008 for $80 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July
    2018. The Notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of
    approximately 6.25%. The proceeds from the first funding of the
    notes were used to pay down the Company’s revolving credit
    facility, which included a foreign portion related to the 2007
    acquisition of Cameca SAS and the 2006 acquisition of Land
    Instruments, as well as borrowings outstanding under the
    Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.
    Additionally, the proceeds from the private placement were used
    to purchase California Instruments in December 2007. The
    residual cash balance ($86.6 million) at year-end 2007 is
    invested in short-term cash equivalent money market funds. The
    Company has a $225 million 7.20% senior note due July
    2008. It is the Company’s current intention to repay the
    7.20% senior note in July 2008 with the remaining proceeds
    from the $450 million private placement and borrowings
    under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

At December 31, 2007, total debt outstanding was
    $903.0 million compared with $681.9 million at
    December 31, 2006. The total debt-to-capital ratio was
    42.1% at December 31, 2007, compared with 41.4% at
    December 31, 2006. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total
    debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net
    debt and stockholders’ equity) was 37.1% at
    December 31, 2007, compared with 39.6% at December 31,
    2006. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the
    Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in
    evaluating the Company. (See page 20 for reconciliation of
    GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).

In 2007, net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock
    options were $17.2 million, compared with $9.9 million
    in 2006. Cash dividends paid were $25.7 million in 2007 and
    $18.8 million in 2006. The increase in dividends paid was a
    result of a Board of Directors-approved 50% increase in the
    quarterly dividend rate on the Company’s common stock in
    the fourth quarter of 2006.

In 2007, the Company used cash of $5.4 million for the
    repurchase of 144,000 shares of its common stock. In 2006,
    the Company used cash of $21.1 million for the repurchase
    of 750,000 shares of its common stock. As of
    December 31, 2007, $25.9 million was available, under
    the then current Board authorization, for future share
    repurchases. On January 24, 2008, the Board of Directors
    authorized an increase of $50 million in the authorization
    for the repurchase of its common stock. This increase will be
    added to the $25.9 million that remained available from an
    existing $50 million authorization approved in March 2003,
    for a total of $75.9 million available for repurchases of
    the Company’s common stock. Subsequent to December 31,
    2007, the Company has repurchased an additional
    1,000,057 shares of its common stock for approximately
    $43.5 million. Therefore, the remaining balance available
    for repurchases of the Company’s common stock is
    $32.4 million as of the filing of this report.


The following table summarizes AMETEK’s contractual cash
    obligations at December 31, 2007, and the effect such
    obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity
    and cash flows in future years.

Other
    Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of
    approximately $26.3 million related to performance and
    payment guarantees at December 31, 2007. Based on
    experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that
    any obligations that may arise will not be material to its
    financial position.

The Company may, from time to time, redeem, tender for, or
    repurchase its long-term debt in the open market or in privately
    negotiated transactions depending upon availability, market
    conditions and other factors.

As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in
    2007, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007
    totaled $170.1 million, compared with $49.1 million at
    December 31, 2006. The Company believes it has sufficient
    cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted
    foreign sources, available credit facilities, and access to
    long-term capital funds to enable it to meet operating needs and
    contractual commitments in the foreseeable future.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as
    those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on
    the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations, and that require the use of complex and
    subjective estimates based upon past experience and
    management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent
    in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the
    estimates used. The consolidated


financial statements and related notes contain information that
    is pertinent to the Company’s accounting policies and to
    management’s discussion and analysis. The information that
    follows represents additional specific disclosures about the
    Company’s accounting policies regarding risks, estimates,
    subjective decisions, or assessments whereby materially
    different results of operations and financial condition could
    have been reported had different assumptions been used or
    different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the
    Company’s significant accounting policies is in Note 1
    of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,”
    included elsewhere in this report.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is
    complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the
    customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under
    which title and risk of loss have been transferred,
    collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or
    determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and
    risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue
    upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for
    revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect to sales
    returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may
    not return products or be given allowances, except at the
    Company’s option. We have agreements with distributors that
    do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products.
    The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which
    time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The
    Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits
    to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company
    accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when
    the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other
    allowances, and estimated warranty costs are provided at the
    time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the accrual for future
    warranty obligations was $14.4 million, $10.9 million
    and $9.4 million, respectively. The Company’s expense
    for warranty obligations approximated $11.3 million,
    $7.6 million and $7.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely
    among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do
    not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense
    provision based on past warranty experience, and adjustments are
    made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual
    future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are
    higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains
    allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
    specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the
    Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against
    the amount due from these customers. For all other customers,
    the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the
    length of time specific receivables are past due based on its
    historical experience. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their
    inability to make payments, additional allowances may be
    required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $6.4 million and $7.4 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates
    current replacement cost, for approximately 62% of its
    inventories. The

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost
    for the remaining 38% of its inventory. For inventories where
    cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have
    been approximately $35.6 million and $34.1 million
    higher than the LIFO value reported in the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company
    provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and
    obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future
    demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing
    financial difficulties, and related management initiatives. If
    these factors are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets.

The
    Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Under
    SFAS 142, purchased goodwill and other intangible assets
    with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are
    not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least
    annually. These impairment tests include the projection and
    discounting of cash flows, estimates of future operating
    performance of the reporting unit being valued and estimates of
    the fair value of the intangible assets being tested.
    SFAS 142 requires a two-step impairment test for goodwill.
    The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit’s net assets to the fair value of the
    reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no
    further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is
    recognized. If the


carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step
    must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of
    the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess
    being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount
    of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The
    Company would be required to record such impairment losses.
    Indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill are tested by
    estimating the fair values of those assets as of the
    Company’s measurement date, with such fair values based on
    expected future operating performance and discount rates
    determined by management. Changes in interest rates and market
    conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these
    estimates. These estimates will likely change over time. The
    Company’s acquisitions have generally included a large
    goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make
    acquisitions. At December 31, 2007, goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled
    $1,358.1 million, or 49.4% of the Company’s total
    assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment
    test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that the
    Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were
    not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or
    indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the
    future.

•

Pensions.

The Company has U.S. and
    foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
    AMETEK accounts for all of its defined benefit pension plans in
    accordance with SFAS 87,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions

, and SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(SFAS 158), for balance sheet recognition of the
    overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement
    benefit plans, as well as the income statement recognition of
    the costs related to these plans. SFAS 87 and SFAS 158
    require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be
    determined on an actuarial basis. The most significant elements
    in determining the Company’s pension income or expense are
    the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected
    return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the
    current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be
    settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the
    Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to
    discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2007, the
    Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income
    investments. The discount rate used in determining the 2007
    pension cost was 5.9% for U.S. defined benefit pension
    plans and 5.0% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for
    determining the funded status of the plans at December 31,
    2007, and determining the 2008 defined benefit pension cost is
    6.25% for U.S. plans and 5.89% for foreign plans. In
    estimating the U.S. discount rate, the Company’s
    actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to
    the Plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on yields
    derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent
    maturity dates. In estimating the foreign plans discount rate,
    the Company looks to rates of return on high-quality,
    fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the
    projected benefit cash flows of the foreign plans. The Company
    used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for
    2007 of 8.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and
    7.00% for foreign plans. We will continue to use these rates for
    2008 for the U.S. and foreign plans, respectively. The
    Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based
    primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension
    plans’ investments. Additionally, the Company considers
    historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and
    equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed
    appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in
    determining the 2007 pension expense for the U.S. plans was
    3.75% and will remain unchanged in 2008. For foreign plans, the
    rate of compensation increase will be increased from 3.61% in
    2007 to 3.86% in 2008. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, the Company recognized consolidated pretax pension income
    of $3.8 million from its U.S. and foreign defined
    benefit pension plans. This compares with pretax pension expense
    of $2.5 million recognized for these plans in 2006, which
    included $0.8 million for pension curtailments.

The Company follows the balance sheet recognition requirements
    of SFAS 158. Under SFAS 158, all unrecognized prior service
    costs, remaining transition obligations or assets, and actuarial
    gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a
    charge to accumulated other comprehensive income
    (“AOCI”) in stockholders’ equity and will be
    amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. In
    addition, effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, the measurement date (the date at which
    plan assets and benefit obligation are measured) is required to
    be the Company’s fiscal year-end. The Company uses a
    December 31 measurement date for all of our U.S. defined
    benefit plans, and as required by SFAS 158,


will adopt a December 31 measurement date for our foreign plans
    in 2008, changing from the October 1 measurement date currently
    used for such plans.

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its
    defined benefit pension plans during 2007 which totaled
    $5.2 million, compared with $13.7 million in 2006. The
    Company anticipates making cash contributions to its defined
    benefit pension plans in 2008 at a level similar to those made
    in 2007.

•

Income Taxes.

The process of providing for
    income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts
    requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments
    regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. We conduct a broad
    range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex
    tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions,
    resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential
    litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must
    make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine
    estimates of our tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the
    final outcome differs, future adjustments to our tax assets and
    liabilities may be necessary.

We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, taking
    into consideration our forecast of future taxable income,
    available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax
    planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the
    deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, we must evaluate
    the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against
    our deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances
    change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances
    may be required.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes

. In accordance with FIN 48, we are required to assess
    the uncertainty in our tax positions, by applying a minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once
    the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not
    standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each
    item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax
    benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable
    outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full
    disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying
    probabilities are determined based on the best available
    objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published
    guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome
    of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that
    these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous
    changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice.

As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the company
    recognized a $4.7 million increase in liabilities
    associated with unrecognized tax benefits (UTB), including
    interest and penalties of $2.4 million and a decrease of
    $1.2 million in goodwill related to a previous business
    combination, and a $5.9 million charge to the
    January 1, 2007 opening balance of retained earnings.

Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 creates a single
    model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions, by
    prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
    required to meet before being recognized in the financial
    statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
    in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative
    effect of adopting FIN 48 resulted in a noncash reduction
    of $5.9 million to the January 1, 2007 opening balance
    of retained earnings (See Note 10).

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 06-5,

Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance —
    Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with
    FASB Technical

Bulletin No. 85-4

(“EITF 06-5”).

EITF 06-5

provides guidance in determining the amount to be realized under
    certain insurance contracts and the related disclosures.
    Adoption of

EITF 06-5

did not have any effect on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157,

Fair
    Value Measurements

. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under


other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair
    value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair
    value measurements and is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
    In February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position

No. 157-2,

which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non
    financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not
    currently recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring
    basis until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS 157 on our consolidated results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(“SFAS 159”) which is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This
    statement permits an entity to elect to measure certain assets
    and liabilities at fair value at specified election dates. The
    Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have an
    effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”). This
    statement significantly changes the financial accounting and
    reporting of business combination transactions in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008 and prohibits early adoption. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141R on our
    consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash
    flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). This statement significantly
    changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling
    (minority) interests in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early
    adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    adopting SFAS 160 on our consolidated results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

Internal
    Reinvestment

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $37.6 million or 1.8% of sales in
    2007, compared with $29.2 million, or 1.6% of sales in
    2006. Approximately 56% of the expenditures in 2007 were for
    improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to
    increase productivity and expand capacity. The Company’s
    2007 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis
    on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing
    capabilities. For 2008, capital expenditures are expected to
    approximate $48 million, with a continued emphasis on
    spending to improve productivity. The 2008 capital expenditures
    are expected to approximate 2% of sales.

Product
    Development and Engineering

Product development and engineering expenses are directed toward
    the development and improvement of new and existing products and
    processes. Such expenses before customer reimbursement were
    $102.9 million in 2007, an increase from $87.6 million
    in 2006, and $75.9 million in 2005. Customer reimbursements
    were $7.1 million, $6.4 million, and $8.9 million
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in the amounts
    above are net expenses for research and development of
    $52.9 million for 2007, $42.0 million for 2006, and
    $34.8 million for 2005.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
    existing at that time, at December 31, 2007 the Company is
    named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 15

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a
    “de minimis” party in 12 of these sites based on
    the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to
    the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 10 of these
    sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost
    of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is
    awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to
    settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other two sites,
    the


Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged
    volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties
    primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to
    establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the three
    remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the
    Company is participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
    issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
    this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites,
    the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
    probable remediation activities at certain of its current or
    previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned”
    sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with
    respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established
    once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
    estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through
    the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
    feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
    instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for
    such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
    the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of
    remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current
    estimates, and the amounts accrued in the financial statements;
    however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to
    result in a material change to the financial statements. In
    estimating our liability for remediation, we also consider our
    likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation
    expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their
    obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    were $25.3 million and $28.7 million, respectively for
    non-owned and owned sites. In 2007, the Company provided
    $1.5 million of additional reserves for environmental
    liabilities. The Company’s reserves for environmental
    liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 include reserves
    of $18.0 million and $21.2 million, respectively, for
    an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005
    acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is
    solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one
    of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in
    the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has
    obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from
    the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required
    remedial activities. At December 31, 2007, the Company has
    $12.6 million in receivables related to HCC for probable
    recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
    third-party funds to support the required remediation. In
    addition, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners
    for up to $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company also has agreements with other former owners of
    certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
    previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements,
    the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to
    indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other
    liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
    these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some
    environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their
    obligations in all material respects; however, one of these
    companies recently filed for bankruptcy liquidation. AMETEK has
    established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known
    responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The
    Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would
    fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion
    of management, based upon presently available information and
    past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision
    for probable costs has been made, and the ultimate cost
    resulting from these actions is not expected to materially
    affect the consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Market
    Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are
    fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
    and commodity prices, which could impact its results of
    operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its
    exposure to these risks through its normal operating and
    financing activities. The Company’s differentiated and
    global business activities help to reduce the impact that any
    particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a
    whole.

The Company’s short-term debt carries variable interest
    rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates.
    These financial instruments are more fully described in the
    notes to the financial statements.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most
    significant exchange rate exposure are the euro, the British
    pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and the Mexican
    peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate


fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through
    the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial
    instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of
    translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into
    U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income,
    within stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transactions
    have not had a significant effect on the operating results
    reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated
    with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign
    currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure
    are raw material purchases of nickel, copper, steel and gold.
    Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally
    mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate
    product, and purchase order pricing arrangements, although
    forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those
    exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest
    rates, commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, our
    best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings,
    fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments, and cash
    flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ
    materially from the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain matters discussed in this

Form 10-K

are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995, which
    involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Company’s
    operations and business environment, and can be affected by
    inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and
    uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in
    determining the Company’s actual future results. The
    Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor”
    provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous
    important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future
    could cause, the Company’s actual results to differ
    materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
    statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not
    all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ from present expectations are set forth above
    and under

Item 1A.-Risk

Factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any
    forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
    information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by
    the securities laws to do so.

Management’s
    Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
    the consolidated financial statements and related information.
    The statements are prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently
    applied and include certain amounts based on management’s
    best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
    elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
    financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
    financial information, management maintains a system of internal
    accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
    program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
    division of responsibility and the application of written
    policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
    reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
    preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
    of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and
    presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however,
    there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
    system of internal controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
    Company’s activities according to the highest standards of
    personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
    characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
    all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
    Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
    other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
    Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
    firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
    that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
    report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
    of the Company for its 2008 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
    registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
    direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an
    opinion as to whether management’s financial statements
    present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s
    financial position and operating results. This report is
    included on page 38.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in the Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on the
    framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that
    evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, which appears on page 37.

February 27, 2008


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 27,
    2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
    stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 10, the Company adopted FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes,” effective January 1, 2007. Also, as
    discussed in Note 11, the Company adopted the balance sheet
    recognition and disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” as
    of December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis of
    Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
    operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
    (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the
    Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany
    transactions in the consolidation. The Company’s
    investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted
    for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not
    significant to the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
    reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
    Equivalents, Securities, and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
    less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of the Company’s
    equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those
    of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as
    “available for sale”, although the Company may hold
    fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income
    securities generally mature within four years. The aggregate
    market value of equity and fixed-income securities at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 was: 2007 —
    $17.9 million ($16.3 million amortized cost) and
    2006 — $16.9 million ($15.7 million
    amortized cost). The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such
    securities is recorded as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (in stockholders’ equity), and
    is not material. The Company had no other-than-temporary
    impairment losses in 2007 or 2006. Certain of the Company’s
    other investments, which are not significant, are accounted for
    by the equity method of accounting as discussed above.

Accounts
    Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
    from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
    obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
    receivables is recorded against the amount due from these
    customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
    reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
    specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The
    allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $6.4 million and $7.4 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 5.

Inventories

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates
    current replacement cost, for approximately 62% of its
    inventories. The

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost
    for the remaining 38% of our inventory. For inventories where
    cost is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO
    value over the LIFO value was approximately $35.6 million
    and $34.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves
    for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current
    assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers
    who may be experiencing financial difficulties, and related
    management initiatives.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
    for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
    lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies,
    and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
    incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
    principally on a straight-line basis over


AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of
    lives for depreciable assets is generally 3 to 10 years for
    machinery and equipment, 5 to 27 years for leasehold
    improvements and 25 to 50 years for buildings.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
    when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when
    products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of
    an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have
    been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of
    sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery,
    we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all
    other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy, with
    respect to sales returns and allowances, generally provides that
    the customer may not return products or be given allowances,
    except at the Company’s option. We have agreements with
    distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for
    unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the
    Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the
    distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
    incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume
    discounts. The Company accounts for these sales incentives as a
    reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the income
    statement. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances, and
    estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is
    recognized based upon past experience. At December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, the accrual for future warranty obligations
    was $14.4 million, $10.9 million and
    $9.4 million, respectively. The Company’s expense for
    warranty obligations approximated $11.3 million in 2007,
    $7.6 million in 2006 and $7.2 million in 2005. The
    warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the
    Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed
    one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision
    based on past warranty experience, and adjustments are made
    periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Research
    and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
    operations as incurred and during the past three years were:
    2007-$52.9 million, 2006-$42.0 million and
    2005-$34.8 million.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, and
    were: 2007 — $27.5 million, 2006 —
    $23.5 million, and 2005 — $20.0 million.

Earnings
    per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
    average number of common shares considered outstanding during
    the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share
    reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities
    (principally outstanding common stock options and restricted
    stock grants). The following table presents the number of shares
    used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted
    earnings per share:

Financial
    Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
    using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and
    their results of operations are translated using average
    exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of


AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other
    than their functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from
    those transactions are included in operating results for the
    year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
    instruments. Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into
    from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain
    inventory purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the
    Company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuation. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company was a party to certain
    foreign currency forward contracts, which were not significant.
    These forward contracts were acquired as a part of a 2007
    acquisition. The last of these forward contracts is expected to
    settle as of January 31, 2008. No forward contracts were
    outstanding at December 31, 2006. In instances where
    transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the
    gains and losses on those transactions are included in
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) within
    stockholders’ equity to the extent they are effective as
    hedges. The Company has designated certain
    foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of the net
    investment in certain foreign operations. These net investment
    hedges are the Company’s British-pound-denominated
    long-term debt and euro-denominated long-term debt, pertaining
    to certain European acquisitions whose functional currencies are
    either the British pound or the euro. These acquisitions were
    financed by foreign-currency-denominated borrowings under
    AMETEK’s revolving credit facility and were subsequently
    refinanced with long-term private placement debt. These
    borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each
    of the foreign subsidiaries on their respective dates of
    acquisition. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities,

permits hedging the foreign currency
    exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. In
    accordance with SFAS 133, on the respective dates of
    acquisition, the Company designated the British pound- and
    euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments
    to offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the net investment
    in the acquired business due to changes in the British pound and
    euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced
    by management’s documentation supporting the
    contemporaneous hedge designation on the acquisition dates. As
    required by SFAS 133, any gain or loss on the hedging
    instrument following hedge designation (the debt), is reported
    in AOCI in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the
    investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to
    measure hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, all net investment hedges were effective. At
    December 31, 2007, the translation gains on the net
    carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments
    exceeded the translation losses on the carrying value of the
    underlying debt and are included in AOCI. An evaluation of hedge
    effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis
    and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
    $203.2 million and $227.9 million, respectively, of
    British pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge
    against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in
    2006, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company had $73.0 million and $66.0 million of
    euro-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against
    the net investment in a foreign subsidiary acquired in 2005. As
    a result of these British pound- and euro-denominated loans
    being designated and effective as net investment hedges,
    approximately $9.6 million and $29.1 million of
    currency losses have been included in the foreign currency
    translation component of other comprehensive income at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    123R. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards
    made under its share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the
    financial statements over the requisite service period of the
    grants. See Note 8.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and other intangible
    assets in accordance with SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

. Under SFAS 142, purchased goodwill
    and intangible assets with indefinite

    Inc.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized;
    rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents are being
    amortized over useful lives of 4 to 20 years. Customer
    relationships are being amortized over a period of 2 to
    20 years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being
    amortized over a period of 13 to 20 years. The Company
    periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated
    useful lives of these intangible assets.

In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives for impairment under SFAS 142, a determination of the
    fair value of the Company’s reporting units and its other
    intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based
    upon, among other things, estimates of future operating
    performance. Changes in market conditions, among other factors,
    may have an impact on these estimates. The Company completed its
    required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2007,
    2006 and 2005 and determined that the carrying values of
    goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were
    not impaired.

Income
    Taxes

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48,

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, as of January 1, 2007.
    As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized a $4.7 million increase in liabilities
    associated with uncertain tax positions, including interest and
    penalties of $2.4 million, a decrease of $1.2 million
    in goodwill related to a previous business combination, and a
    $5.9 million charge to the January 1, 2007, opening
    balance of retained earnings. The Company recognizes interest
    and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in
    income tax expense.

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
    related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess
    uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
    estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
    world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous
    international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
    audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which
    is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about
    such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and
    liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future
    adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.

We also are required to assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets, taking into consideration our forecast of future
    taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and
    available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to
    realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment,
    management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation
    allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the extent facts
    and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the
    valuation allowances may be required.

Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 creates a single
    model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions, by
    prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
    required to meet before being recognized in the financial
    statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
    in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative
    effect of adopting FIN 48 resulted in a noncash reduction
    of $5.9 million to the January 1, 2007 opening balance
    of retained earnings (See Note 10).

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 06-5,

Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance- Determining the
    Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical

Bulletin No. 85-4

    results of operations, financial position or cash flows.


AMETEK,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157,

Fair
    Value Measurements

. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other
    accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements and is effective for financial statements issued
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In
    February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position

No. 157-2,

which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not
    currently recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring
    basis until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS 157 on our consolidated results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(“SFAS 159”) which is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This
    statement permits an entity to elect to measure certain assets
    and liabilities at fair value at specified election dates. The
    Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 will have
    an effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”). This
    statement significantly changes the financial accounting and
    reporting of business combination transactions in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008 and prohibits early adoption. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141R on our
    consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash
    flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). This statement significantly
    changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling
    (minority) interests in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early
    adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    adopting SFAS 160 on our consolidated results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

Acquisitions

The Company spent $300.6 million in cash, net of cash
    acquired and assumed $24.9 million in debt and other long
    term liabilities (including a capital lease obligation) for
    seven acquisitions and one small technology line. The
    acquisitions include Seacon Phoenix (“SCP”) in April
    2007, Advanced Industries, Inc. (“Advanced”), B&S
    Aircraft Parts and Accessories (“B&S”) and
    Hamilton Precision Metals (“Hamilton”) in June 2007,
    Cameca SAS (“Cameca”) in August 2007, the
    Repair & Overhaul Division of Umeco plc (“Umeco
    R&O”) in November 2007, and California Instruments
    Corporation (“California Instruments”) in December
    2007. SCP provides undersea electrical interconnect subsystems
    to the global submarine market. Advanced manufactures starter
    generators, brush and brushless motors, vane-axial centrifugal
    blowers for cabin ventilation, and linear actuators for the
    business jet, light jet, and helicopter markets. B&S
    provides third-party maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO)
    services, primarily for starter generators and hydraulic and
    fuel system components, for a variety of business aircraft and
    helicopter applications. Hamilton produces highly differentiated
    niche specialty metals used in medical implant devices and
    surgical instruments, electronic components and measurement
    devices for aerospace and other industrial markets. Cameca is a
    manufacturer of high-end elemental analysis systems used in
    advanced laboratory research, semiconductor and nanotechnology
    applications. Umeco R&O provides third-party MRO services
    for a variety of helicopters and commercial and regional
    aircraft throughout Europe. California Instruments is a leader
    in the niche market for programmable alternating current (AC)
    power sources used to test electrical and electronic products,
    with an especially strong position in the high-power segment.
    Advanced, B&S, Cameca, and California Instruments are part
    of the Company’s Electronic Instruments Group
    (“EIG”). SCP, Hamilton and Umeco R&O are

part of the Company’s Electromechanical Group
    (“EMG”). The seven businesses acquired have annualized
    sales of approximately $230 million.

The acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
    method in accordance with SFAS 141,

Business
    Combinations

. Accordingly, the operating results of the
    above acquisitions have been included in the Company’s
    consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.

The following table represents the tentative allocation of the
    aggregate purchase price for the net assets of the above 2007
    acquisitions based on their estimated fair value:

This amount includes $24.9 million in debt and other
    long-term liabilities.

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits
    the Company expects to realize from the acquisitions as follows:
    The SCP acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with the
    Company’s engineered materials, interconnects and packaging
    business and extends the Company’s reach into new defense
    markets. The Advanced acquisition complements the Company’s
    AMPHION product line of power management products for the
    aerospace industry and broadens our product offering in the
    power management subsystem market. The B&S acquisition
    further expands the Company’s position in the third-party
    aerospace MRO market. The Hamilton acquisition is a strategic
    fit with our engineered materials, interconnects and packaging
    business and has strong positions in growing specialty metals
    niche markets within the aerospace and other industrial markets.
    The Cameca acquisition broadens the Company’s technical
    capabilities in high-end elemental analysis systems used in
    advanced laboratory research, semiconductor and nanotechnology
    applications. The Umeco R&O acquisition broadens the
    Company’s presence in the European aerospace MRO market,
    greatly expanding the range of products and airframe platforms
    that the Company supports. The California Instruments
    acquisition broadens the scope of our Power Instruments
    business, which produces power quality monitoring and metering
    instrumentation, and further expands our presence in the
    attractive electronic test and measurement equipment market. The
    Company expects approximately $23.5 million of the goodwill
    recorded on the 2007 acquisitions will be deductible in future
    years for tax purposes.

The Company is in the process of completing third-party
    valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired,
    updating its assessment of an acquired contingent liability
    associated with a product liability claim pertaining to Cameca,
    as well as finalizing restructuring plans for certain
    acquisitions. Adjustments to the allocation of purchase price
    will be recorded within the purchase price allocation period of
    up to twelve months subsequent to the period of acquisition.
    Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price is subject to
    revision.

The valuations for the $81.7 million preliminarily assigned
    to other intangible assets, related to the 2007 acquisitions,
    are currently being finalized by third-party appraisers. In
    connection with the finalization of the 2006 acquisitions,
    $56.4 million was assigned to intangible assets, which
    consisted primarily of patents, technology, customer
    relationships and trade names with estimated lives ranging from
    five to 20 years.

In 2006, the Company spent $177.6 million, net of cash
    received, for five new businesses and two small technology
    lines. The businesses acquired included Pulsar Technologies,
    Inc. (“Pulsar”) in February 2006, PennEngineering
    Motion Technologies, Inc. (“Pittman”) in May 2006,
    Land Instruments International Limited (“Land

Maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31,
    2007 are as follows: $5.5 million in 2009;
    $121.6 million in 2010; $1.5 million in 2011;
    $3.6 million in 2012; $1.5 million in 2013; and
    $533.3 million in 2014 and thereafter.

In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $450 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There are two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in December
    2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due
    December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second
    funding date will be in July 2008 for $80 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July
    2018. The notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of
    approximately 6.25%. The proceeds from the first funding of the
    notes were used to pay down the Company’s revolving credit
    facility, which included a foreign portion related to the 2007
    acquisition of Cameca SAS and the 2006 acquisition of Land
    Instruments, as well as borrowings outstanding under the
    Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.
    Additionally, the proceeds from the private placement were used
    to purchase California Instruments in December 2007, with the
    remaining proceeds held in cash equivalent money market funds at
    December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2007, the Company has an outstanding
    12.3 million British pound ($24.3 million at
    December 31, 2007) 6.82% (London Interbank Offered
    Rate (LIBOR) plus .69%) floating-rate term loan with annual
    installment payments due through 2010. In September 2005, the
    Company issued a 50 million euro ($73.0 million at
    December 31, 2007) 3.94% senior note due 2015. In
    November 2004, the Company issued a 40 million British
    pound ($79.5 million at December 31,
    2007) 5.99% senior note due in 2016. In September
    2003, the Company issued a 50 million British pound
    ($99.3 million at December 31,
    2007) 5.96% senior note due in 2010.

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization facility
    agreement with a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary, and
    the special-purpose subsidiary has a receivables sale agreement
    with two banks, whereby it can sell to a third party up to
    $110.0 million of its trade accounts receivable on a
    revolving basis. The securitization facility is a financing
    vehicle utilized by the Company because it generally offers
    attractive rates relative to other


AMETEK,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financing sources. When borrowings are outstanding under the
    facility, all securitized accounts receivable and related debt
    are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The special-purpose subsidiary is the servicer of the accounts
    receivable under the securitization facility. The accounts
    receivable securitization facility was amended and restated in
    May 2007 to increase the Company’s available borrowing
    capacity from $75 million to $110 million as well as
    extend the expiration date from May 2007 to May 2008. The
    Company intends to renew the securitization facility on an
    annual basis. Interest rates on amounts drawn down are based on
    prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper plus a
    program fee. The Company also pays a commitment fee on any
    unused commitments under the securitization facility. The
    Company’s accounts receivable securitization is accounted
    for as a secured borrowing under SFAS 140,

Accounting
    for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
    Extinguishments of Liabilities.

At December 31, 2007 the Company had no borrowings
    outstanding on the accounts receivable securitization. At
    December 31, 2006, the securitized accounts receivable and
    the corresponding debt on the consolidated balance sheet was
    $75.0 million. Interest expense under this facility is not
    significant. The weighted average interest rate when borrowings
    were outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization
    during 2007 and 2006 was 5.7% and 5.4%, respectively.

In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility,
    increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million
    to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that
    permits the Company to request up to an additional
    $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time
    during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain
    conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility
    from October 2011 to June 2012.

Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit
    facility are either at LIBOR or Euribor plus a negotiated
    spread, or at the U.S. prime rate. At December 31,
    2007 the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the
    revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company had outstanding revolving credit loans of
    $96.7 million. The weighted average interest rate on the
    revolving credit facility for the periods ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 5.82% and 5.54%,
    respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of credit
    totaling $24.7 million and $27.2 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The revolving credit facility places certain restrictions on
    allowable additional indebtedness. At December 31, 2007 the
    Company had available borrowing capacity of $525.3 million
    under its $550 million revolving bank credit facility,
    which includes an accordion feature allowing $100 million
    of additional borrowing capacity.

The private placement, floating-rate term loan, the senior
    notes, the revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable
    securitization are subject to certain customary covenants,
    including financial covenants that, among other things, require
    the Company to maintain certain debt to EBITDA and interest
    coverage ratios.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
    facilities with local foreign lenders of approximately
    $81.9 million at December 31, 2007. Foreign
    subsidiaries had debt outstanding at December 31, 2007
    totaling $56.1 million, including $45.1 million
    reported in long-term debt.

The approximate weighted average interest rate on total debt
    outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 6.3%.

Stockholders’
    Equity

In 2007, the Company repurchased 144,000 shares of its
    common stock for $5.4 million in cash under its current
    share repurchase authorization. In 2006, the Company used cash
    of $21.1 million for the repurchase of 750,000 shares
    of its common stock. At December 31, 2007, approximately
    $25.9 million of the then current share repurchase
    authorization was unexpended. On January 24, 2008, the
    Board of Directors authorized an increase of $50 million in
    the authorization for the repurchase of its common stock. This
    increase will be added to the $25.9 million that remained
    available from an existing $50 million authorization
    approved in March 2003, for a

total of $75.9 million available for repurchases of the
    Company’s common stock. Subsequent to December 31,
    2007, the Company has repurchased an additional
    1,000,057 shares of its common stock for approximately
    $43.5 million. Therefore, the remaining balance available
    for repurchases of the Company’s common stock is
    $32.4 million as of the filing of this report. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company held approximately
    2.4 million shares in its treasury at a cost of
    $39.3 million, compared with approximately 2.4 million
    shares at a cost of $37.2 million at the end of 2006. The
    number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2007 was
    107.4 million shares, compared with 106.1 million
    shares at December 31, 2006.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
    Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one
    Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the close
    of business on June 2, 2007, and has authorized the
    issuance of one Right for each share of Common Stock of the
    Company issued between the Record Date and the Distribution
    Date. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving
    acquisition of the Company’s common stock, that holders of
    Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be entitled
    (i) to purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified
    exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares of common stock
    of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of
    twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the Plan
    expire in June 2017.

8.

Share-Based
    Compensation

Under the terms of the Company’s stockholder-approved
    share-based plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options and
    restricted stock awards have been, and may be, issued to the
    Company’s officers, management-level employees and members
    of its Board of Directors. In 2007, the Board of Directors and
    the Company’s stockholders approved the 2007 Omnibus
    Incentive Compensation Plan, which permits the issuance of up to
    3.5 million shares of Company common stock. Employee and
    nonemployee Director stock options generally vest at a rate of
    25% per year, beginning one year from the date of the grant and
    restricted stock awards generally have a four-year cliff
    vesting. Options primarily have a maximum contractual term of
    seven years. At December 31, 2007, 8.7 million shares
    of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the
    Company’s share-based plans, including 3.8 million
    shares for stock options outstanding.

The Company issues previously unissued shares when options are
    exercised, and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the
    award of restricted stock.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS 123R using the modified retrospective
    transition method. Among other things, SFAS 123R supersedes
    APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and
    requires companies to measure and record compensation expense
    related to all stock awards by recognizing the unamortized grant
    date fair value of the awards over their requisite service
    periods in the financial statements. For grants under any of the
    Company’s plans that are subject to graded vesting over a
    service period, the Company recognizes expense on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award.

Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is
    recognized in the financial statements as if the recognition
    provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, had been applied to all share-based payments
    granted subsequent to the original effective date of
    SFAS 123 (January 1, 1995). As such, operating results
    for periods prior to 2006 have been retrospectively adjusted
    utilizing the fair value of stock options originally determined
    for the purpose of providing the pro forma disclosures in the
    Company’s prior financial statements.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
    grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The
    following weighted average assumptions were used in the

    options granted during the years indicated:

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s stock. The Company used historical exercise data
    to estimate the options’ expected life, which represents
    the period of time that the options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Management anticipates that the future option
    holding periods will be similar to the historical option holding
    periods. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual
    life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
    curve at the time of grant. Compensation expense recognized for
    all share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The
    Company’s estimated forfeiture rates are based on its
    historical experience.

Expected future pretax compensation expense relating to the

    December 31, 2007 is $10.2 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    two years.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Company’s
    restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of the
    number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the
    Company’s common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock,
    the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation)
    at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of capital in
    excess of par value in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over
    the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived
    service period as determined on the grant date. Restricted stock
    awards are also subject to accelerated vesting due to certain
    events, including doubling of the grant price of the
    Company’s common stock as of the close of business during
    any five consecutive trading days. On February 20, 2007,
    July 9, 2007, and October 2, 2007 an aggregate of
    472,612 shares of restricted stock vested under the
    accelerated vesting provision. The charge to income due to the
    accelerated vesting of these shares did not have a material
    impact on our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007.

A summary of the status of the Company’s nonvested
    restricted stock outstanding as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 is presented below:

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) in 2007, the Company reserved
    15,207 shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements
    and terminations were 5,865 shares in 2007. The total
    number of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was
    255,115 as of December 31, 2007. Charges to expense under
    the SERP are not significant in amount, and are considered
    pension expense with the offsetting credit reflected in capital
    in excess of par value.

Leases
    and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases
    in effect at December 31, 2007 (principally for production
    and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to
    $76.8 million, consisting of payments of $14.3 million
    in 2008, $11.2 million in 2009, $8.5 million in 2010,
    $5.2 million in 2011, $4.6 million in 2012, and
    $33.0 million in 2013 and thereafter. Rental expense was
    $19.1 million in 2007, $15.2 million in 2006 and
    $14.5 million in 2005. The leases expire over a range of
    years from 2008 to 2040, with renewal or purchase options,
    subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of
    the leases.

The Company acquired a capital lease obligation in 2007 for land
    and a building. The lease has a term of twelve years, which
    began July 2006, and is payable quarterly. Property, plant and
    equipment as of December 31, 2007 includes a building of
    $15.1 million, net of $0.7 million of accumulated
    depreciation and land of $2.2 million. Amortization of the
    leased assets of $0.3 million is included in 2007
    depreciation expense. Future minimum lease payments are
    estimated to be $0.9 million in 2008, $0.9 million in
    2009, $1.0 million in 2010, $1.0 million in 2011,
    $1.1 million in 2012, and $11.1 million thereafter,
    for total minimum lease payments of $16.0 million, net of
    interest.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
    $189.2 million and $179.9 million, respectively, in
    purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of
    contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed
    prices.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company finalized its
    plans to reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign
    subsidiaries in future international expansion initiatives,
    therefore the Company reversed a previously recorded deferred
    tax liability of $2.4 million. As of December 31,
    2007, there is no provision for U.S. deferred income taxes
    for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which
    total approximately $152.8 million. If the company were to
    distribute those earnings to the United States, the Company
    would be subject to U.S. income taxes based on the excess
    of the U.S. statutory rate over statutory rates in the
    foreign jurisdiction and withholding taxes payable to the
    various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the
    unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these
    undistributed earnings is not practicable.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company has tax benefits of
    approximately $5.0 million related to net operating loss
    carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income
    taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations
    based on foreign and U.S. tax law. This amount includes net
    operating loss carryforwards of $4.0 million for federal
    income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of
    $3.7 million, and $1.0 million for state income tax
    purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.8 million. These
    net operating loss carryforwards if not used, will expire
    between 2010 and 2030. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
    has U.S. and foreign tax credit carry forwards of
    approximately $3.1 million which begin to expire in 2014.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain
    deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to
    be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred
    tax assets established for net operating loss carryforwards. Any
    reductions in the allowance resulting from the realization of
    the loss carryforwards of acquired companies will result in a
    reduction of goodwill. In 2007, the Company recorded a net
    reduction in goodwill of $1.6 million related to the
    utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.

As disclosed in Note 1, the Company adopted FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

on
    January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of
    FIN 48, the company recognized a $4.7 million increase
    in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits,
    including interest and penalties of $2.4 million, a
    decrease of $1.2 million in goodwill related to a previous
    business combination, and a $5.9 million charge to the
    January 1, 2007, opening balance of retained earnings.

After recognizing the impacts of adopting FIN 48, as of the
    adoption date, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits
    of $24.9 million of which $23.6 million, if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

Under FIN 48, the Company has elected to continue its prior
    practice of accounting for interest and penalties on uncertain
    tax positions as income tax. As a result, the Company has
    reported $3.0 million in the aggregate related to interest
    and penalty exposure as accrued income tax expense in the
    balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 and during 2007, the
    Company recognized $1.5 million of interest and penalties
    in the income statement.

The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the
    United States. The Company files income tax returns in various
    state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple
    legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open
    tax years subject to tax audit on average of between 3 to
    6 years in these jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS), is currently examining the Company’s
    U.S. income tax returns for

1999-2005.

The Company has not materially extended any other statutes of
    limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and
    accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods.
    Tax years in certain state and foreign jurisdictions remain
    subject to examination; however the uncertain tax positions
    related to these jurisdictions are not considered material. In
    addition to the IRS audit, the Company is also pursuing treaty
    clearance related to interest deductibility outside of the
    U.S. which, if received, could have a material impact on
    the tax expense during 2008. Unrecognized tax benefits in total
    related to the IRS audit and treaty clearances is
    $17.8 million at December 31, 2007. There can be no
    assurance that any portion of this will be favorably resolved.

During 2007, the Company added $1.9 million of tax,
    interest and penalties related to 2007 activity for identified
    uncertain tax positions and reversed $3.9 million of tax
    and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of
    prior uncertain positions.

Retirement
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement
    and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
    covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
    generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of
    service

and/or

compensation. The following is a brief description of the
    Company’s retirement and pension plans. The Company adopted
    the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS 158 as
    of December 31, 2006.

The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
    benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
    trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
    Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined
    benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
    based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
    of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. AMETEK estimates
    that it will make cash contributions of approximately
    $5 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans
    in 2008.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal
    year-end) for its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and an
    October 1 measurement date for its foreign defined benefit
    pension plans. Effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, SFAS 158 requires the measurement
    date to be the Company’s fiscal year-end for all defined
    benefit plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for
    eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the savings plan
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
    basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a
    dollar-for-dollar basis up to 6% of eligible compensation or a
    maximum of $1,200 per participant.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined
    contribution retirement feature principally to cover
    U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after
    December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
    Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
    pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary
    subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the
    Company’s foreign operations participate in various local
    defined contribution plans.

The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
    certain of its U.S. acquired businesses for the benefit of
    eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
    participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed 6% of
    the participant’s base compensation.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
    Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
    supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
    arrangements

and/or

a
    Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) covering certain
    current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental
    benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement
    benefits that would have been provided under the Company’s
    primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on
    compensation that must be taken into account under those plans.
    The projected benefit obligations of the SERP and the contracts
    will primarily be funded

Amounts in 2007 and 2006 include an approximate 10% investment
    in alternative assets consisting of hedge funds. Amounts in 2007
    and 2006 also include cash and cash equivalents.

The fair value of plan assets for U.S. plans was
    $418.3 million and $396.3 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The expected long-term rate of
    return on these plan assets was 8.25% in 2007 and 2006. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, equity securities included
    679,200 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market
    value of $31.8 million (7.6% of total plan investment
    assets) at December 31, 2007 and a market value of
    $21.6 million (5.5% of total plan investment assets) at
    December 31, 2006.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the plans’
    funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
    expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
    term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
    established. Since there may be periods of time where both
    equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an
    allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
    overall portfolio’s diversification and return potential.
    The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking
    into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
    streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
    actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
    established targets and ranges, and rebalanced when necessary.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
    style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
    component.

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets
    is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
    assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
    portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
    guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
    interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in
    note (a) above, certain investments are prohibited.
    Prohibited investments include venture capital, private
    placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading,
    commodities, limited partnerships, short selling, and rights and
    warrants. Foreign currency futures, options, and forward
    contracts may be used to manage foreign currency exposure.

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
    rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
    level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
    of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
    different asset classes, relative to the plans’ liabilities
    and how this can be affected by diversification, and the
    relative returns available on equities, fixed-income
    investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility
    of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are
    considered. It is expected that equities will outperform
    fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the
    trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may
    better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
    relatively young active employee group covered by the plans, and
    the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to
    adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward
    equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be
    reviewed from time to time in view of changes in market
    conditions and in the plans’ liability profile.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
    developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
    the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
    assets. This review also considered current capital market
    conditions and expectations of projected future investment
    returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
    category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
    The current low interest rate environment also influences this
    outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. and

Postretirement
    Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
    pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former
    employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and
    are not significant.

The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
    certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
    retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
    employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
    retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
    compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
    invested in either, or a combination of, (a) an
    interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
    the general assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of
    a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common
    stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
    plan, including income earned, was $10.7 million and
    $9.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by

Business
    Segment and Geographic Information

Descriptive
    Information about Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, EIG and EMG. The
    Company manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments
    for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
    type, production processes, distribution methods, and management
    organizations.

EIG produces instrumentation for various electronic applications
    used in transportation industries, including aircraft cockpit
    instruments and displays, airborne electronics systems that
    monitor and record flight and engine data, and pressure,
    temperature, flow and liquid-level sensors for commercial
    airlines and aircraft and jet engine manufacturers. EIG also
    produces analytical instrumentation for the laboratory and
    research markets, as well as instruments for food service
    equipment, measurement and monitoring instrumentation for
    various process industries and instruments and complete
    instrument panels for heavy trucks and heavy construction and
    agricultural vehicles. EIG also manufactures ultraprecise
    measurement instrumentation, as well as thermoplastic compounds
    for automotive, appliance, and telecommunications applications.

EMG produces brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass
    transit, medical equipment, computer and business machine
    applications. EMG also produces high-purity metal powders and
    alloys in powder, strip, and wire form for electronic
    components, aircraft and automotive products, as well as heat
    exchangers and thermal management subsystems. EMG also supplies
    hermetically sealed (moisture-proof) connectors, terminals and
    headers. These electromechanical devices are used in aerospace,
    defense and other industrial applications. Additionally, EMG
    produces air-moving electric motors and motor-blower systems for
    manufacturers of floor care appliances and outdoor power
    equipment. Sales of floor care and specialty motors represented
    13.7% in 2007, 15.6% in 2006 and 19.2% in 2005 of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales.

Measurement
    of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
    and expenses (including certain administrative and other
    expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include an
    allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
    reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and
    profits, which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are
    generally based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment
    assets include allocations directly related to the
    segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of
    investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits, and deferred
    taxes.

Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
    basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
    of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
    business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
    parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
    enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. The
    amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
    the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
    point in time. The maximum amount of future payment obligations
    relative to these various guarantees was approximately
    $108.1 million, and the outstanding liability under certain
    of those guarantees was approximately $29.7 million at
    December 31, 2007. These guarantees expire in 2008 through
    2010.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
    transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
    compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
    unfavorable financial consequences resulting from


AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations, or
    retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee
    liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not
    explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such
    indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount
    of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically
    stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
    indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
    Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims
    against them in connection with their positions with the
    Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims
    related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the
    Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any,
    under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a
    material impact on its results of operations, financial
    position, or cash flows.

Product
    Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
    sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
    vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the
    most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
    warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience,
    and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
    expenses.

Changes in the Company’s accrued product warranty
    obligation for 2007 and 2006 were as follows (in thousands):

Contingencies

Asbestos
    Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a
    defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of
    asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate
    to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not
    involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company,
    or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which
    are under new ownership. In connection with many of these
    lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the
    case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these
    claims (the “Indemnified Claims”). The Indemnified
    Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such
    sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met
    their obligations in all respects, and the Company does not have
    any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their
    obligations in the future. To date, no judgments have been
    rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related
    lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the
    claims being asserted, and intends to continue to vigorously
    defend itself in these matters.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in


AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

compliance with regulations existing at that time, at
    December 31, 2007 the Company is named a Potentially
    Responsible Party (PRP) at 15

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a
    “de minimis” party in 12 of these sites based on the
    low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the
    amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 10 of these sites,
    the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the
    de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting
    executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement
    amounts are fully reserved. In the other two sites, the Company
    is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
    attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
    responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an
    appropriate settlement amount. In the three remaining sites
    where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is
    participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
    issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
    this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites,
    the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
    probable remediation activities at certain of its current or
    previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned”
    sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with
    respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established
    once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
    estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through
    the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
    feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
    instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for
    such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
    the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of
    remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current
    estimates, and the amounts accrued in the financial statements;
    however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to
    result in a material change to the financial statements. In
    estimating our liability for remediation, we also consider our
    likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation
    expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their
    obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    were $25.3 million and $28.7 million, respectively for
    non-owned and owned sites. In 2007, the Company provided
    $1.5 million of additional reserves for environmental
    liabilities. The Company’s reserves for environmental
    liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 include reserves
    of $18.0 million and $21.2 million, respectively, for
    an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005
    acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is
    solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one
    of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in
    the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has
    obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from
    the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required
    remedial activities. At December 31, 2007, the Company has
    $12.6 million in receivables related to HCC for probable
    recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
    third-party funds to support the required remediation. In
    addition, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners
    for up to $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company also has agreements with other former owners of
    certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of
    previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements,
    the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to
    indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other
    liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
    these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some
    environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their
    obligations in all material respects; however, one of these
    companies recently filed for bankruptcy liquidation. AMETEK has
    established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known
    responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The
    Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would
    fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion
    of management, based upon presently available information and
    past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision
    for probable costs has been made, and the ultimate cost
    resulting from these actions is not expected to materially
    affect the consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Company.
