U.S. floorcare market from independent manufacturers. Competition is strong from Asian motor manufacturers that serve both the U.S. and the European floorcare markets. Global vacuum motor production is continually being shifted to Asia where AMETEK
has a smaller market position. There is potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers of floorcare products that produce their own motor-blowers. Many of these manufacturers would also be potential EMG customers if they decided to
outsource their motor production.

Backlog and Seasonal Variations of Business

The Company’s backlog of unfilled orders by business segment was as follows at December 31:

The higher backlog at December 31, 2011 was due to higher order levels and the
acquired backlog of 2011 acquisitions.

Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2011,
approximately 88% is expected to be shipped by December 31, 2012. The Company believes that neither its business as a whole, nor either of its reportable segments, is subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain individual
operations experience some seasonal variability.



Availability of Raw Materials

The Company’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources and generally from
more than one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes its sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate
for its needs.

At December 31, 2011, the Company employed approximately 12,200 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of
whom approximately 2,100 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company has two collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2012, which cover less than 100 employees. The Company expects no material adverse effects
from the pending labor contract negotiations.

Working Capital Practices

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital requirements in either of its reportable segments. Customers
generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled and maintained at levels related to production cycles and are responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motor markets
could adversely affect our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in
nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motor markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully
integrate recent and future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions
of strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2007, through December 31, 2011, we have completed 27 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings.
Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:

•

Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;

•

The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on
favorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;

•

Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controls
of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;

•

Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;

•

U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;

•

Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;

•

Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

•

Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating
difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the
acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may experience unanticipated start-up expenses
and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers.

Certain of our businesses
are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of our
existing facilities, could result in production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our business and operations.



Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with
international operations.

International sales for 2011 and 2010 represented 50.2% and 49.0% of our
consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. International operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in
an international environment, including:

•

Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;

•

Overlap of different tax structures;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subjecting
us to exchange rate exposures;

•

Restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

General economic conditions;

•

Unstable political situations;

•

Nationalization of assets; and

•

Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.

Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.

We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our
transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit
the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in
civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.

Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively
integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the
expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.

If we are unable
to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.

We
believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain



technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no
assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We
are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.

A shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs.

We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;
however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect
the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at
such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and
several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of
government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and
capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these
matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and
regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.

We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition,
existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such new
laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.

We may be
required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our
operations expose us to



potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a
significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be
adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We operate in highly competitive
industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as
with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are price, product technology, distribution, quality and service. EMG’s competition in specialty
metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by
EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or
changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of
our competitors.

Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur
additional indebtedness.

Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain
restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility.

We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.

We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit
facilities, financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its obligations
under such contracts.

Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of
such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $2,789.2
million or 65% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually
whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting
rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

Properties

At December 31, 2011, the Company had 114 operating facilities in 23 states and 16 foreign countries. Of these facilities, 55 are owned by the Company and 59 are leased. The properties owned by
the Company consist of approximately 677 acres, of which approximately 4.3 million square feet are under roof. Under lease is a total of approximately 1.8 million square feet. The leases expire over a range of years from 2011 to 2082,
with renewal options for varying terms contained in many of the leases. Production facilities in China, Taiwan and Japan provide the Company with additional production capacity through the Company’s investment in 50% or less owned joint
ventures. The Company’s executive offices in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, occupy approximately 43,000 square feet under a lease that expires in September 2023.

The Company’s machinery and equipment, plants and offices are in satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the uses to which they are put. The operating facilities of the Company by
business segment were as follows at December 31, 2011:

Legal Proceedings

Please refer to “Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding certain litigation matters.

In addition to those
litigation matters described above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business. These lawsuits may involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s
products and services, personal injury, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes and intellectual property matters. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Based upon the Company’s
experience, the Company does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read
in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Business Overview

As a global business, AMETEK’s operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Company’s strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of
products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2011, the Company established records for net
sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The impact of contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive
impact on 2011 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEK’s four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.
Highlights of 2011 were:

•

In 2011, net sales were $3.0 billion, an increase of $518.9 million or 21.0% from 2010, on internal growth of approximately 16% in the
Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and 6% in the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”) excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, and contributions from the 2010 and 2011 acquisitions.

•

Net income for 2011 was $384.5 million, an increase of $100.6 million or 35.4% when compared with $283.9 million in 2010.

•

During 2011, the Company completed the following acquisitions:

•

In April 2011, the Company acquired Avicenna Technology, Inc. (“Avicenna”), a supplier of custom, fine-featured components used in the
medical device industry.

•

In May 2011, the Company acquired Coining Holding Company (“Coining”), a leading supplier of custom-shaped metal preforms, microstampings
and bonding wire solutions for interconnect applications in microelectronics packaging and assembly.

•

In October 2011, the Company acquired Reichert Technologies, a manufacturer of analytical instruments and diagnostic devices for the eye care
market.

•

In October 2011, the Company acquired EM Test (Switzerland) GmbH, a manufacturer of advanced monitoring, testing, calibrating and display
instruments in the electrical immunity testing and emissions measurement markets.

•

In December 2011, the Company acquired Technical Manufacturing Corporation (“TMC”), a world leader in high-performance vibration isolation
systems and optical test benches used to isolate highly sensitive instruments for the microelectronics, life sciences, photonics and ultra-precision manufacturing industries.



•

Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow provided by operating activities that totaled $508.6 million for 2011, a $85.6 million or
20.2% increase from 2010.

•

The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales, were $1,501.1
million or 50.2% of net sales in 2011, compared with $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of net sales in 2010.

•

New orders for 2011 were $3,072.5 million, an increase of $421.2 million or 15.9% when compared with $2,651.3 million in 2010. As a
result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2011 was a year end record at $911.4 million.

•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $137.6 million in 2011 before customer
reimbursement of $6.1 million. Sales from products introduced in the last three years were $595.2 million or 19.9% of net sales.

•

In September 2011, AMETEK completed a new five-year revolving credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of $700 million, which excludes an
accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The new revolving credit facility
replaced a $450 million total borrowing capacity revolving credit facility, which excluded a $100 million accordion feature, that was due to expire in June 2012. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $742.7 million available under its revolving
credit facility, including the $200 million accordion feature.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company issued a 55 million Swiss franc ($59.0 million) 2.44% senior note due December 2021.

Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010

Results of Operations

In 2011, the Company established records for sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from
strong internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions completed in 2011 and the acquisitions of Technical Services for Electronics (“TSE”) in June 2010, Haydon Enterprises in July 2010 and Atlas Material
Testing Technology LLC (“Atlas”) in November 2010. The full year impact of the 2011 acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities should have a positive impact on our 2012 results.

Net sales for 2011 were $2,989.9 million, an increase of $518.9 million or 21.0% when compared with net sales of $2,471.0
million in 2010. Net sales for EIG were $1,647.2 million in 2011, an increase of 24.4% from net sales of $1,324.1 million in 2010. Net sales for EMG were $1,342.7 million in 2011, an increase of 17.1% from net sales of
$1,146.8 million in 2010. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2011 was driven by strong internal sales growth of
approximately 11%, which excludes a 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.

Total international sales for 2011 were $1,501.1 million or 50.2% of net sales, an increase of $289.8 million or
23.9% when compared with international sales of $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of net sales in 2010. The $289.8 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above, driven by continued strong expansion into Asia, as well
as growth in Europe, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain a strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in
total international sales, were $774.9 million in 2011, an increase of $210.4 million or 37.3% compared with $564.5 million in 2010. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from both the base businesses and the acquisitions
noted above.

New orders for 2011 were $3,072.5 million, an increase of $421.2 million or 15.9% when
compared with $2,651.3 million in 2010. For 2011, internal order growth was approximately 8%, excluding a 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by the differentiated businesses of both EIG and EMG, with the acquisitions
mentioned above accounting for the remainder of the increase. As a result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2011 was a year end record at $911.4 million, an increase of $82.6 million or 10.0% when compared with
$828.8 million at December 31, 2010.

Segment operating income for 2011 was $682.9 million, an
increase of $156.3 million or 29.7% when compared with segment operating income of $526.6 million in 2010. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 22.8% in 2011 from 21.3% in 2010. The increase in segment operating
income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from the leveraged impact of the Company’s net sales increase noted above, as well as the benefits of the Company’s lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for 2011 were $349.3 million, an increase
of $52.8 million or 17.8% when compared with $296.5 million in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.7% for 2011, compared with 12.0% in 2010. A portion of the increase in SG&A expenses was the result of a
$2.1 million charge recorded in corporate administrative expenses related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2009 restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2011. Selling expense increased $49.4 million or 19.5% for 2011 driven by
the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 10.1% for 2011, compared with 10.3% for 2010. Base business selling expense increased approximately 11.6% for 2011, which was in line with internal
sales growth.

Corporate administrative expenses for 2011 were $46.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or
8.1% when compared with $43.1 million in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.6%



for 2011, compared with 1.7% in 2010. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily the result of equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted
stock in the second quarter of 2011, noted above, as well as higher compensation related expenses.

Consolidated operating income was $635.9 million or 21.3% of net sales for 2011, an increase of $153.7 million or
31.9% when compared with $482.2 million or 19.5% of net sales in 2010.

Interest expense was $69.7 million for
2011, an increase of $2.2 million or 3.3% when compared with $67.5 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the issuance of an 80 million British pound senior note in the third quarter of 2010, partially
offset by the repayment of a 50 million British pound senior note in the third quarter of 2010.

Other
expenses, net were $9.6 million for 2011, an increase of $1.2 million when compared with $8.4 million in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by higher acquisition-related expenses and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency.

The effective tax rate for 2011 was 30.9% compared with 30.1% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 included the
impact of the accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock amortization. The effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 included the impact of international statutory tax rate reductions and benefits obtained from a favorable mix of
international taxable earnings. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

Net income for 2011 was $384.5 million, an increase of $100.6 million or 35.4% when compared with $283.9 million in
2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 were $2.37, an increase of $0.61 or 34.7% when compared with $1.76 per diluted share in 2010.

Segment Results

EIG’s

net sales totaled $1,647.2 million for 2011, an increase of $323.1 million or 24.4% when compared with $1,324.1 million in 2010. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of
approximately 16%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, and was driven primarily by increases in EIG’s process, power and industrial businesses. The acquisitions of EM Test, Reichert Technologies and Atlas accounted
for the remainder of the net sales increase.

EIG’s operating income was $420.2 million for 2011, an
increase of $104.0 million or 32.9% when compared with $316.2 million in 2010. EIG’s operating margins were 25.5% of net sales for 2011 compared with 23.9% of net sales in 2010. The increase in segment operating income and operating
margins was driven by the leveraged impact of the Group’s increase in net sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Group’s lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.

EMG’s

net sales totaled $1,342.7 million for 2011, an increase of $195.9 million or 17.1% when compared with
$1,146.8 million in 2010. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 6%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, and was driven by increases in EMG’s differentiated businesses. The
acquisitions of Coining, Avicenna, Haydon Enterprises and TSE accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase.

EMG’s operating income was $262.7 million for 2011, an increase of $52.3 million or 24.9% when compared with $210.4 million in 2010. EMG’s operating margins were 19.6% of net sales for 2011
compared with 18.3% of net sales in 2010. EMG’s increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to the leveraged impact of the Group’s increase in net sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Group’s lower
cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.



Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Results of Operations

In 2010, the Company posted strong sales and established records for operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these
results from strong internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions of TSE, Haydon Enterprises and Atlas in 2010 and the acquisitions of High Standard Aviation in January 2009 and Ameron Global in December 2009. In
the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company began to experience increased order rates which continued through 2010.

Net sales for 2010 were $2,471.0 million, an increase of $372.6 million or 17.8% when compared with net sales of $2,098.4
million in 2009. Net sales for EIG were $1,324.1 million in 2010, an increase of 15.5% from net sales of $1,146.6 million in 2009. Net sales for EMG were $1,146.8 million in 2010, an increase of 20.5% from net sales of
$951.8 million in 2009. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2010 was driven by strong internal sales growth of
approximately 13%, with no impact from foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.

Total international sales for 2010 were $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of net sales, an increase of $179.6 million or 17.4% when compared with international sales of $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of net sales in
2009. The $179.6 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above, as well as continued expansion into Asia, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company
maintain a strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $564.5 million in 2010, an increase of $150.4 million or 36.3% compared with
$414.1 million in 2009. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from both the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.

New orders for 2010 were $2,651.3 million, an increase of $623.2 million or 30.7% when compared with $2,028.1 million in 2009. Throughout most of 2009, the Company experienced lower order
rates primarily as a result of the global economic recession, which began in late 2008 and continued through most of 2009. However, order rates stabilized in the third quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2010,
internal order growth was approximately 23%, excluding a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by both the Company’s differentiated and cost-driven businesses, with the acquisitions mentioned above accounting for the
remainder of the increase. As a result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2010 was $828.8 million, an increase of $180.4 million or 27.8% when compared with $648.4 million at December 31, 2009.

Segment operating income for 2010 was $526.6 million, an increase of $127.1 million or 31.8% when
compared with segment operating income of $399.5 million in 2009. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 21.3% in 2010 from 19.0% in 2009. The increase in segment operating income and segment operating margins resulted
primarily from the leveraged impact of the Company’s net sales increase noted above, as well as the benefits of the Company’s lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.

SG&A expenses for 2010 were $296.5 million, an increase of $42.4 million or 16.7% when compared with
$254.1 million in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 12.0% for 2010, compared with 12.1% in 2009. Selling expense increased $32.4 million or 14.7% for 2010, which was in line with internal sales growth. Selling expenses,
as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 10.3% for 2010, compared with 10.5% for 2009. Additionally, the Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher
marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expense increased approximately 11.1% for 2010.



Corporate administrative expenses for 2010 were $43.1 million, an increase
of $9.9 million or 29.8% when compared with $33.2 million in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.7% for 2010, compared with 1.6% in 2009. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven
by higher compensation related expenses, as well as other costs necessary to grow the business.

Consolidated
operating income was $482.2 million or 19.5% of net sales for 2010, an increase of $116.1 million or 31.7% when compared with $366.1 million or 17.4% of net sales in 2009.

Interest expense was $67.5 million for 2010, a decrease of $1.3 million or 1.9% when compared with $68.8 million in
2009. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the repayment of a 40 million British pound borrowing under the revolving credit facility in the second quarter of 2009 and a 50 million British pound senior note in the third quarter
of 2010, partially offset by the issuance of an 80 million British pound senior note in the third quarter of 2010.

Other expenses, net were $8.4 million for 2010, an increase of $5.7 million when compared with $2.7 million in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition related expenses.

The effective tax rate for 2010 was 30.1% compared with 30.2% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 primarily reflects
the impact of settlements of income tax examinations and the benefits obtained from international and state income tax planning initiatives.

Net income for 2010 was $283.9 million, an increase of $78.1 million or 37.9% when compared with $205.8 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share for 2010 were $1.76, an increase of $0.49 or 38.6%
when compared with $1.27 per diluted share in 2009.

Segment Results

EIG’s

net sales totaled $1,324.1 million for 2010, an increase of $177.5 million or 15.5% when compared with
$1,146.6 million in 2009. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 15%, with no impact from foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EIG’s process, power and industrial businesses. The acquisition of
Atlas primarily accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase.

EIG’s operating income was $316.2
million for 2010, an increase of $83.3 million or 35.8% when compared with $232.9 million in 2009. EIG’s operating margins were 23.9% of net sales for 2010 compared with 20.3% of net sales in 2009. The increase in segment operating income
and operating margins was driven by the leveraged impact of the Group’s increase in net sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Group’s lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.

EMG’s

net sales totaled $1,146.8 million for 2010, an increase of $195.0 million or 20.5% when compared with
$951.8 million in 2009. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 12%, with no impact from foreign currency translation. The acquisitions of Ameron Global, TSE and Haydon Enterprises primarily accounted for the
remainder of the net sales increase.

EMG’s operating income was $210.4 million for 2010, an increase of
$43.8 million or 26.3% when compared with $166.6 million in 2009. EMG’s operating margins were 18.3% of net sales for 2010 compared with 17.5% of net sales in 2009. EMG’s increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due
to the leveraged impact of the Group’s higher net sales, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $508.6 million in 2011, an increase of $85.6
million or 20.2% when compared with $423.0 million in 2010. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily



due to the $100.6 million increase in net income, partially offset by higher overall operating working capital levels necessary to grow the Company’s businesses. Free cash flow (cash
flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $457.8 million in 2011, compared with $383.8 million in 2010. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $712.2 million in 2011,
compared with $545.9 million in 2010. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the “Notes to Selected Financial Data” included in
Item 6 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).

Cash used for investing activities totaled $526.5 million in 2011, compared with $566.8 million in 2010. In 2011, the
Company paid $474.9 million for five business acquisitions, net of cash received, compared with $538.6 million paid for six business acquisitions, net of cash received, in 2010. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $50.8 million
in 2011, compared with $39.2 million in 2010.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $31.9
million in 2011, compared with $62.6 million in 2010. In 2011, net total borrowings increased by $99.1 million, compared with a net total borrowings increase of $139.3 million in 2010. In 2011, the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares of
its common stock for $59.3 million, compared with $78.6 million used for repurchases of 3.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock in 2010. In November 2011, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $100 million in
the authorization for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2011, $105.5 million was available under the Board authorization for future share repurchases.

In September 2011, AMETEK completed a new five-year revolving credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of $700
million, which excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. Interest
rates on outstanding loans under either the current or replaced revolving credit facility are at the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a negotiated spread, or at the U.S. prime rate. The new revolving credit
facility replaced a $450 million total borrowing capacity revolving credit facility, which excluded a $100 million accordion feature, that was due to expire in June 2012. The new revolving credit facility provides the Company with additional
financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy. At December 31, 2011, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $742.7 million under its revolving credit facility, including the
$200 million accordion feature.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company issued a 55 million
Swiss franc ($59.0 million) 2.44% senior note due December 2021.

In the third quarter of 2010, the Company
paid in full an expiring 50 million British pound ($78.2 million) 5.96% senior note. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company issued an 80 million British pound ($124.3 million at December 31, 2011) 4.68% senior note due September
2020.

At December 31, 2011, total debt outstanding was $1,263.9 million, compared with $1,168.5 million
at December 31, 2010, with no significant maturities until 2015. The debt-to-capital ratio was 38.1% at December 31, 2011, compared with 39.7% at December 31, 2010. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash
equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders’ equity) was 34.8% at December 31, 2011, compared with 36.2% at December 31, 2010. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure
is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the “Notes to Selected Financial Data” included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).

Additional financing activities for 2011 include cash dividends paid of $38.4 million compared with
$28.6 million in 2010. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options were $19.6 million in 2011, compared with $21.5 million in 2010.



As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in 2011, cash
and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 totaled $170.4 million, compared with $163.2 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $168.2 million in cash outside the United States. The Company
utilizes this cash to operate its international operations, as well as acquire international businesses. In the fourth quarter 2011, the Company utilized cash outside the United States to purchase EM Test. The Company is in compliance with all
covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital
funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.

The
following table summarizes AMETEK’s contractual cash obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flows in future years at December 31, 2011.

(1)

The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 because the timing
of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

(2)

Includes the $450 million private placement completed in 2007 and the $350 million private placement completed in 2008.

(3)

Although not contractually obligated, the Company expects to have the capability to repay the revolving credit loan within one year as permitted in
the credit agreement. Accordingly, $134.2 million was classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2011.

(4)

Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca SAS acquisition. The lease has a term of 12 years, which began in
July 2006, and is payable quarterly.

(5)

The leases expire over a range of years from 2012 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in
most of the leases.

(6)

Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

Other Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $26.8 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2011. Based on experience with these arrangements, the
Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.



Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant
impact on the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty
inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Company’s accounting policies and to
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Company’s accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially
different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Company’s significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete.
This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable.
For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect to sales
returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Company’s option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold
products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts.
The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience.
At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $22.5 million, $18.3 million and $16.0 million, respectively. The Company’s expense for warranty obligations was $13.2 million,
$10.6 million and $8.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty
expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals
may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific
customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of
time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The
allowance for possible losses on receivables was $7.8 million and $6.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which approximates
current replacement cost, for approximately 74% of its inventories at December 31, 2011. The last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 26% of its inventory at December 31, 2011.
For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $25.1 million and $23.9 million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related
management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.



•

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks
and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets to
the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which
involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be
required to record any such impairment losses.

The Company identifies its reporting units
at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our
reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The
annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the
Company’s long-range plan. The Company’s long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a
market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows
or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Company’s
overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in
fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units
still exceeded their respective carrying values by 66% to 443% for each of the Company’s reporting units.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists
of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty
method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such
trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.

The Company’s acquisitions
have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $2,114.0 million or 48.9% of the
Company’s total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2011 and determined that the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that
goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.

Other intangible assets
with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets



with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.

•

Pensions.

The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most
significant elements in determining the Company’s pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the
pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2011, the Company considered rates of return
on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2011 pension cost was 5.6% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and
5.71% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2011 and determining the 2012 defined benefit pension cost was 5.0% for U.S. plans and 5.22% for foreign plans. In estimating
the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Company’s actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity
dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2011 of 8.0% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.96% for foreign plans. The Company will use 8.0% for the U.S. plans in 2012 and 6.96% for the foreign
plans in 2012. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans’ investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable
fixed-income investments and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2011 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and was 2.98% for the foreign plans. The
U.S. rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2012. The foreign plans’ rates of compensation increase will decrease slightly to 2.97% in 2012. In 2011, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of
$7.4 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans, compared with pre-tax pension income of $3.2 million recognized for these plans in 2010. The Company estimates its 2012 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension
pre-tax expense to be approximately $0.7 million.

All unrecognized prior service costs,
remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net
periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011 which totaled
$5.4 million, compared with $3.6 million in 2010. The Company anticipates making approximately $3 million to $6 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012.

•

Income Taxes.

The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires
management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing
jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax assets and
liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Company’s forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available
tax planning



strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the
Company’s deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial
statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest
probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes,
published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit
practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASU 2010-06”). ASU 2010-06 provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and require new disclosures
related to fair value measurements, providing greater disaggregated information on each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair value measurements. The Company
adopted the applicable provisions within ASU 2010-06 effective January 1, 2010. The Company adopted the level 3 disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-06 that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for
interim periods within those fiscal years as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s fair value disclosures.

In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17,

Revenue Recognition — Milestone Method

(“ASU 2010-17”). ASU 2010-17 establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is achieved in research or development arrangements. In addition, it requires
disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones. ASU 2010-17 was effective on January 1, 2011 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No.
2010-29,

Business Combinations

(“ASU 2010-29”). ASU 2010-29 addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma disclosure requirement for business combinations. ASU 2010-29 requires disclosure
of pro forma revenue and earnings for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both the current and any
comparable periods reported. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-29 effective January 1, 2011. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for further details.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04,

Amendments to Achieve Common Fair
Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs

(“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair
value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has evaluated ASU 2011-04 and does not expect its
adoption will have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05,

Presentation of
Comprehensive Income

(“ASU 2011-05”). ASU 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive
statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other
comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2011-05 that is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and does not expect its adoption to impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08,

Testing Goodwill for Impairment

(“ASU 2011-08”). The amendments in ASU 2011-08 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a
basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other

. ASU 2011-08 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adopting ASU 2011-08 and intends to adopt ASU 2011-08 for the year ending December 31, 2012.

Internal Reinvestment

Capital
Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $50.8 million or 1.7% of net sales in 2011, compared with
$39.2 million or 1.6% of net sales in 2010. 55% of the expenditures in 2011 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Company’s 2011 capital expenditures increased
due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2012 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 1.8% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.

Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research,
development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $137.6 million, $112.1 million and $101.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $6.1 million, $6.4 million and
$5.5 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $78.0 million, $56.8 million and $50.5 million, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new
products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.

Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December 31, 2011, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party
(“PRP”) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to
the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The
tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for
remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company



is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s expected obligations.
The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable
remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned” sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the
Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the
Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and
the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company’s liability for
remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $28.0 million and $31.3 million,
respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2011, the Company recorded $1.2 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $4.5 million on environmental matters in 2011. The Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities
at December 31, 2011 and 2010 include reserves of $17.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is the designated
performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances
from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $14.3 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other
committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third
parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the
ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Market Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to
market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal
operating and financing activities. The Company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.

The Company’s short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates.
These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant
exchange rate exposure are the Chinese renminbi, the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local
borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.
Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper,
steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to
manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates,
commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects
may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and
uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Company’s actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important
factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors
or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of the consolidated financial statements and related
information. The statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and include certain amounts based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility
for the reliability of the financial information, management maintains a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit program. The system of controls provides for appropriate division of responsibility and the
application of written policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. We maintain a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however, there are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any system of internal controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Company’s activities according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for all employees and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors who are not employees of the Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, the
internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The report of the Audit Committee is included in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Both the
independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an opinion as to whether management’s financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the Company’s financial position and operating results. This report is included herein.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We
have audited AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows
of AMETEK, Inc. (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions in the consolidation. The Company’s investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are
accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not significant to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010, all of the Company’s equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as “available-for-sale,” although the Company may hold fixed-income
securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income securities generally mature within three years. The aggregate market value of equity and fixed-income securities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $7.3 million ($7.3 million
amortized cost) and $4.7 million ($4.5 million amortized cost), respectively. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such securities is recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (in stockholders’
equity), and is not significant. Certain of the Company’s other investments, which are not significant, are also accounted for by the equity method of accounting as discussed above.

Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their
financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful receivables is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $7.8 million and $6.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 7.

Inventories

The Company uses the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for 74% of its inventories at December 31, 2011. The last-in, first-out
(“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 26% of the Company’s inventory at December 31, 2011. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value over the
LIFO value was $25.1 million and $23.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand,
market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their
useful lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies, and maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable assets is generally three to ten years for machinery and equipment, five to 27 years for leasehold improvements and 25 to 50 years for buildings.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs
when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage
of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances,
generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Company’s option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor
purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for
these sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the income statement. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past
experience. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $22.5 million, $18.3 million and $16.0 million, respectively. The Company’s expense for warranty obligations was
$13.2 million in 2011, $10.6 million in 2010 and $8.2 million in 2009. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Research and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $78.0 million in 2011,
$56.8 million in 2010 and $50.5 million in 2009.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and were $35.9 million in 2011, $33.3 million in 2010
and $24.6 million in 2009.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Earnings Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares considered
outstanding during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities (principally outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used
in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was as follows for the years ended December 31:

Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency
Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at
the balance sheet date and their results of operations are translated using average exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their functional currency. Exchange gains and
losses from those transactions are included in operating results for the year.

The Company makes infrequent
use of derivative financial instruments. Forward contracts are entered into from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain inventory purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the Company’s exposure to raw material
commodity price or foreign currency fluctuation. No forward contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010. In instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within stockholders’ equity to the extent they are effective as hedges. The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the
net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December 31, 2011, these net investment hedges are the Company’s British-pound-denominated long-term debts, pertaining to certain of its investments in 100% owned subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the British pound. As of December 31, 2010, these net investment hedges included the British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debts. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign
subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates.
These net investment hedges were evidenced by management’s documentation supporting the contemporaneous hedge designation on the acquisition dates. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation, is reported
in AOCI in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, all net investment hedges were effective. At
December 31, 2011, the translation losses on the net carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the translation gains on the carrying value of the underlying debt and the difference was included in AOCI. At
December 31, 2010, the translation losses on the net carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the translation gains on the carrying value of the underlying debt and the difference was included in AOCI. An
evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate. See Note 4.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,

Compensation–Stock Compensation.

Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the
consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 11.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized;
rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.

The Company identifies its reporting units at the
component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units
are composed of business units and are one level below our operating segment and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sales transaction. The
annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the
Company’s long-range plan. The Company’s long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a
market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows
or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the
carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as
the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.

The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010 and 2009 and determined that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
lives were not impaired.

The Company evaluates impairment of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows
from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group. Fair market
value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group. Losses on long-lived assets held for sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar
manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are
amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents are being amortized over useful lives of four to 20 years. Customer relationships are being amortized over a period of five to 20 years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being
amortized over a period of three to 20 years. The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets.

Income Taxes

The Company’s annual provision for income taxes and determination of the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the
outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the
Company’s tax assets and liabilities may be necessary. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

The Company also is required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the
Company’s forecast of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.
Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances
may be required.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASU 2010-06”). ASU 2010-06 provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and require new disclosures related to fair
value measurements, providing greater disaggregated information on each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted the
applicable provisions within ASU 2010-06 effective January 1, 2010. The Company adopted the level 3 disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-06 that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim
periods within those fiscal years as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s fair value disclosures.

In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17,

Revenue
Recognition — Milestone Method

(“ASU 2010-17”). ASU 2010-17 establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is achieved in research or development
arrangements. In addition, it requires disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones. ASU 2010-17 was effective on January 1, 2011 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact
on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2010, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2010-29,

Business Combinations

(“ASU 2010-29”). ASU 2010-29 addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma disclosure requirement for business combinations. ASU 2010-29
requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both
the current and any comparable periods reported. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-29 effective January 1, 2011. See Note 5.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04,

Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs

(“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for
measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has evaluated
ASU 2011-04 and does not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05,

Presentation of
Comprehensive Income

(“ASU 2011-05”). ASU 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive
statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other
comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2011-05 that is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and does not expect its adoption to impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2011-08,

Testing Goodwill for Impairment

(“ASU 2011-08”). The amendments in ASU 2011-08 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350,

Intangibles — Goodwill and
Other

. ASU 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adopting ASU 2011-08 and intends to adopt ASU 2011-08 for the year
ending December 31, 2012.

Fair Value Measurement

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value.
This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs based on the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement.

At December 31, 2011, $0.2 million of the Company’s marketable
securities are valued as level 1 investments. In addition, the Company held $4.4 million of marketable securities in an institutional diversified equity securities mutual fund. These securities are valued as level 2 investments. The
marketable securities are shown as a separate line on the consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2011, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not significant. No transfers between level 1 and level 2
investments occurred during the year ended December 31, 2011.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair value of the institutional equity securities mutual fund was
estimated using the net asset value of the Company’s ownership interests in the fund’s capital. The mutual fund seeks to provide long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in equity securities traded on U.S. exchanges and issued by
large, established companies across many business sectors. There are no restrictions on the Company’s ability to redeem these equity securities investments.

4.

Hedging Activities

The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the
net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December 31, 2011, these net investment hedges are the Company’s British-pound-denominated long-term debt, pertaining to certain of its investments in 100% owned subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the British pound. As of December 31, 2010, these net investment hedges included the British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debts. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign
subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates.
These net investment hedges were evidenced by management’s documentation supporting the contemporaneous hedge designation on the acquisition dates. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $186.5 million and $187.2 million, respectively, of
British-pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in 2008, 2006, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2010, the Company had a $66.9 million Euro-denominated loan, which
was designated as a hedge against the net investment in a foreign subsidiary acquired in 2005. As a result of these British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans being designated and effective as net investment hedges, $0.7 million and
$9.9 million of currency remeasurement gains have been included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

price for the net assets of the above acquisitions based on their estimated fair value at December 31, 2011 (in millions):

*

Includes $28.3 million in accounts receivable, whose fair value, contractual cash flows and expected cash flows are approximately equal.

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits the Company expects to realize from the
acquisitions as follows: Avicenna provides the Company with additional expertise in producing fine-featured catheter and other medical components for leads, guide wires and custom medical assemblies. Avicenna complements the Company’s medical
device market businesses and is an excellent fit with its Technical Services for Electronics (“TSE”) business, which was acquired in 2010. The combination of these two businesses positions AMETEK as the only medical interconnects provider
with integrated capabilities for the catheter, cardiac and neurostimulation markets. Coining is a global leader in custom-shaped preforms, microstampings and wire used for joining electronic circuitry, packaging microelectronics and providing
thermal protection and electric conductivity for a wide range of electronic devices. Coining’s products are used in highly engineered applications for the RF/microwave, photonics, medical, aerospace and defense, and general electronics
industries. Coining is an excellent fit with the engineered materials, interconnects and packaging businesses. Reichert Technologies is a leader and innovator in high-technology instruments used by ophthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians for

with a broad range of custom active piezoelectric vibration cancellation systems, based on their patented active piezo technology. TMC also supplies passive vibration cancellation systems, optical test tables, acoustic isolation hoods and magnetic
isolation hoods. TMC is an excellent fit with the Company’s high-end analytical instruments businesses and further broadens the Company’s product offerings and expertise in ultra precision manufacturing. The Company expects approximately
$47.0 million of the goodwill recorded in connection with 2011 acquisitions will be tax deductible in future years.

The Company is in the process of finalizing the deferred taxes for its fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of Reichert Technologies, EM Test and TMC. Additionally, the Company is in the process of finalizing
its third-party valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets related to its TMC acquisition. The Company recorded $2.5 million in contingent liabilities for the TMC acquisition primarily related to final tax true ups tied to, among other
things, the final third-party valuation.

At December 31, 2011, purchase price allocated to other
intangible assets of $260.0 million consists of $63.0 million of indefinite-lived intangible trademarks and trade names, which are not subject to amortization.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The remaining $197.0 million of other intangible assets consist of $178.9 million of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of 12 to 20 years and
$18.1 million of purchased technology and other, which are being amortized over a period of three to 20 years. Amortization expense for each of the next five years for the 2011 acquisitions listed above is expected to approximate
$11.1 million per year.

In 2010, the Company spent $538.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to
acquire TSE in June 2010, Haydon Enterprises in July 2010, Atlas Material Testing Technology LLC (“Atlas”) in November 2010, as well as the small acquisitions of Sterling Ultra Precision in January 2010, Imago Scientific Instruments in
April 2010 and American Reliance’s Power Division in August 2010. TSE is a manufacturer of engineered interconnect solutions for the medical device industry. Haydon Enterprises is a leader in linear actuators and lead screw assemblies for the
medical, industrial equipment, aerospace, analytical instrument, computer peripheral and semiconductor industries. Atlas is the world’s leading provider of weathering test instruments and related testing and consulting services. Atlas is a part
of EIG and TSE and Haydon Enterprises are part of EMG.

The 2011 acquisitions noted above had an immaterial
impact on reported net sales, net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011. Had the 2011 acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2011 or 2010, unaudited pro forma net sales, net income and diluted earnings
per share for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would not have been materially different than the amounts reported. Pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the
acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 2011 or 2010.

In 2009, the Company spent
$72.9 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire High Standard Aviation in January 2009, a small acquisition of two businesses in India, Unispec Marketing Pvt. Ltd. and Thelsha Technical Services Pvt. Ltd., in September 2009 and Ameron
Global in December 2009. High Standard Aviation is a provider of electrical and electromechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic repair services to the aerospace industry. Ameron Global is a manufacturer of highly engineered pressurized gas components and
systems for commercial and aerospace customers and is also a leader in maintenance, repair and overhaul of fire suppression and oxygen supply systems. High Standard Aviation and Ameron Global are a part of EMG.

The Company’s effective tax rate reconciles to the U.S. Federal statutory rate as follows for the
years ended December 31:

At December 31, 2011, there has been no provision for U.S. deferred income taxes for the
undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which total approximately $410.3 million at December 31, 2011, because the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United States. Upon
distribution of those earnings to the United States, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability
on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $5.7 million of deferred income taxes for undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were distributed during 2011.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2011, the Company had tax benefits of
$3.5 million related to net operating loss carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes net operating loss
carryforwards of $0.2 million for federal income tax purposes with no valuation allowance, $3.0 million for state income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.1 million, and $0.3 million for foreign income tax purposes
with no valuation allowance. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2012 and 2032. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $0.3 million of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than
not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. In 2011, the Company recorded a decrease of $4.7 million in the valuation allowance
primarily related to a reduction for net operating losses that are no longer available as well as a valuation allowance related to state research and development credits that are now expected to be utilized.

At December 31, 2011, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $28.5 million, of which
$25.9 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. At December 31, 2010, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $22.8 million, of which $18.3 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax
rate.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company reported $7.2 million and $6.1 million,
respectively, related to interest and penalty exposure as accrued income tax expense in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized $1.1 million of expense, $1.9 million of expense and
$0.7 million of income, respectively, for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income statement as a component of income tax expense.

The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the United States. The Company files income tax returns in
various state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and six years in these jurisdictions. At
December 31, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been and is continuing to examine the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for the years 2006 through 2009. The IRS previously completed the examination of the
Company’s U.S. income tax returns for the years 2006 and 2007, however, the periods were reopened by the Company for a limited scope examination of the research and development credit. The Company has not materially extended any other statutes
of limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods including state and foreign jurisdictions that remain subject to examination. There have been no penalties asserted or
imposed by the IRS related to substantial understatement of income, gross valuation misstatement or failure to disclose a listed or reportable transaction.

During 2011, the Company added $9.6 million of tax, interest and penalties related to 2011 activity for identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $2.9 million of tax and interest related
to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions. During 2010, the Company added $5.4 million of tax, interest and penalties related to 2010 activity for identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $8.4 million of tax
and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.

The following is a reconciliation of the liability for uncertain tax
positions at December 31:

In 2011, the additions above primarily reflect the increase in tax liabilities for uncertain tax
positions related to certain foreign activities, while the reductions above primarily relate to a revised UK tax claim and tax paid as a result of a foreign dividend payment. At December 31, 2011, tax, interest and penalties of
$30.4 million were classified as a noncurrent liability. The net increase in uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2011 resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $3.2 million.

In September 2011, the Company completed a new five-year revolving credit facility with a total borrowing
capacity of $700 million, which excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain
conditions. The revolving credit facility places certain restrictions on allowable additional indebtedness. The new revolving credit facility replaced a $450 million total borrowing capacity revolving credit facility, which excluded a
$100 million accordion feature, that was due to expire in June 2012. At December 31, 2011, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $742.7 million under its revolving credit facility, including the $200 million accordion
feature.

Interest rates on outstanding loans under either the current or replaced revolving credit facility
are at the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a negotiated spread, or at the U.S. prime rate. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $134.2 million and $92.0 million, respectively, of borrowings
outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 1.10% and 0.82%, respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $25.9 million and $22.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The
private placements, the senior notes and the revolving credit facility are subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain debt-to-EBITDA and interest coverage
ratios. The Company was in compliance with all provisions of the debt arrangements at December 31, 2011.

Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are compared below to the
recorded amounts at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value at December 31, 2011 and 2010 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The fair value of fixed-income
investments is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value. The Company’s long-term debt is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore, the fair value of
long-term debt was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments. See Note 9 for long-term debt principals, interest rates and maturities.

Share-Based Compensation

Under the terms of the Company’s stockholder-approved share-based plans, incentive and
non-qualified stock options and restricted stock have been, and may be, issued to the Company’s officers, management-level employees and members of its Board of Directors. Employee and non-employee director stock options generally vest at a
rate of 25% per year, beginning one year from the date of the grant, and restricted stock generally has a four-year cliff vesting. Stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of seven years. At December 31, 2011,
15.4 million shares of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company’s share-based plans, including 5.5 million shares for stock options outstanding.

The Company issues previously unissued shares when stock options are exercised and shares are issued from treasury stock
upon the award of restricted stock.

The Company measures and records compensation expense related to all
stock awards by recognizing the grant date fair value of the awards over their requisite service periods in the financial statements. For grants under any of the Company’s plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the
Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair values of options granted during the years indicated:

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
Company’s stock. The Company used historical exercise data to estimate the stock options’ expected term, which represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the
future stock option holding periods will be similar to the historical stock option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of
grant. Compensation expense recognized for all share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The Company’s estimated forfeiture rates are based on its historical experience.

Total share-based compensation expense was as follows for the years ended December 31:

Pre-tax share-based compensation expense is included in either cost of sales, or selling, general and
administrative expenses, depending on where the recipient’s cash compensation is reported.

The following

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was
$28.2 million, $29.3 million and $15.5 million, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $7.5 million, $7.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively.

The following is a summary of the Company’s nonvested stock option
activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2011:

As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately $12.8 million of expected future pre-tax
compensation expense related to the 2.5 million nonvested stock options outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than two years.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Company’s restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of
the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock, the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation) at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of
capital in excess of par value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived service period as determined on the grant date.

Restricted stock grants are subject to accelerated vesting due to certain events, including doubling of the
grant price of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business during any five consecutive trading days. On April 6, 2011, 509,709 shares of restricted stock, which were granted on April 23, 2009, vested under this
accelerated vesting provision. The pre-tax charge to income due to the accelerated vesting of these shares was $5.2 million ($3.6 million net after-tax charge) for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The following is a summary of the Company’s nonvested restricted stock activity and related information for the year
ended December 31, 2011:

The total fair value of the restricted stock that vested was $18.6 million and $5.7 million
in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 2009 was not significant. The weighted average fair value of restricted stock granted per share during 2011 and 2010 was $44.41 and $29.01, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately

$17.3 million of expected future pre-tax compensation expense related to the 0.9 million nonvested restricted shares outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of approximately two years.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(“SERP”) in 2011, the Company reserved 34,988 shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements and terminations were 12,667 shares in 2011. The total number of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was 445,488 as of
December 31, 2011. Charges to expense under the SERP are not significant in amount and are considered pension expense with the offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par value.

Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of service and/or
compensation. The following is a brief description of the Company’s retirement and pension plans.

The
Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company estimates
that it will make both required and discretionary cash contributions of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans in 2012.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit
pension plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for eligible U.S. employees.
Participants in the retirement and savings plan may contribute a specified portion of their compensation on a before-tax basis, which vary by location. The Company matches employee contributions ranging from 20% to 100%, up to a maximum percentage
ranging from 1% to 8% of eligible compensation or up to a maximum of $1,200 per participant in some locations.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined contribution retirement feature principally to cover U.S.
salaried employees joining the Company after December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary subject to
pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the Company’s foreign operations participate in various local defined contribution plans.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual arrangements and/or a SERP
covering certain current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement benefits that would have been provided under the Company’s primary retirement plan, except for
statutory limitations on compensation that must be taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be funded by a grant of shares of the Company’s common stock upon retirement
or termination of the executive. The Company is providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the applicable periods.

This asset class was invested in diversified companies in all geographical regions.

U.S. equity securities and global equity securities categorized as Level 1 are traded on national and
international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. For U.S. equity securities and global equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee
obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.

Additionally, some U.S. equity securities and global equity securities are public investment vehicles valued using the
Net Asset Value (“NAV”) provided by the fund manager. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding. U.S. equity securities and global equity securities are categorized as Level 1 if traded at their NAV
on a nationally recognized securities exchange or categorized as Level 2 if the NAV is corroborated by observable market data.

Fixed income securities categorized as Level 1 are traded on national
and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year and categorized as Level 2 if valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data, bids provided by brokers or
dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.

Alternative investments categorized as
Level 3 are valued based on unobservable inputs and cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data.

The following is a summary of the changes in the fair value of the U.S. plans’ level 3 investments (fair value using significant unobservable inputs):

The expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was 8.00% in 2011 and 8.25% in 2010. Equity
securities included 626,324 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of $26.4 million (6.0% of total plan investment assets) at December 31, 2011 and 861,300 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of
$33.8 million (7.3% of total plan investment assets) at December 31, 2010.

The objectives of the
AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the plans’ funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long term, an investment policy
that favors equity holdings has been established. Since there may be periods of time where both equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the overall portfolio’s
diversification and return potential. The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The actual asset allocation is
monitored frequently relative to the established targets and ranges and is rebalanced when necessary. The target allocations for the U.S. defined benefits plans are approximately 50% equity securities, 25% fixed-income securities and 25% other
securities and/or cash.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and style. The equity
portfolio also includes an international component.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets is to
provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of interest rate
fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in the footnote to the table above,
certain investments are prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital, private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading, commodities, short selling and rights and warrants. Foreign currency futures, options and
forward contracts may be used to manage foreign currency exposure.

The following is a summary of the fair
value of plan assets for foreign defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Equity funds, real estate funds and fixed income funds that are valued by the vendor using observable
market inputs are considered level 2 investments. Life insurance assets are considered level 3 investments as their values are determined by the sponsor using unobservable market data.

The following is a summary of the changes in the fair value of the foreign plans’ level 3 investments (fair value
determined using significant unobservable inputs):



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit plans’
investment strategy is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to
balance risks against the current and future needs of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the different asset classes, relative to the plans’ liabilities and how this can be affected by diversification, and the relative
returns available on equities, fixed-income investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are considered. It is expected that equities will outperform fixed-income
investments over the long term. However, the trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and the immature
nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed, from time to time, in view of changes in market conditions and in
the plans’ liability profile. The target allocations for the foreign defined benefit plans are approximately 74% equity securities, 17% fixed-income securities and 9% other securities, insurance or cash.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was developed based on a review of historical investment returns
for the investment categories for the defined benefit pension assets. This review also considered current capital market conditions and projected future investment returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset class are lower than
the actual long-term historical returns. The current low interest rate environment influences this outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans is 8.0% and 6.96% for foreign plans in 2012.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a
projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets and pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were as follows at December 31:

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The estimated future benefit payments for U.S. and foreign plans are as follows (in thousands): 2012 – $29,668; 2013
– $30,328; 2014 – $31,126; 2015 – $31,912; 2016 – $32,889; 2017 to 2021 – $177,481. Future benefit payments primarily represent amounts to be paid from pension trust assets. Amounts included that are to be paid from the
Company’s assets are not significant in any individual year.

Postretirement Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than pensions for certain retirees and a small number of
former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and are not significant.

The Company also
provides limited postemployment benefits for certain former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit
for retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed invested in either, or a combination of, (a) an interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of the general
assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the plan, including income earned, was $19.5 million and
$16.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Administrative expense for the deferred compensation plan is borne by the Company and is not significant.

13.

Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. The Company primarily issues
guarantees, stand-by letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its business to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or enhance the subsidiary’s
stand-alone creditworthiness. The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular point in time. At December 31, 2011, the maximum amount of future payment
obligations relative to these various guarantees was $64.7 million and the outstanding liability under certain of those guarantees was $4.1 million.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition
and divestiture transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or retention
of previously existing environmental, tax or employee liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount of
these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims
against them in connection with their positions with the Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any, under
all existing indemnification agreements would not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Product Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty periods for products
sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual
warranty expenses.

Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as follows at December 31:

Certain settlements of warranties made during the period were for specific nonrecurring warranty
obligations. Product warranty obligations are reported as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

14.

Contingencies

Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At December 31, 2011, the
Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites
based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its
obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as
estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation
and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and
reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations
(the “owned” sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as
the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based
on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements;



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company’s liability for remediation, the
Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $28.0 million and $31.3 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2011, the Company recorded
$1.2 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $4.5 million on environmental matters in 2011. The Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 include reserves of $17.5 million
and $18.9 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of
several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial
activities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $14.3 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the
Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third
parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the
ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Leases and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases in effect at December 31, 2011
(principally for production and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to $131.3 million, consisting of payments of $27.0 million in 2012, $20.9 million in 2013, $16.1 million in 2014, $13.1 million in 2015,
$10.1 million in 2016 and $44.1 million thereafter. The leases expire over a range of years from 2012 to 2082, with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases. Rental expense was
$26.4 million in 2011, $23.1 million in 2010 and $22.8 million in 2009.

As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $275.5 million and $222.0 million, respectively, in purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

In 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 3,071,000 shares of common stock for
$78.6 million in cash under its share repurchase authorization. At December 31, 2010, $64.9 million was available under the Board authorization for future share repurchases. In 2011, the Company repurchased approximately
1,677,000 shares of common stock for $59.3 million in cash under its share repurchase authorization. In November 2011, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $100 million in the authorization for the repurchase of the
Company’s common stock. This increase was added to the $5.5 million that remained available from an existing $75 million authorization approved in 2010. At December 31, 2011, $105.5 million was available under the Board
authorization for future share repurchases.

At December 31, 2011, the Company held 8.8 million
shares in its treasury at a cost of $209.8 million, compared with 7.3 million shares at a cost of $153.6 million at December 31, 2010. The number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2011 was 160.4 million shares,
compared with 160.7 million shares at December 31, 2010.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan,
under which the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the close of business on June 2, 2007, and has authorized the issuance of one Right for each share of common
stock of the Company issued between the Record Date and the Distribution Date. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving acquisition of the Company’s common stock, that holders of Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be
entitled (i) to purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the
Plan expire in June 2017.

Fourth Quarter of 2008 Restructuring Charges and Asset Write-Downs

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million,
which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.17 per diluted share). These charges included restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs
($7.4 million). The charges included $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the Company’s workforce and $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities. Of the
$40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in Selling, general and
administrative expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in 2008 segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other
expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company in 2008 as part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented across the Company’s various businesses
during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs resulted from the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low-cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in
certain of the Company’s businesses.

Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information which is required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the
Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our system of disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of December 31, 2011. Based on
that evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Such evaluation did not identify any change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the
year ended December 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
