Products
    and Services

The Company markets its products worldwide through two operating
    groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and
    the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). EIG builds
    monitoring, testing, and calibration instruments and display
    devices for the process, aerospace, industrial and power
    markets. EMG is a supplier of electromechanical devices. EMG
    produces highly engineered electromechanical connectors for
    hermetic (moisture-proof) applications, specialty metals for
    niche markets, and brushless air-moving motors, blowers, and
    heat exchangers. End markets include aerospace, defense,
    mass-transit, medical and office products. The Company believes
    that EMG is the world’s largest manufacturer of air-moving
    electric motors for vacuum cleaners, and is a prominent producer
    of other floor care products. The Company continues to grow
    through strategic acquisitions focused on differentiated niche
    markets in instrumentation and electromechanical devices.

Competitive
    Strengths

Management believes that the Company has several significant
    competitive advantages that assist it in sustaining and
    enhancing its market positions. Its principal strengths include:

Significant Market Share.

AMETEK maintains a
    significant share in many of its targeted niche markets because
    of its ability to produce and deliver high-quality products at
    competitive prices. In EIG, the Company maintains significant
    market positions in many niche segments within the process,
    aerospace, industrial, and power instrumentation markets. In
    EMG, the Company maintains significant market positions in many
    niche segments including aerospace, defense, mass-transit,
    medical, office products, and air-moving motors for the floor
    care market.

Technological and Development
    Capabilities.

AMETEK believes it has certain
    technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to
    develop innovative products and maintain leading market
    positions. Historically, the Company has grown by extending its
    technical expertise into the manufacture of customized products
    for its customers, as well as through strategic acquisitions.
    EIG competes primarily on the basis of product innovation in
    several highly specialized instrumentation markets, including
    process measurement, aerospace, power, and heavy-vehicle
    dashboard instrumentation. EMG’s differentiated businesses
    focus on developing customized products for specialized
    applications in aerospace and defense, medical, business
    machines and other industrial applications. In its cost-driven
    motor business, EMG focuses on low-cost design



and manufacturing, while enhancing motor-blower performance
    through advances in power, efficiency, lighter weight and
    quieter operation.

Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing
    Operations.

EMG has motor manufacturing plants in
    China, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Brazil to lower its costs
    and achieve strategic proximity to its customers, providing the
    opportunity to increase international sales and market share.
    Certain of the Company’s electronic instrument businesses
    are also relocating manufacturing operations to low-cost
    locales. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and joint ventures
    in Europe, North America and Asia have resulted in additional
    cost savings and synergies through the consolidation of
    operations, product lines and distribution channels that benefit
    both operating groups.

Experienced Management Team.

Another key
    component of AMETEK’s success is the strength of its
    management team and its commitment to the performance of the
    Company. AMETEK’s senior management has extensive
    experience, averaging more than twenty years with the Company,
    and is financially committed to the Company’s success
    through Company-established stock ownership guidelines based on
    a set of salary multiples.

Business
    Strategy

AMETEK’s objectives are to increase the Company’s
    earnings and financial returns through a combination of
    operational and financial strategies. Those operational
    strategies include business acquisitions, new product
    development, global and market expansion, and Operational
    Excellence programs designed to achieve double-digit annual
    percentage growth in earnings per share and a superior return on
    total capital. To support those operational objectives,
    financial initiatives have been, or may be, undertaken,
    including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt
    refinancing, local-source financing in certain foreign
    countries, accounts receivable securitization and share
    repurchases. AMETEK’s commitment to earnings growth is
    reflected in its continued implementation of cost-reduction
    programs designed to achieve the Company’s long-term
    best-cost objectives.

AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key
    strategies:

Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The
    Company continues to pursue strategic acquisitions, both
    domestically and internationally, to expand and strengthen its
    product lines, improve its market share positions and increase
    earnings through sales growth and operational efficiencies at
    the acquired businesses. Since the beginning of 2002, to the
    date of this report, the Company has completed nine acquisitions
    with annualized sales totaling approximately $490 million,
    including three acquisitions in 2005 representing approximately
    $260 million in annualized revenues (see “Recent
    Acquisitions”). Those acquisitions have enhanced
    AMETEK’s position in analytical instrumentation, technical
    motors, power systems and instrumentation, and electromechanical
    connectors. Through these and prior acquisitions, the
    Company’s management team has gained considerable
    experience in successfully acquiring and integrating new
    businesses. The Company intends to continue to pursue this
    acquisition strategy.

Global and Market Expansion.

AMETEK’s
    largest international presence is in Europe, where it has
    operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Italy, the
    Czech Republic, France, Austria and the Netherlands. These
    operations provide design and engineering capability,
    product-line breadth, enhanced European distribution channels,
    and low-cost production. AMETEK has a leading market position in
    European floor care motors and a significant presence in many of
    its instrument businesses. It has grown sales in Latin America
    and Asia by building and expanding low-cost electric motor and
    instrument plants in Reynosa, Mexico, and motor manufacturing
    plants near Sao Paulo, Brazil and in Shanghai, China. It also
    continues to achieve geographic expansion and market expansion
    in Asia through joint ventures in China, Taiwan, Japan and South
    Korea and a direct sales and marketing presence in Singapore,
    Japan, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

    margins and strengthening the Company’s competitive
    position across its businesses. Through its Operational
    Excellence strategy, the Company seeks to reduce production
    costs and improve its market positions. The strategy has played
    a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies.
    AMETEK believes that Operational Excellence’s focus on Six
    Sigma process improvements and flow manufacturing, and its
    emphasis on team building and a participative management
    culture, have enabled the Company to improve operating
    efficiencies and product quality, increase customer satisfaction
    and yield higher cash flow from operations, while lowering
    operating and administrative costs and shortening manufacturing
    cycle times.

    Overview

Operating
    Performance

In 2005, AMETEK generated sales of approximately
    $1.4 billion, an increase of 16% from 2004, and increased
    net income by 25%. The Company set records for sales, operating
    income, net income and diluted earnings per share. This strong
    performance was driven by an improving economy, internal growth
    in each of the Company’s two segments, the contribution of
    recently acquired businesses and the Company’s continuing
    cost-reduction initiatives. Additionally, AMETEK generated
    record cash flow from its operating activities during 2005 of

Financial
    Information about Operating Segments, Foreign Operations, and
    Export Sales

Reportable segment and geographic information is shown on
    pages 59-61 of this report.

The Company’s Global and Market Expansion growth strategy
    is subject to certain risks that are inherent in conducting
    business outside the United States. Those include fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates and controls, restrictions on the
    movement of funds, import and export controls, and other
    economic, political, tax and regulatory policies of the
    countries in which business is conducted. (Also see
    Item 1A. Risk Factors).

The Company’s foreign sales (approximately 46% of total
    sales in 2005 compared with 44% in 2004) have increased
    from a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. This
    combination has resulted in increases in export sales of
    products manufactured in the United States and sales from
    overseas operations.

    proprietary manufacturing technology and strong customer
    relationships.

With the acquisition of HCC in October 2005, EMG added a
    significant new product line. HCC designs and manufactures
    high-precision

glass-to-metal

seals and

ceramic-to-metal

seals. These seals protect sensitive electronics from the
    environment as well as provide thermal management capabilities.
    Products fall into three categories: connectors, terminals and
    headers, and microcircuit packaging. Connectors facilitate the
    passage of electrical current between two devices and allow them
    to be mechanically coupled and decoupled. Terminals and headers
    are interconnect devices that isolate electrical signals.
    Microcircuit packaging protects semiconductor circuitry from the
    environment. Key markets for HCC’s products are aerospace
    and defense, industrial and petrochemical markets.



Technical
    Motors and Systems Markets and Products

Technical motors and systems, representing 38% of EMG’s
    2005 sales, consist of brushless motors, blowers and pumps as
    well as other electromechanical systems. Their products are used
    in aerospace, business machines, computer equipment, defense,
    mass transit vehicles, medical equipment applications, power,
    and industrial applications.

EMG produces electronically commutated (brushless) motors,
    blowers and pumps that offer long life, reliability and near
    maintenance-free operation. These motor-blower systems and heat
    exchangers are used for thermal management and other
    applications on a wide variety of military and commercial
    aircraft and military ground vehicles, and are used increasingly
    in medical and other applications, in which their long life and
    spark-free and reliable operation is very important. These
    motors provide cooling and ventilation for business machines,
    computers, and mass transit vehicles. In the emerging fuel cell
    market, AMETEK is working closely with many of the leading
    developers of fuel cell technology, to produce blowers and pumps
    specifically developed for these applications.

EMG’s Prestolite switch business produces solenoids and
    other electromechanical devices for the motive and stationary
    power markets. The Prestolite battery charger business
    manufactures high-quality industrial battery chargers for use in
    the materials handling market. Both the switch and battery
    charger businesses have strong market positions and enjoy a
    reputation for high quality and service.

Floor
    Care and Specialty Motor Markets and Products

Approximately 44% of EMG sales are to floor care and specialty
    motor markets, where it has the leading share, through its sales
    of air-moving electric motors to most of the world’s major
    floor care OEMs, including vertically integrated OEMs that
    produce some of their own motors. EMG produces motor-blowers for
    a full range of floor care products, ranging from hand-held,
    canister, and upright vacuums to central vacuums for residential
    use. High-performance vacuum motors also are marketed for
    commercial and industrial applications.

The Company also manufactures a variety of specialty motors used
    in a wide range of products, such as household and personal care
    appliances; fitness equipment; electric materials handling
    vehicles; and sewing machines. Additionally, its products are
    used in outdoor power equipment, such as electric chain saws,
    leaf blowers, string trimmers and power washers.

EMG has been successful in directing a portion of its global
    floor care marketing at vertically integrated vacuum cleaner
    manufacturers, who seek to outsource all or part of their motor
    production. By purchasing their motors from EMG, these customers
    are able to realize economic and operational advantages by
    reducing or discontinuing their own motor production and
    avoiding the capital investment required to keep their motor
    manufacturing current with changing technologies and market
    demands.

EMG has focused its new product development efforts on
    minimizing costs and enhancing motor-blower performance through
    advances in power, efficiency, size, weight, and quieter
    operation. Among its latest advances are the
    ADVANTEK

tm

series of universal vacuum motors that incorporate design and
    construction techniques that lower cost while improving
    operating efficiency and reliability; the
    Air-Watt

tm

Series of commercial motor-blowers, whose advanced design
    translates directly into higher performance and energy savings
    for end users; and ACUSTEK
    Plus

tm

low-noise commercial vacuum motors.

Customers

EMG is not dependent on any single customer such that the loss
    of that customer would have a material adverse effect on
    EMG’s operations. Approximately 9% of EMG’s sales for
    2005 were made to its five largest customers.

Marketing

The Company’s marketing efforts generally are organized and
    carried out at the division level. EIG makes significant use of
    distributors and sales representatives in marketing its
    products, as well as direct sales in some of its more
    technically sophisticated products. Within aerospace, its
    specialized customer base of aircraft and jet engine



manufacturers is served primarily by direct sales engineers.
    Given the technical nature of many of its products as well as
    its significant worldwide market share, EMG conducts most of its
    domestic and international marketing activities through a direct
    sales force and makes some use of sales representatives and
    distributors both in the United States and in other countries.

Competition

In general, most of the Company’s markets are highly
    competitive. The principal elements of competition for the
    Company’s products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality, and service.

In the markets served by EIG, the Company believes that it ranks
    among the leading U.S. producers of certain measuring and
    control instruments. It also is a leader in the
    U.S. heavy-vehicle instrumentation and power instrument
    markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers
    to the commercial aviation market. Competition remains strong
    and can intensify for certain EIG products, especially its
    pressure gauge and heavy-vehicle instrumentation. Both of these
    businesses have several strong competitors. In the process and
    analytical instruments market, numerous companies in each
    specialized market compete on the basis of product quality,
    performance and innovation. The aerospace and power instrument
    businesses have a number of diversified competitors, which vary
    depending on the specific market niche.

EMG’s differentiated businesses have competition from a
    limited number of companies in each of their markets.
    Competition is generally based on product innovation,
    performance and price. There also is competition from
    alternative materials and processes. In its cost-driven
    businesses, EMG has limited domestic competition in the
    U.S. floor care market from independent manufacturers.
    Competition is increasing from Asian motor manufacturers that
    serve both the U.S. and the European floor care markets.
    Increasingly, global vacuum motor production is being shifted to
    Asia where AMETEK has a weaker market position. There is
    potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers
    of floor care products that produce their own motor-blowers.
    Many of these manufacturers would also be potential EMG
    customers if they decided to outsource their motor production.

Backlog
    and Seasonal Variations of Business

The Company’s approximate backlog of unfilled orders by
    business segment at the dates specified below was as follows:

December 31,




(In millions)

The higher backlog at December 31, 2005 was primarily due
    to the three businesses acquired in 2005, as well as increased
    order rates, primarily in the Company’s differentiated
    businesses.

Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31,
    2005, approximately 89% is expected to be shipped by
    December 31, 2006. The Company believes that neither its
    business as a whole, nor either of its operating segments, is
    subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain
    individual operations experience some seasonal variability.

Availability
    of Raw Materials

The Company’s business segments obtain raw materials and
    supplies from a variety of sources, and generally from more than
    one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various
    base metals and certain steel components, are available only
    from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes its
    sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs.



Research,
    Product Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development, and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development, and engineering costs
    before customer reimbursement were $75.9 million,
    $66.0 million and $56.1 million, in 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2005, 2004 and
    2003 were $8.9 million, $6.2 million and
    $6.2 million, respectively. These amounts included net
    Company-funded research and development expenses of
    $34.8 million, $25.5 million and $21.4 million,
    respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the
    development of new products and processes, and the improvement
    of existing products and processes.

Environmental
    Matters

Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth
    on page 27 of this report in the section of
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations entitled “Environmental
    Matters.”

Patents,
    Licenses and Trademarks

The Company owns numerous unexpired U.S. patents and
    foreign patents, including counterparts of its more important
    U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the
    world. The Company is a licensor or licensee under patent
    agreements of various types, and its products are marketed under
    various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign trademarks
    and trade names. However, the Company does not consider any
    single patent or trademark, or any group thereof, essential
    either to its business as a whole or to either of its business
    segments. The annual royalties received or paid under license
    agreements are not significant to either of its business
    segments or to the Company’s overall operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2005, the Company employed approximately
    9,800 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of whom
    approximately 2,800 employees were covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. The Company has two collective bargaining
    agreements that will expire in 2006, which cover less than 100
    employees. The Company expects no material adverse effects from
    the pending labor contract negotiations.

Working
    Capital Practices

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital
    requirements in either of its business segments. Customers
    generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include
    extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled
    and maintained at levels related to production cycles, and are
    responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all
    other information contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Our
    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be
    able to consummate future acquisitions, to successfully
    integrate recent and future acquisitions or to finance future
    acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of
    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2002, we have
    completed nine acquisitions. We plan to continue making
    strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and
    broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful
    with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to
    effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of
    factors, including:

•

Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;



•

Increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase
    acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate
    acquisitions on favorable terms;

•

Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including
    integrating the financial, technological and management
    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses
    with those of our existing operations;

•

Financing for acquisitions not being available on terms
    acceptable to us, or at all;

•

U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our
    ability to make certain acquisitions;

•

Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of
    acquired businesses;

•

Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

•

Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity
    and complexity of our operations.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing
    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and
    may require additional financial resources and attention from
    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing
    development or expansion of our existing operations. Failure to
    continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful
    integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and
    financial condition.

We may
    experience unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new
    facilities.

Certain of our businesses are relocating, or have recently
    relocated, manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
    Unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities, as
    well as possible underutilizations of our existing facilities,
    could result in product inefficiencies, which would adversely
    affect our business and operations.

Our
    substantial international sales and operations are subject to
    customary risks associated with international
    operations.

International sales for 2005 and 2004 represented approximately
    46% and 44% of our total net sales, respectively. As a result of
    our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales
    outside the United States will continue to increase in the
    future. International operations are subject to the customary
    risks of operating in an international environment, including:

•

Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;

•

Overlap of different tax structures;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including
    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries
    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;

•

Restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

General economic conditions;

•

Unstable political situations; and

•

Compliance with a wide variety of international and
    U.S. export laws and regulatory requirements.

If we
    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could
    adversely affect our business and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our
    ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced
    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.
    Although we believe we have certain technological and other
    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages
    will require us to continue



investing in research and development and sales and marketing.
    There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources
    to make such investments, that we will be able to make the
    technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive
    advantages, or that we can recover major research and
    development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging
    standards or new products, which could render our existing
    products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this
    will not occur or that we will be able to develop and
    successfully market new products.

A
    shortage or price increases in our raw materials could increase
    our operating costs.

We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material
    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;
    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel
    components, are available only from a limited number of
    suppliers. Shortages in raw materials or price increases
    therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs
    and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our
    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Certain
    environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs
    associated with hazardous or toxic substance

clean-up

which may adversely affect our financial
    condition.

Our business, operations and facilities are subject to a number
    of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
    occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning,
    among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the
    use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage,
    transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
    Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing
    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous
    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of
    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at
    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew
    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous
    materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint
    and several liability for

clean-up

costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing
    hazardous substances to sites designated for

clean-up

under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible
    party at several sites, which are the subject of
    government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership
    and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle
    and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur
    substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and
    capital expenditures in connection with compliance with
    environmental laws. While it is not possible to quantify the
    potential financial impact of pending environmental matters,
    based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of
    these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on
    our financial position or future results of operations. In
    addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of
    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis
    for new or increased liabilities that could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. There can be no assurance that future
    environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental
    damages due to prior or present practices will not result in
    future liabilities.

We are
    subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be
    burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and
    foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing
    laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new
    laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us.
    We cannot predict the impact any of these will have on our
    business or operations.

We may
    be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with
    alleged or actual harm caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product
    liability claims in the event that the use of our products is
    alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For
    example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for
    personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an
    aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or
    serviced by us. We may incur significant liability if product
    liability lawsuits against us



are successful. While we believe our current general liability
    and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from
    future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate
    to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be
    able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an
    acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for
    which third-party indemnification is not available could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We
    operate in a highly competitive industry, which may adversely
    affect our results of operations or ability to expand our
    business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and
    internationally, with individual producers as well as with
    vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have
    resources greater than we do. The principal elements of
    competition for our products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality and service. EMG’s competition in
    specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and
    processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG
    is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify.
    In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets
    served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the
    basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our
    competitors may develop new, or improve existing products that
    are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new
    technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There
    can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely
    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
    operates or that our products will be able to compete
    successfully with those of our competitors.

A
    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, heavy-vehicle,
    process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could
    adversely affect our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate may be cyclical in
    nature and may be affected by factors beyond our control. A
    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, heavy-vehicle,
    process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have
    an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Restrictions
    contained in our revolving credit facility may limit our ability
    to incur additional indebtedness.

Our existing revolving credit facility contains restrictive
    covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur
    indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to
    effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial
    flexibility.

Our
    goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial
    amount on our balance sheet and write-off of such substantial
    goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets,
    primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill and
    other intangible assets totaled approximately $900 million,
    or about 50% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our
    acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair
    value of the tangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum
    annually, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the
    value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance
    at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly
    below current levels, we could be required to record a non-cash
    charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment, under
    current applicable accounting rules. Any determination requiring
    the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized other
    intangible assets would negatively affect our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Properties

The Company has 64 operating plant facilities in 18 states
    and eleven foreign countries. Of these facilities, 46 are owned
    by the Company and 18 are leased. The properties owned by the
    Company consist of approximately



646 acres, of which approximately 4.7 million square
    feet are under roof. Under lease is a total of approximately
    888,000 square feet. The leases expire over a range of
    years from 2006 to 2031, with renewal options for varying terms
    contained in most of the leases. Production facilities in
    Taiwan, China, Japan and South Korea provide the Company with
    additional production capacity through the Company’s
    investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures.

The Company’s machinery and equipment, plants, and offices
    are in satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company and/or its subsidiaries have been named as
    defendants, along with many other companies, in a number of
    asbestos-related lawsuits. To date, no judgments have been made
    against the Company. The Company believes it has strong defenses
    to the claims, and intends to continue to defend itself
    vigorously in these matters. Other companies are also
    indemnifying the Company against certain of these claims. (Also
    see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) and Note 18 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Business
    Overview

As a multinational business, AMETEK’s operations are
    affected by global, regional and industry economic factors.
    However, the Company’s strategic geographic and industry
    diversification, and its mix of products and services, have
    helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable
    developments in any one industry or the economy of any single
    country on its consolidated operating results. In 2005, the
    Company experienced improved market conditions in most of its
    differentiated businesses. Strong internal growth and recent
    acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence
    initiatives, enabled the Company to post another year of record
    sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per
    share in 2005. In addition to achieving its financial
    objectives, the Company also continued to make progress on its
    strategic initiatives under AMETEK’s four growth
    strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions and
    Alliances, Global and Market Expansion, and New Products.
    Highlights of 2005 follow:

•

Sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of 16.4% from 2004 on
    solid internal growth in each of the Company’s business
    segments, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and
    the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”), and contributions
    from the three acquisitions completed during the year:

•

In June 2005, the Company acquired SPECTRO, which has expanded
    the Company’s elemental analysis capabilities in metal
    production and processing, environmental testing, hydrocarbon
    processing, aerospace, food processing, and pharmaceutical
    markets.

•

In September 2005, the Company acquired Solartron, which has
    broadened the Company’s analytical instrumentation product
    offerings for the process, laboratory and other industrial
    markets, expanding the Company’s geographic reach and
    capitalizing on significant synergies with the Company’s
    existing businesses.

•

In October 2005, the Company acquired HCC, which provides the
    Company with a new platform for the Company’s
    Electromechanical Group in the rapid design and production of
    hermetic (moisture-proof) connectors, terminals, headers and
    microelectronic packages for customer-specific applications.

•

As the Company continues to grow globally, it continues to
    achieve an increasing level of international sales. With this
    increase in international sales comes the potential for more
    exposure to foreign currency fluctuation. In 2005, foreign
    currency translation had a minimal positive impact on sales and
    a negligible impact on earnings. International sales, including
    U.S. export sales, represented 45.7% of consolidated sales
    in 2005, compared with 43.5% of sales in 2004.

•

The Company’s Operational Excellence strategy is directed
    toward lowering its overall cost structure, and includes the
    ongoing transition of a portion of the Company’s motor and
    instrument production to low-cost manufacturing facilities in
    Mexico, China and the Czech Republic. The Company believes this
    strategy had a positive impact on its operating results in 2005.
    Segment operating margins increased to 18.6% of sales in 2005,
    from 17.9% of sales in 2004.

•

Higher earnings resulted in cash flow from operating activities
    that totaled $165.9 million, a 2.9% increase from 2004. At
    year-end 2005, the

debt-to-capital

ratio was 43.9%, compared with 40.6% at the end of 2004.



The modest increase in the

debt-to-capital

ratio in 2005 was a result of the Company increasing its
    borrowings in the second half of the year to partially finance
    $340.7 million spent on the 2005 acquisitions.

•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research,
    development and engineering, spending $75.9 million in 2005
    before customer reimbursement of $8.9 million, an increase
    of 15.0% over 2004. Sales from products introduced in the last
    three years increased 31.7% in 2005 over 2004 to
    $229.9 million.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2005, Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2004

Results
    of Operations

In 2005, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
    income, and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved
    these results from acquisitions, internal growth in both its EIG
    and EMG groups, and cost reduction programs. The Company
    experienced improved market conditions in most of its businesses
    in 2005.

The Company reported sales for 2005 of $1,434.5 million, an
    increase of $202.1 million or 16.4% from sales of
    $1,232.3 million in 2004. Net sales for EIG were
    $808.5 million in 2005, an increase of 21.1% from sales of
    $667.4 million in 2004. EIG’s internal sales growth
    was 4.6% in 2005, driven by strength in its high-end analytical
    instruments business and the aerospace and power businesses. The
    acquisitions of SPECTRO in June 2005, Solartron in September
    2005, and Taylor Hobson in June 2004 also contributed to the
    sales growth. Net sales for EMG were $626.0 million in
    2005, an increase of 10.8% from sales of $564.9 million in
    2004. EMG’s internal sales growth was 4.2% in 2005, driven
    by the Group’s differentiated businesses, partially offset
    by flat market conditions within the Group’s cost-driven
    businesses. The acquisitions of HCC in October 2005 and
    Hughes-Treitler in July 2004 also contributed to the sales
    increase.

Total international sales for 2005 increased to
    $655.9 million or 45.7% of consolidated sales, an increase
    of $119.3 million or 22.2% when compared with international
    sales of $536.6 million or 43.5% of consolidated sales



in 2004. The increase in international sales resulted from the
    acquisitions previously mentioned as well as increased
    international sales from base businesses. Increased
    international sales came mainly from sales to Europe and Asia by
    both operating groups. Export shipments from the United States,
    which are included in total international sales, were
    $267.3 million in 2005, an increase of 15.2% compared with
    $232.0 million in 2004.

New orders for 2005 were $1,534.3 million, compared with
    $1,287.0 million for 2004, an increase of
    $247.3 million or 19.2%. Most of the increase in orders was
    driven by demand in the Company’s differentiated
    businesses, led by the Company’s aerospace and process
    businesses as well as the 2005 acquisitions mentioned above. The
    order backlog at December 31, 2005 was $440.7 million,
    compared with $340.9 million at December 31, 2004, an
    increase of $99.8 million or 29.3%. The increase in backlog
    was due mainly to the 2005 acquisitions. Backlog increases were
    also reported by many of the Company’s base differentiated
    businesses.

Segment operating income was $266.8 million for 2005, an
    increase of $46.2 million, or 20.9%, compared with segment
    operating income of $220.6 million for 2004. Segment
    operating margins in 2005 were 18.6% of sales, an increase from
    17.9% of sales in 2004. The increase in segment operating income
    was due to higher sales from the Company’s differentiated
    businesses. Approximately half of the increase in operating
    income was from the recent acquisitions. The margin improvement
    came entirely from the Company’s base differentiated
    businesses.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were
    $171.6 million in 2005, compared with $135.5 million
    in 2004, an increase of $36.1 million or 26.6%. As a
    percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 12.0% in 2005,
    compared with 11.0% in 2004. Selling expenses, as a percentage
    of sales, increased to 10.1% in 2005, compared with 9.1% in
    2004. The selling expense increase and the corresponding
    increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due
    primarily to business acquisitions. The Company’s
    acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated
    businesses, which, because of their distribution channels and
    higher marketing costs, tend to have a higher rate of selling
    expenses. Base business selling expenses increased 5.0%, which
    approximates internal sales growth for 2005.

Corporate administrative expenses were $27.4 million in
    2005, an increase of $3.0 million or 12.3%, when compared
    with 2004. The increase in corporate expenses is the result of
    higher restricted stock amortization expense related to the
    Company’s 2004 change in its long-term incentive
    compensation program, and higher personnel costs necessary to
    grow the Company. The Company expects administrative expenses to
    increase in 2006 due to expected continued growth in the
    business. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative
    expenses were 1.9% in 2005, which is slightly lower than in 2004.

After deducting corporate administrative expenses, consolidated
    operating income was $239.4 million in 2005, an increase of
    $43.2 million or 22.0% when compared with
    $196.2 million in 2004. This represents an operating margin
    of 16.7% of sales for 2005 compared with 15.9% of sales in 2004.

Interest expense was $32.9 million in 2005, an increase of
    16.1% compared with $28.3 million in 2004. The increase was
    due to higher average borrowing levels to fund the 2005
    acquisitions, and higher average interest rates.

The effective tax rate for 2005 was 31.1% compared with 32.0% in
    2004. The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due
    to the realization of tax benefits stemming from the
    Company’s worldwide tax planning activities and other
    adjustments.

Net income for 2005 was $140.6 million, an increase of
    $27.9 million, or 24.8%, from $112.7 million in 2004.
    Diluted earnings per share rose 22.1% to $1.99 per share,
    an increase of $0.36, when compared with $1.63 per diluted
    share in 2004.

Operating
    Segment Results

EIG’s

sales were $808.5 million in 2005, an
    increase of $141.1 or 21.1% from 2004 sales of
    $667.4 million. The sales increase was due to internal
    growth in EIG’s aerospace, process and analytical
    instruments, and industrial markets and the acquisitions of
    Taylor Hobson in 2004 and SPECTRO and Solartron in 2005.
    Internal growth accounted for 4.6% of the 21.1% increase. The
    acquisitions accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.

EIG’s operating income for 2005 increased to
    $166.4 million from $126.4 million in 2004, an
    increase of $40.0 million, or 31.7%. The increase in
    operating income was due to higher sales. Approximately half of
    the



increase in operating income was from the acquisitions mentioned
    above. Both years included one-time pretax gains; 2005 included
    a gain of $4.3 million from the sale of a facility, and
    2004 included a gain of $5.3 million from the settlement of
    an insurance claim. Operating margins of EIG improved to 20.6%
    of sales for 2005 compared with operating margins of 18.9% of
    sales in 2004 due to production efficiencies in the Group’s
    base businesses.

EMG’s

sales for 2005 were $626.0 million, an
    increase of $61.1 million or 10.8%, compared with sales of
    $564.9 million in 2004. The sales increase was due in part
    to internal growth, particularly in the Group’s
    differentiated businesses, which accounted for 4.2% of the 10.8%
    sales increase. The acquisitions of Hughes-Treitler in 2004 and
    HCC in October 2005 as well as $2.3 million of favorable
    foreign currency translation effects accounted for the remainder
    of the sales increase.

EMG’s operating income for 2005 increased to
    $100.3 million from $94.3 million in 2004, an increase
    of $6.0 million or 6.4%. EMG’s increase in operating
    income was due to higher sales from its differentiated
    businesses, which include the recent acquisitions mentioned
    above. Operating margins of EMG were 16.0% of sales in 2005
    compared with operating margins of 16.7% of sales in 2004. The
    decrease in operating margins was the result of unfavorable
    changes in product mix within the Group’s cost-driven motor
    businesses.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2004, Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2003

Results
    of Operations

In 2004, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
    income, and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved
    these results from an improving economy, internal growth in its
    EIG and EMG groups, acquisitions and cost reduction programs.
    The Company experienced improved market conditions in most of
    its businesses in 2004. Sales and orders continued to benefit
    from the broad-based economic improvement impacting the
    Company’s short-cycle businesses as well as improvement in
    its long-cycle aerospace business. The Company’s
    cost-driven floor care and specialty motors businesses were
    mainly flat in 2004.

The Company reported sales for 2004 of $1,232.3 million, an
    increase of $140.7 million or 12.9% from sales of
    $1,091.6 million in 2003. Net sales for EIG were
    $667.4 million in 2004, an increase of 18.8% from sales of
    $561.9 million in 2003. The 2004 sales increase for EIG was
    driven by the acquisitions of Taylor Hobson in June 2004 and
    Chandler Instruments in August 2003. Strength in the high-end
    analytical instruments business, the heavy-vehicle instruments
    business, and the aerospace and power businesses also
    contributed to the increase. Net sales for EMG were
    $564.9 million in 2004, an increase of 6.6% from sales of
    $529.7 million in 2003 primarily driven by strength in its
    differentiated businesses and the acquisition of Hughes-Treitler
    in July 2004. The Group’s cost-driven floor care and
    specialty motors businesses were mainly flat in 2004.
    Strengthening foreign currencies also contributed
    $22.5 million to the overall sales increase, primarily from
    the British pound and the euro. The noted acquisitions increased
    2004 sales by $53.6 million or 4.3%.

Total international sales for 2004 increased to
    $536.5 million or 43.5% of consolidated sales, an increase
    of $100.8 million when compared with $435.7 million or
    39.9% of sales in 2003. The increase in international sales
    primarily resulted from the acquisitions previously mentioned as
    well as increased international sales from base businesses.
    Export shipments from the United States, which are included in
    total international sales, were $232.0 million in 2004, an
    increase of 15.5% compared with $200.8 million in 2003.

New orders for 2004 were $1,287.0 million, compared with
    $1,136.9 million for 2003, an increase of
    $150.1 million or 13.2%. The order backlog at
    December 31, 2004 was $340.9 million, compared with
    $286.2 million at December 31, 2003, an increase of
    $54.7 million or 19.1%. The increase in orders and backlog
    was due mainly to the two acquisitions completed in 2004 along
    with increased order levels primarily in the Company’s
    differentiated businesses.

Segment operating income was $220.6 million for 2004, an
    increase of 23.2%, compared with segment operating income of
    $179.1 million for 2003. Segment operating margins in 2004
    were 17.9% of sales, an increase from 16.4% of sales in 2003.
    The increase in segment operating income resulted from higher
    sales from the Company’s differentiated businesses.
    Approximately half of the increase in operating income was from
    the recent acquisitions. The increase in segment operating
    margins came from improved performance by the Company’s



differentiated businesses. Segment operating income for 2004
    also included a $5.3 million pretax gain from the
    settlement of a flood insurance claim involving a manufacturing
    plant.

SG&A expenses were $135.5 million in 2004, compared
    with $115.2 million in 2003, an increase of
    $20.3 million or 17.6%. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
    expenses were 11.0% in 2004, compared with 10.6% in 2003.
    Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 9.1% in
    2004, compared to 8.5% in 2003. The selling expense increase,
    and the corresponding increase as a percentage of sales, was due
    primarily to the acquired businesses. The acquisitions added
    1.2% to selling expense in 2004 as a percentage of sales. The
    Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire
    differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution
    channels and higher marketing costs tend to have higher selling
    expenses. Selling expense, as a percentage of sales by base
    businesses was lower when compared with 2003, reflecting the
    Company’s focus on cost reduction initiatives as a part of
    its Operational Excellence strategy.

Corporate administrative expenses were $24.4 million in
    2004, an increase of $2.0 million or 9.0%, when compared
    with 2003. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative
    expenses were 2.0% in 2004, which was unchanged from 2003. The
    increase in 2004 corporate expenses was primarily the result of
    higher legal, professional and consulting fees as well as higher
    overall compensation expenses. The higher professional and
    consulting fees were primarily the result of the Company’s
    Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiatives associated with reporting
    on the Company’s internal controls for 2004. Corporate
    administrative expenses in 2003 included a $2.1 million
    one-time, noncash expense, from the accelerated cost recognition
    due to the vesting of a restricted stock grant.

After deducting corporate administrative expenses, consolidated
    operating income was $196.2 million, an increase of
    $39.4 million or 25.2% when compared with
    $156.8 million in 2003. This represented an operating
    margin of 15.9% of sales for 2004 compared with 14.4% of sales
    in 2003.

Interest expense was $28.3 million in 2004, an increase of
    8.9% compared with $26.0 million in 2003. The increase was
    due to higher average interest rates on British pound borrowings
    incurred in connection with acquisitions in the United Kingdom
    in 2004 and 2003. Other expenses increased by $1.5 million,
    to $2.1 million in 2004 as a result of broad increases in
    non-operating expenses, including bank fees and expenses
    associated with acquisitions not consummated.

The effective tax rate for 2004 was 32.0% compared with 32.5% in
    2003. The tax rate in 2004 reflected higher tax benefits in
    connection with U.S. export sales. The 2003 tax rate
    reflected the nondeductibility of the noncash expense from the
    acceleration of restricted stock expense, mentioned earlier.

Net income for 2004 was $112.7 million, an increase of
    $24.9 million, or 28.4%, from $87.8 million in 2003.
    Diluted earnings per share rose 25.4% to $1.63 per share,
    an increase of $0.33, when compared with $1.30 per diluted
    share in 2003.

Operating
    Segment Results

EIG’s

sales were $667.4 million in 2004, an
    increase of 18.8% from 2003 sales of $561.9 million. The
    sales increase was primarily from the 2004 Taylor Hobson
    acquisition and the 2003 Chandler Instruments acquisition,
    internal sales growth from strength in the Group’s high-end
    analytical instrumentation, heavy-vehicle, and aerospace
    businesses as well as a favorable foreign currency translation
    impact of $7.4 million. The acquisitions increased 2004
    group sales by $62.5 million or 9.4%.

EIG’s operating income for 2004 increased to
    $126.4 million from $95.0 million in 2003, an increase
    of $31.4 million, or 33.1%. The increase in operating
    income was driven by higher sales. The recent acquisitions
    accounted for approximately half of the operating income
    increase. Operating income for EIG for 2004 also included a
    $5.3 million pretax gain from the insurance settlement of a
    flood claim at one of the Group’s manufacturing plants. The
    flood gain resulted from the finalization of the Company’s
    claim for damage to the building, its contents, and the
    operating assets affected by the flood as well as settlement of
    business interruption and other expenses. As a result of the
    flood, the Company ceased operations at this site. Operating
    margins of EIG improved to 18.9% of sales for 2004 compared with
    operating margins of 16.9% of sales in 2003.



EMG’s

sales for 2004 were $564.9 million, an
    increase of $35.2 million or 6.6%, compared with sales of
    $529.7 million in 2003. The sales increase was a result of
    the Hughes-Treitler acquisition and $15.1 million of
    favorable foreign currency translation effects as well as
    strength in the Group’s differentiated businesses. The
    Group’s cost-driven floor care and specialty motors
    businesses were mainly flat in 2004. The Hughes-Treitler
    acquisition accounted for approximately 2.6% of the Group’s
    sales increase.

EMG’s operating income for 2004 increased to
    $94.3 million from $84.2 million in 2003, an increase
    of $10.1 million or 12.0%. The increase in operating income
    was the result of higher sales by the Group’s
    differentiated businesses, including the acquisition mentioned
    above, which accounted for approximately one-third of the
    increase. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the group incurred
    $2.5 million of expense related to severance and the
    acceleration of depreciation expense associated with the planned
    movement of production to low-cost manufacturing locales. The
    Group’s operating margins for 2004 improved to 16.7% of
    sales compared with operating margins of 15.9% of sales in 2003,
    due to the strength in the Group’s differentiated
    businesses.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $165.9 million for 2005, compared with $161.3 million
    in 2004, an increase of $4.6 million, or 2.9%. The increase
    in operating cash flow was primarily the result of higher
    earnings, partially offset by higher overall operating working
    capital requirements, mainly driven by the growth of the
    Company’s business to meet the increased sales levels. In
    2005, the Company contributed $10.8 million to its defined
    benefit pension plans compared with $6.1 million
    contributed in 2004. During 2004, the Company’s operating
    activities also included $13.8 million of net cash from
    insurance proceeds and refunds from prior years’ tax
    returns. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital
    spending) was $142.6 million in 2005, slightly higher than
    in 2004. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes,
    depreciation and amortization) was $275.8 million in 2005,
    compared with $233.4 million in 2004, an 18.2% improvement.
    Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is
    aware that they are measures that are used by third parties in
    evaluating the Company. (See table on page 16 for a
    reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP
    measures).

Cash used for investing activities was $361.8 million for
    2005, compared with $154.5 million in 2004. In 2005, the
    Company acquired SPECTRO for $97.7 million in cash,
    Solartron for $76.9 million in cash, and HCC for
    $163.6 million in cash (each is net of cash received). In
    addition, the Company acquired two small technology lines for
    cash, bringing the total cash outlay for acquisitions in 2005 to
    $340.7 million, including transaction costs, and net of
    cash received with the acquisitions. In 2004, the Company
    acquired Taylor Hobson and Hughes-Treitler for
    $143.5 million of cash, net of cash received. Additions to
    property, plant and equipment totaled $23.3 million in
    2005, compared with $21.0 million in 2004.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled
    $196.8 million in 2005, compared with $15.5 million in
    2004. In 2005, total borrowings, net of repayments, increased by
    $197.5 million, compared with a net increase of
    $15.5 million in 2004. The net increase in long-term
    borrowings was $91.8 million in 2005 compared with a net
    increase of $71.1 million in 2004. Short-term borrowings
    increased $105.7 million in 2005, compared with a decrease
    of $55.6 million in 2004. In 2005, long-term borrowings
    included a new 50 million euro ($59.2 million)
    ten-year term loan, which was completed in the third quarter of
    2005, to finance the acquisition of SPECTRO. Additionally,
    21.5 million British pounds (approximately
    $37.0 million) was outstanding at December 31, 2005
    related to a floating term loan due in annual installments over
    a

5-year

period to finance a portion of the price to purchase Solartron
    in September 2005, along with $162.0 million borrowed under
    the Company’s $300 million revolving credit facility
    and the accounts receivable securitization program to acquire
    HCC in October 2005. The euro and British pound borrowings
    provide natural hedges of the Company’s investment in the
    German-based SPECTRO business and the United Kingdom-based
    Solartron business. The Company had available borrowing capacity
    of $201.9 million under its $300 million revolving
    bank credit facility, and had fully utilized its
    $75.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility
    at December 31, 2005. The revolving bank credit facility
    was amended in June 2005 to extend its expiration date from
    February 2009 to June 2010. The amendment also lowered the
    Company’s cost of capital, reduced the number of financial
    covenants required, and eased or removed other financial
    restrictions. It also added an “accordion feature”
    that permits the Company to request up to an additional
    $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time
    during the term of the revolving credit



agreement. Extension of the credit facility provides the Company
    with increased flexibility to support its growth plans.

At December 31, 2005, total debt outstanding was
    $631.4 million compared with $450.1 million at
    December 31, 2004. The

debt-to-capital

ratio was 43.9% at December 31, 2005, compared with 40.6%
    at December 31, 2004. The increased

debt-to-capital

ratio was the result of the additional borrowing used to
    partially finance the 2005 acquisitions. The Company’s debt
    agreements contain various covenants including limitations on
    indebtedness and dividend payments, and maintenance of certain
    financial ratios. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
    Company was in compliance with the debt covenants.

In 2005, net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock
    options were $16.2 million, essentially unchanged from
    2004. Cash dividends paid in 2005 were $16.8 million,
    comparable to the amount paid in 2004.

There were no repurchases of the Company’s common stock in
    2005 or 2004. As of December 31, 2005, $52.4 million
    was available, under the current Board authorization, for future
    share repurchases.

The following table summarizes AMETEK’s contractual cash
    obligations at December 31, 2005, and the effect such
    obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity
    and cash flows in future years.

Other
    Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of
    approximately $31.5 million related to performance and
    payment guarantees. Based on experience with these arrangements,
    the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will
    not be material to its financial position.

Although it has not done so in recent years, the Company may,
    from time to time, redeem, tender for, or repurchase its
    long-term debt in the open market or in privately negotiated
    transactions depending upon availability, market conditions and
    other factors.

As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in
    2005, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2005
    totaled $35.5 million, compared with $37.6 million at
    December 31, 2004. The Company believes it has



sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and
    unrestricted foreign sources, and available financing
    alternatives, to enable it to meet operating needs and
    contractual commitments.

Transactions
    with Related Parties

A member of the Company’s Board of Directors is also of
    counsel to the law firm of Stroock & Stroock &
    Lavan LLP, with which the Company has a business relationship.
    In 2005, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP billed
    fees to the Company in the aggregate for services rendered,
    primarily related to business acquisitions, of $1,438,000.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its most critical accounting policies
    as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact
    on the presentation of the Company’s financial condition
    and results of operations, and that require the use of complex
    and subjective estimates based upon past experience and
    management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent
    in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the
    estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and
    related notes contain information that is pertinent to the
    Company’s accounting policies and to management’s
    discussion and analysis. The information that follows represents
    additional specific disclosures about the Company’s
    accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective
    decisions, or assessments whereby materially different results
    of operations and financial condition could have been reported
    had different assumptions been used or different conditions
    existed. Primary disclosure of the Company’s significant
    accounting policies is in Note 1 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements,” included elsewhere in
    this report.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is
    complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the
    customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under
    which title and risk of loss have been transferred,
    collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or
    determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and
    risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue
    upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for
    revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect to sales
    returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may
    not return products or be given allowances, except at the
    Company’s option. We have agreements with distributors that
    do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products.
    The distributor purchases the product from the Company at which
    time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The
    Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits
    to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company
    accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when
    the sale is recognized in the statement of income. Accruals for
    sales returns, other allowances, and estimated warranty costs
    are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience.
    At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the accrual for future
    warranty obligations was $9.4 million, $7.3 million
    and $6.9 million, respectively. Acquisitions primarily
    accounted for the increase in 2005. The Company’s expense
    for warranty obligations approximated $7.2 million in 2005
    and $5.0 million each year in 2004 and 2003. The warranty
    periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s
    operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The
    Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past
    warranty experience, and adjustments are made periodically to
    reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales
    returns, allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past
    experience, additional warranty accruals may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains
    allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
    specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the
    Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against
    the amount due from these customers. For all other customers,
    the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the
    length of time specific receivables are past due based on its
    historical experience. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their
    inability to make payments, additional allowances may be
    required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $7.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004.



•

Inventories.

The Company uses the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for approximately 50% of
    its inventories. The

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method, which approximates current replacement
    cost, is used to determine cost for the remainder. For
    inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the
    excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO value was approximately
    $28.4 million and $28.8 million at December 31,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company provides estimated
    inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based
    on current assessments about future demand, market conditions,
    customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties, and
    related management initiatives. If these factors are less
    favorable than those projected by management, additional
    inventory reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill.

The Company accounts for goodwill
    under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.

Under SFAS 142, goodwill is not
    amortized; rather, it is tested for impairment at least annually.

SFAS 142 requires a two-step impairment test for goodwill.
    The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the
    Company’s reporting unit’s assets to the fair value of
    the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying
    value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss
    is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value,
    then the second step must be completed, which involves
    allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset
    and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An
    impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill
    exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to
    record such impairment losses. The determination of the fair
    value of the Company’s reporting units is based, among
    other things, on estimates of future operating performance of
    the reporting unit being valued. Changes in interest rates and
    market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on
    these estimates. The Company’s acquisitions have generally
    included a large goodwill component and the Company expects to
    continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2005,
    goodwill totaled $785.2 million or 44.1% of the
    Company’s total assets. The Company performed its required
    annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005 and
    determined that the Company’s goodwill was not impaired.
    There can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not
    occur in the future.

•

Pensions.

U.S. Defined
    Benefit Plans

The Company has defined benefit and defined contribution pension
    plans. AMETEK accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in
    accordance with SFAS 87,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions

, which requires that amounts recognized in the
    financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. The
    accounting requirements have no effect on funding of the pension
    plans. The most significant elements in determining the
    Company’s pension income or expense are the assumed pension
    liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets.
    The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at
    which the pension liabilities could be settled at the year-end
    valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines
    the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan
    liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2005, the Company
    considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income
    investments. The discount rate used in determining the 2005
    pension cost was 5.75% for U.S. defined benefit pension
    plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status
    of the plans at December 31, 2005, and determining the 2006
    U.S. defined benefit pension plan cost is 5.65%. In
    estimating this rate, the Company’s actuaries developed a
    customized discount rate appropriate to the plans’
    projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a
    database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The
    Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    for U.S. defined benefit pension plans for 2005 of 8.5% and
    will use an expected long-term rate of 8.25% for 2006. The
    Company determines its expected long-term rate of return based
    primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension
    plans’ investments. Additionally, the Company considers
    historical returns on comparable fixed- income investments and
    equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed
    appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in
    determining the 2005 and 2006 pension expense for these plans
    was 3.5%. The unrecognized pension loss, which results from the
    net effect of changes in the assumed discount rate, the effect
    of differences between the expected return and the actual return
    on plan assets, and other changes in actuarial assumptions, has
    been deferred and is subject to



amortization over the estimated service periods of the
    participants. The unrecognized pension loss totaled
    $77.5 million for U.S. defined benefit pension plans
    at December 31, 2005, compared with $67.2 million at
    December 31, 2004. Depending on the impact of potential
    future changes in actuarial assumptions, the deferred loss could
    possibly affect future pension expense under current accounting
    rules.

U.S. and
    Foreign Defined Benefit Plans

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
    recognized consolidated pretax pension expense under
    SFAS 87 of $2.1 million from its U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit pension plans. This compares with pretax pension
    expense under SFAS 87 of $2.6 million recognized from
    these plans in 2004.

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its
    defined benefit pension plans during 2005 which totaled
    $10.8 million, compared with $6.1 million in 2004. The
    Company anticipates making cash contributions of approximately
    $12 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2006.

New
    Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

, a revision to SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
    for Stock Based Compensation

and superseding Accounting
    Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires the Company to expense the
    fair value of grants made under its employee stock award plans.
    That cost will be recognized over the required service period of
    the grants. SFAS No. 123(R) permits companies to adopt
    its requirements using either a “modified prospective”
    method, or a “modified retrospective” method.
    Following adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amounts
    previously disclosed on a pro forma basis under
    SFAS No. 123 are to be recorded in the consolidated
    statement of income. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company
    accounted for share-based payments to employees using the
    intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25.
    The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) effective
    January 1, 2006, under the modified retrospective method
    with retroactive restatement for all prior periods presented
    using the pro forma amounts disclosed in note 10 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Had the Company
    adopted SFAS 123R in prior years, the impact of its
    adoption would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123, as
    shown in the pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per
    share on page 49. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
    is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by
    approximately $0.05 for 2006 and $0.05 per share on a
    restated basis for 2005.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4.

SFAS No. 151 amends the
    guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
    Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of
    idle facility expense, handling costs and wasted material
    (spoilage). Among other provisions, the new rule requires that
    such items be recognized as current-period charges.
    SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt
    SFAS No. 151 effective January 1, 2006 and does
    not expect that its adoption will have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
    position or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154

,
    Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — a
    replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
    No. 3.

SFAS No. 154 establishes retrospective
    application as the required method for reporting voluntary
    changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable, in
    which case the changes should be applied to the earliest
    practicable date presented. SFAS No. 154 also requires
    that a correction of an error be reported as a prior period
    adjustment by restating prior period financial statements.
    SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and
    corrections of errors, if any, beginning January 1, 2006.

Internal
    Reinvestment

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $23.3 million or 1.6% of sales in
    2005, compared with $21.0 million or 1.7% of sales in 2004.
    Approximately 54% of the expenditures in 2005 were for equipment
    to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Company’s
    2006 capital expenditures are expected to increase when compared
    with 2005



levels, with a continuing emphasis on spending to improve
    productivity and expand low-cost manufacturing facilities. For
    2006, capital expenditures are expected to approximate 2% of
    sales.

Product
    Development and Engineering

Product development and engineering expenses are directed toward
    the development and improvement of new and existing products and
    processes. Such expenses before customer reimbursement were
    $75.9 million in 2005, an increase from $66.0 million
    in 2004, and $56.1 million in 2003. Customer reimbursements
    were $8.9 million, $6.2 million, and $6.2 million
    in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in the amounts
    above are net expenses for research and development of
    $34.8 million for 2005, $25.5 million for 2004, and
    $21.4 million for 2003.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
    existing at that time, the Company has been named a Potentially
    Responsible Party (PRP) at 20

non-AMETEK

owned sites. The Company is identified as a
    “de-minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the
    low volume of relative waste attributed to the Company. In 10 of
    these sites, the Company has reached agreement on the cost of
    the de-minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is
    awaiting executed agreements. The agreed to settlement amounts
    are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is
    continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
    attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
    responsible for remedial activity at the site to establish an
    appropriate settlement amount. In the six remaining sites where
    the Company is a non-de-minimis PRP, the Company is
    participating in the investigation and/or related required
    remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been
    established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s expected
    obligation. The Company historically has resolved these issues
    within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this
    result will continue. In addition to these

non-AMETEK

owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing
    reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its
    current or previously owned manufacturing locations and for
    claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other
    environmental matters once the Company has determined that a
    loss is probable and estimable. Total environmental reserves at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $6.8 million and
    $7.3 million, respectively. The Company spent
    $1.0 million on such environmental matters in 2005 and
    2004. The Company also has agreements with former owners of
    certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
    previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements,
    the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to
    indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other
    liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
    the other parties carry insurance coverage for some
    environmental matters. To date, those parties have met their
    obligations in all material respects. The Company has no reason
    to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their
    obligations in the future. However, if the Company were required
    to record a liability with respect to all, or a portion of, such
    matters on its balance sheet, the effect on income and the
    amount of the liability could be significant. In the opinion of
    management, based upon presently available information and past
    experience related to such matters, either adequate provision
    for probable costs has been made, or the ultimate cost resulting
    from these actions is not expected to materially affect the
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows of the Company.

Market
    Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are
    fluctuations in interest rates on its short-term and long-term
    debt, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for
    certain raw material purchases.

Most of the Company’s long-term debt carries fixed rates
    and its short-term debt is variable-rate debt. These financial
    instruments are more fully described in the notes to the
    financial statements.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most
    significant exchange rate exposure include the euro, the British
    pound, the Mexican peso and the Japanese yen. Exposure to
    foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when
    possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and the
    occasional use of derivative financial instruments. The effect
    of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into
    U.S. dollars is included in



other comprehensive income, within stockholders’ equity.
    Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect
    on the operating results reported by the Company because
    revenues and the manufacturing and selling costs associated with
    those revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign
    currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure
    are raw material purchases of nickel, copper and steel. Exposure
    to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated
    through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product,
    and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward
    contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest
    rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or commodity prices, the
    potential losses in future earnings, fair value of
    risk-sensitive financial instruments, and cash flows are not
    material, although the actual effects may differ materially from
    the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain matters discussed in this

Form 10-K

are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995, which
    involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Company’s
    operations and business environment, and can be affected by
    inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and
    uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in
    determining the Company’s actual future results. The
    Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor”
    provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous
    important factors in some cases have caused, and in the future
    could cause, the Company’s actual results to differ
    materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
    statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not
    all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ from present expectations are set forth under
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

REPORTS
    OF MANAGEMENT

Management’s
    Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
    the consolidated financial statements and related information.
    The statements are prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently
    applied and include certain amounts based on management’s
    best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
    elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
    financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
    financial information, management maintains a system of internal
    accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
    program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
    division of responsibility and the application of written
    policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
    reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
    preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
    of internal controls, although there are inherent limitations in
    the effectiveness of any system of internal controls that is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and
    reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated
    financial statements.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
    Company’s activities according to the highest standards of
    personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
    characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
    all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
    Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
    other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
    Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
    firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
    that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
    report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
    of the Company for its 2006 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
    registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
    direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an
    opinion as to whether management’s financial statements
    present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s
    financial position and operating results. That report appears on
    page 32.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in the Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on the
    framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that
    evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2005.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, which appears on page 31.

AMETEK, Inc.

March 1, 2006



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting

(which appears on page 30), that
    AMETEK, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
    criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that AMETEK, Inc.
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
    AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2005, and our report dated March 1, 2006
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
    stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2005 and
    2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
    criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated March 1, 2006 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis of
    Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
    operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
    (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the
    Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant
    intercompany transactions in the consolidation. The
    Company’s investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures
    are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Such
    investments are not significant to the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
    reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
    Equivalents, Securities, and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
    less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, all of the Company’s
    equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those
    of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as
    “available for sale”, although the Company may hold
    fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income
    securities generally mature within four years. The aggregate
    market value of equity and fixed-income securities at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $15.7 million
    ($15.2 million amortized cost), and $18.7 million
    ($16.8 million amortized cost), respectively. The temporary
    unrealized gain or loss on such securities is recorded as a
    separate component of other comprehensive income (in
    stockholders’ equity), and is not material. The Company had
    no

other-than-temporary

impairment losses in 2005 or 2004. The Company recognized

other-than-temporary

impairment losses against earnings of $0.7 million in 2003.
    Certain of the Company’s other investments are accounted
    for by the equity method, and as discussed previously, are not
    significant.

Accounts
    Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
    from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
    obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
    receivables is recorded against the amount due from these
    customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
    reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
    specific receivables are past due based on its past experience.
    The allowance for possible losses on receivables at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $7.6 million. See
    Note 6.

Inventories

The Company uses the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for approximately 50% of
    its inventories. The

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method, which approximates current replacement
    cost, is used to determine cost for the remaining 50% of the
    inventories. For inventories where cost is determined by the
    LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO value
    was approximately $28.4 million and $28.8 million at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company
    provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and
    obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future
    demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing
    financial difficulties, and related management initiatives. If
    these factors are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional inventory reserves may be required.



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
    for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
    lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies,
    and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
    incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
    principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable
    assets is generally 5 to 10 years for machinery and
    equipment, and 25 to 40 years for buildings.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
    when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when
    products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of
    an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have
    been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of
    sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery,
    we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all
    other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with
    respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that
    the customer may not return products or be given allowances,
    except at the Company’s option. We have agreements with
    distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for
    unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the
    Company at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the
    distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
    incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume
    discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a
    reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the income
    statement. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances, and
    estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment
    based upon past experience. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003, the accrual for future warranty obligations was
    $9.4 million, $7.3 million and $6.9 million,
    respectively. The Company’s expense for warranty
    obligations approximated $7.2 million in 2005 and
    $5.0 million each year in 2004 and 2003. The warranty
    periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s
    operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The
    Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past
    warranty experience, and adjustments are made periodically to
    reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales
    returns, allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past
    experience, additional warranty accruals may be required.

Research
    and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
    operations as incurred and during the past three years were:
    2005-$34.8 million, 2004-$25.5 million and
    2003-$21.4 million.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, and
    were: 2005 - $20.0 million,
    2004 - $16.5 million, and
    2003 - $14.7 million.

Earnings
    per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the
    effect of all potentially dilutive securities (primarily
    outstanding common stock options and restricted stock). The
    following table presents the number of shares used in the
    calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per
    share:

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Financial
    Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
    using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and
    their results of operations are translated using average
    exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company
    and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their
    functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those
    transactions generally are included in operating results for the
    year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
    instruments. Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into
    from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain
    inventory purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the
    Company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuation. No
    forward contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2005.
    One insignificant forward contract for the purchase of certain
    inventories was outstanding at December 31, 2004. In
    instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an
    underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are
    included in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) (within
    stockholders’ equity) to the extent they are effective as
    hedges. The Company has designated certain
    foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of the net
    investment in certain foreign operations. These net investment
    hedges relate to the Company’s British-pound-denominated
    long-term debt and euro-denominated long-term debt pertaining to
    the Company’s acquisition of Solartron in September 2005,
    Taylor Hobson in June 2004, and Airtechnology in January 2003,
    which are U.K.-based businesses, and the SPECTRO  business,
    which was acquired in June 2005, and is a German-based business.
    These acquisitions were financed by borrowings under
    AMETEK’s revolving credit facility and subsequently
    refinanced in the form of long-term debt outside of the
    revolving credit facility. These borrowings were designed to
    create natural net investment hedges in each of the foreign
    subsidiaries mentioned on their respective dates of acquisition.
    SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

, permits hedging the foreign currency
    exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. In
    accordance with SFAS 133, on the respective dates of
    acquisition, the Company designated the British pound- and
    euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments
    to offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the net investment
    in the acquired business due to changes in the British pound and
    euro exchange rates. As required by SFAS 133, any gain or
    loss on the hedging instrument following hedge designation (the
    debt), is reported in OCI in the same manner as the translation
    adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate,
    which is used to measure hedge effectiveness. As of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, all net investment hedges were
    effective. At December 31, 2005, the translation gains on
    the net carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated
    investments exceeded the translation losses on the carrying
    value of the underlying debt and are included in OCI. An
    evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company on
    an ongoing basis.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had
    $191.8 million and $172.7 million, respectively, of
    British pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge
    against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in
    2005, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2005, the Company had
    $59.2 million of euro-denominated loans, which were
    designated as a hedge against the net investment in a foreign
    subsidiary acquired in 2005. As a result of these British pound-
    and euro-denominated loans being designated and effective as net
    investment hedges, approximately $20.5 million of currency
    gains and $10.1 million of currency losses have been
    included in the translation adjustment in OCI at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

and SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosures

, which amends SFAS 123, encourage entities
    to recognize compensation expense for stock-based employee
    compensation plans at fair value, but provide the option of
    measuring compensation expense using the intrinsic value method
    prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25).
    The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with APB 25. The exercise price of stock options, set at
    the time of the grant, is not less than the fair market value
    per share at the date of the grant. Had the Company applied the
    fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, pretax
    stock-based compensation expense would have increased
    $5.9 million, $5.1 million, and



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$4.9 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
    Diluted earnings per share would have been lower by $0.05 for
    2005, and $0.04 in 2004 and 2003. Options generally have a
    four-year full vesting period from date of grant. Note 10
    presents pro forma results of operations as if the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123 had been used to account
    for stock-based compensation plans.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible
    assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets.

Under SFAS 142, purchased
    goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives,
    primarily trademarks and tradenames, are not amortized; rather,
    they are tested for impairment at least annually.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives will
    continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Patents are
    being amortized over useful lives of 5 to 17 years.
    Customer relationships are being amortized over a period of 15
    to 20 years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are
    being amortized over a period of 10 to 20 years. The
    Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful
    lives of these intangible assets.

In order to test goodwill and other intangible assets with
    indefinite lives for impairment under SFAS 142, a
    determination of the fair value of the Company’s reporting
    units for its goodwill valuation, and its other intangible
    assets with indefinite lives is required and is based upon,
    among other things, estimates of future operating performance of
    the reporting unit being valued. Changes in market conditions,
    among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. The
    Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the
    fourth quarter of 2005, 2004 and 2003 and determined that the
    carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with
    indefinite lives was not impaired.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts appearing in the prior year’s financial
    statements and supporting footnote disclosures have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Stock
    Split

On January 27, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a

two-for-one

split of its common stock distributed on February 27, 2004,
    to shareholders of record on February 13, 2004. All share
    and per share amounts included in this report reflect the impact
    of the stock split.

Accounting
    Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, a revision to
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock Based
    Compensation

and superseding Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees.

SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires the Company to expense the fair value of grants made
    under its employee stock award plans. That cost will be
    recognized over the required service period of the grants.
    SFAS No. 123(R) permits companies to adopt its
    requirements using either a “modified prospective”
    method, or a “modified retrospective” method.
    Following adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amounts
    previously disclosed on a pro forma basis under
    SFAS No. 123 are to be recorded in the consolidated
    statement of income. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company
    accounted for share-based payments to employees using the
    intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25.
    The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) effective
    January 1, 2006, under the modified retrospective method
    with retroactive restatement for all prior periods presented
    using the pro forma amounts disclosed in Note 10 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Had the Company
    adopted SFAS 123R in prior years, the impact of its
    adoption would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123, as
    shown in the pro forma disclosure of net

    Inc.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

income and earnings per share on page 49. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) is expected to reduce diluted earnings
    per share by approximately $0.05 for 2006 and $0.05 per
    share on a restated basis for 2005.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4.

SFAS No. 151 amends the
    guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
    Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of
    idle facility expense, handling costs and wasted material
    (spoilage). Among other provisions, the new rule requires that
    such items be recognized as current-period charges.
    SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt
    SFAS No. 151 effective January 1, 2006 and does
    not expect that its adoption will have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
    position or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154

,
    Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — a
    replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
    No. 3.

SFAS No. 154 establishes
    retrospective application as the required method for reporting
    voluntary changes in accounting principle, unless it is
    impracticable, in which case the changes should be applied to
    the earliest practicable date presented. SFAS No. 154
    also requires that a correction of an error be reported as a
    prior period adjustment by restating prior period financial
    statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting
    changes and corrections of errors, if any, beginning
    January 1, 2006.

Acquisitions

In October 2005, the Company acquired HCC Industries
    (“HCC”) from an investor group led by Windward Capital
    Partners and management for approximately $162 million in
    cash, net of cash received. Additionally, with the acquisition
    of HCC, the Company assumed specified contingent liabilities,
    for which the Company believes it is fully indemnified, arising
    out of certain previous business activities of HCC. HCC is a
    leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered hermetic
    connectors, terminals, headers and microelectronic packages for
    sophisticated electronic applications in the aerospace, defense,
    industrial and petrochemical markets. Headquartered near Los
    Angeles, CA, HCC has annual sales of approximately
    $104 million. HCC is part of the Company’s
    Electromechanical Group.

In September 2005, the Company acquired the Solartron Group
    (“Solartron”) from Roxboro Group PLC for approximately
    42 million British pounds, or $75 million in cash, net
    of cash received. United Kingdom-based Solartron is a leading
    supplier of analytical instrumentation for the process,
    laboratory, and other industrial markets, with annual sales of
    approximately 27 million British pounds, or
    $50 million. Solartron is part of the Company’s
    Electronic Instruments Group.

In June 2005, the Company acquired SPECTRO Beteiligungs GmbH
    (“SPECTRO”), the holding company of SPECTRO Analytical
    Instruments GmbH & Co. KG and its affiliates, from an
    investor group led by German Equity Partners BV for
    approximately 80 million euros, or $96.9 million in
    cash, net of cash received. SPECTRO is a leading global supplier
    of atomic spectroscopy analytical instrumentation. Headquartered
    in Kleve, Germany, SPECTRO has annualized sales of
    85 million euros, or $104 million. SPECTRO is a part
    of the Company’s Electronic Instruments Group.

The operating results of the HCC, Solartron and SPECTRO
    acquisitions are included in the Company’s consolidated
    results from the dates of acquisition.

In the second and third quarters of 2005, the Company also
    purchased two small technology lines for cash. The technologies
    acquired are individually related to the Company’s
    brushless DC motor and precision pumping system businesses in
    its Electromechanical and Electronic Instruments Groups,
    respectively.

    production of hermetic (moisture-proof) connectors, terminals,
    headers and microelectronic packages for customer-specific
    applications. The Solartron acquisition broadens the
    Company’s analytical instrumentation product offerings for
    the process, laboratory and other industrial markets, expanding
    its geographic reach and capitalizing on significant synergies
    with the Company’s existing businesses. The benefits the
    Company expects to realize from the SPECTRO acquisition include
    the expansion of its elemental analysis capabilities in metal
    production and processing, environmental testing, hydrocarbon
    processing, aerospace, food processing, and pharmaceutical
    markets. The technology acquisitions provide additional avenues
    for internal growth. The Company does not expect the majority of
    the goodwill recorded on the 2005 acquisitions will be
    deductible for tax purposes.

The $40.0 million assigned to other intangible assets
    consists primarily of patents and technology with estimated
    lives ranging from 6 to 15 years.

For the HCC, Solartron and SPECTRO acquisitions, the Company is
    in the process of completing third party valuations of certain
    tangible and intangible assets acquired and updating its
    assessment of the acquired contingent liabilities of HCC.
    Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired
    assets and liabilities of these businesses is subject to
    revision.

In 2004, the Company made two acquisitions. In June 2004,
    the Company acquired Taylor Hobson Holdings Limited (Taylor
    Hobson) for approximately 51.0 million British pounds, or
    $93.8 million in cash, net of cash received. Taylor Hobson
    is a leading manufacturer of ultraprecise measurement
    instrumentation for a variety of markets, including optics,
    semiconductors, hard disk drives and nanotechnology research.
    Taylor Hobson is a part of the Company’s Electronic
    Instruments Group. In July 2004, the Company acquired
    substantially all of the assets of Hughes-Treitler Mfg. Corp.
    (Hughes-Treitler) for approximately $48.0 million in cash.
    Hughes-Treitler is a supplier of heat exchangers and thermal
    management subsystems for the aerospace and defense markets.
    Hughes-Treitler is a part of the Company’s
    Electromechanical Group.

Had the acquisitions of Taylor Hobson and Hughes-Treitler, which
    were acquired in June and July of 2004, respectively, and HCC,
    SPECTRO and Solartron, which were acquired in June, September
    and October 2005, respectively, been made at the beginning of
    2004, pro forma net sales, net income, and diluted earnings per

    the Company acquired Airtechnology Holdings Limited
    (Airtechnology) from Candover Partners Limited, for
    approximately 50 million British pounds, or about
    $80 million in cash. Airtechnology is a supplier of motors,
    fans and environmental control systems for the aerospace and
    defense markets. Airtechnology is a part of the Company’s
    Electromechanical Group. In February 2003, the Company acquired
    Solidstate Controls, Inc. (SCI) from Marmon Industrial Companies
    LLC for approximately $34 million in cash. SCI is a leading
    supplier of uninterruptible power supply systems for the process
    and power generation industries. SCI is a part of the
    Company’s Electronic Instruments Group. In August 2003, the
    Company acquired Chandler Instruments Company, LLC (Chandler
    Instruments), for approximately $49 million in cash.

Flood
    Damage Gain

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company settled an insurance
    claim in connection with a flood loss, which occurred at one of
    its manufacturing plants in 2003. The Company received insurance
    proceeds totaling $24.2 million in settlement of the damage
    claim and loss of the related assets. The total pretax gain
    recognized in 2004 from this insurance claim was
    $5.3 million and is included in operating income in the
    consolidated statement of income. As a result of the flood, the
    Company has ceased operations at this location. Plant closure
    costs of $3.6 million associated with this decision were
    recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004, and were reflected in
    the determination of the gain.

    $230.5 million in 2008; $5.5 million in 2009;
    $104.4 million in 2010; $0.3 million in 2011; and
    $129.1 million in 2012 and thereafter.

At December 2005, the Company had outstanding a
    21.5 million British pound ($37.0 million) 5.31%
    (London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .69%) floating term
    loan with annual installment payments due through 2010. In
    connection with the SPECTRO acquisition, the Company issued a
    50 million euro ($59.2 million at December 31,
    2005) 3.94% senior note due in 2015. In November 2004,
    the Company issued a 40 million British pound
    ($68.8 million at December 31,
    2005) 5.99% senior note due in 2016. In September
    2003, the Company issued a 50 million British pound
    ($86.0 million at December 31,
    2005) 5.96% senior note due in 2010.

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization facility
    agreement through a wholly owned, special purpose subsidiary,
    and the special purpose subsidiary has a receivables sale
    agreement with a bank whereby it could sell to a third party up
    to $75.0 million of its trade accounts receivable on a
    revolving basis. The securitization facility is a financing
    vehicle utilized by the Company because it offers attractive
    rates relative to other financing sources. All securitized
    accounts receivable and related debt are reflected on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The special purpose subsidiary is the servicer of the accounts
    receivable under the securitization facility. The securitization
    facility expires in December 2006. The Company intends to renew
    the securitization facility on an annual basis. Interest rates
    on amounts drawn down are based on prevailing market rates for
    short-term commercial paper plus a program fee. The Company also
    pays a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the
    securitization facility. The Company’s accounts receivable
    securitization is accounted for as a secured borrowing under
    SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, securitized accounts
    receivable and the corresponding debt on the consolidated
    balance sheet were $75.0 million and $38.0 million,
    respectively. Interest expense under this facility is not
    significant. The weighted average interest rate on the amount
    outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization during
    2005 and 2004 was 4.3% and 2.0%, respectively.

The Company has an unsecured $300 million Revolving Credit
    Facility that matures in June 2010. The credit facility has an
    accordion feature that allows the Company to request up to an
    additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at
    any time during the term of the revolving credit agreement.
    Interest rates on outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit
    Facility are either at LIBOR plus a negotiated spread over
    LIBOR, or at the U.S. prime rate. At December 31,
    2005, the Company had an outstanding revolving credit loan of
    $71.2 million. At December 31, 2004, the Company had
    no revolving credit loan outstanding. The Company had
    outstanding letters of credit totaling $26.9 million and
    $28.5 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. At December 31, 2005, $201.9 million was
    unused and available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility places certain restrictions on
    allowable subsidiary debt. The Revolving Credit Facility also
    places certain restrictions on certain cash payments, including
    the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2005, retained
    earnings of approximately $36.5 million were not subject to
    the dividend limitation.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
    facilities with local foreign lenders of approximately
    $87.0 million at December 31, 2005. Foreign
    subsidiaries had debt outstanding at December 31, 2005
    totaling $46.2 million, of which $36.3 million is
    reported as long-term.

The approximate weighted average interest rate on total debt
    outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 6.4% and
    6.2%, respectively.

Stockholders’
    Equity

In 2005 and 2004, the Company did not repurchase any shares of
    its common stock under its current share repurchase
    authorization. At December 31, 2005, approximately
    $52.4 million of the current share purchase authorization
    was unexpended. At December 31, 2005, the Company held
    approximately 1.2 million shares in its treasury at a cost
    of $17.2 million, compared with approximately
    1.7 million shares at a cost of $24.5 million at the
    end of 2004. The number of shares outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 was 70.5 million shares, compared
    with 68.7 million shares at December 31, 2004.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
    Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of
    one-half of a Right for each share of Company common stock owned
    at the inception of the Plan. The Plan provides, under certain
    conditions involving acquisition of the Company’s common
    stock, that holders of Rights, except for the acquiring entity,
    would be entitled (i) to purchase shares of preferred stock
    at a specified exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares
    of common stock of the Company, or the acquiring company, having
    a value of twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the
    Plan expire in 2007.

10.

Stock
    Option and Award Plans

The Company’s 2002 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant
    of up to 4.0 million shares of common stock to eligible
    employees and non-employee directors of the Company in the form
    of options, phantom stock awards, restricted stock awards and
    stock rights. The Company’s 1999 Stock Incentive Plan
    permits the grant of up to 4.0 million shares of common
    stock in the same forms as under the 2002 Plan. The
    Company’s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of up
    to 7.6 million shares of common stock in the same forms as
    under the 2002 Plan. Stock options may be granted as
    non-qualified stock options or as incentive stock options.

In 2004, the Company adopted a change in its long-term incentive
    compensation program for officers and other senior managers to
    grant approximately 50% of the value of its long-term incentive
    awards as restricted stock and 50% as stock options, rather than
    primarily stock options as it had previously. Restricted awards
    of the Company’s common stock are made to eligible
    employees and non-employee directors at such cost to the grantee
    as the compensation committee of the Board of Directors may
    determine at the date such awards are granted. Such shares are
    granted subject to certain conditions with respect to transfer
    and other restrictions as prescribed by the plan. Upon grant of
    restricted stock, unearned compensation, equivalent to the
    excess of the market price of the shares awarded over the
    exercise price at the date of grant, is charged as a reduction
    of capital in excess of par value in the

Company’s consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to
    expense over the period until the restrictions lapse, which is
    also set at the date of the grant. In 2005 and 2004, 529,440 and
    367,625 shares of restricted stock were granted at an
    average market value of $37.78 and $27.96 per restricted
    share, respectively. No restricted stock awards were granted in
    2003. Compensation expense related to restricted stock
    amortization was $4.7 million, $1.1 million, and
    $2.4 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
    Restricted stock compensation expense in 2003 included
    $2.1 million in connection with the acceleration of vesting
    of a restricted stock grant. There were 883,025 shares and
    364,945 shares of restricted stock outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”), in 2005, the Company reserved
    13,443 shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements
    and terminations were minimal in 2005. The total number of
    shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was 187,303 as of
    December 31, 2005. Charges to expense under the SERP, not
    significant in amount, are considered pension expense, with the
    offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par value.

At December 31, 2005, 5,126,344 (6,919,840 in
    2004) shares of common stock were reserved for issuance,
    including stock options outstanding, under the 2002, 1999 and
    1997 plans. The options are exercisable at prices not less than
    market prices on dates of grant, and in installments over
    four-to ten-year periods from dates of grant. Options vest on a
    straight-line basis generally over a four-year period. The
    Company had no stock appreciation rights outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 or 2004. Stock appreciation rights, if
    and when issued, are exercisable for cash

and/or

shares of the Company’s common stock when the related
    option is exercised. A charge to income would be made for these
    rights and the related options under current accounting rules.

Leases
    and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases
    in effect at December 31, 2005 (principally for production
    and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to
    $49.1 million, consisting of annual payments of
    $9.3 million in 2006, $6.5 million in 2007,
    $5.2 million in 2008, $3.7 million in 2009,
    $2.8 million in 2010, and $21.6 million in 2011 and
    thereafter. Rental expense was $14.5 million in 2005,
    $11.3 million in 2004 and $9.0 million in 2003. The
    leases expire over a range of years from 2006 to 2031, with
    renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and
    conditions, contained in most of the leases.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had
    $129.4 million and $75.5 million, respectively, in
    purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of
    contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed
    prices.

In 2005, U.S. deferred income taxes totaling
    $2.0 million were provided on undistributed earnings of
    certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries

that are not expected to be permanently reinvested in such
    companies. There has been no provision for U.S. deferred
    income taxes for the undistributed earnings of certain other
    subsidiaries, which total approximately $61.9 million at
    December 31, 2005, because the Company intends to reinvest
    these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United
    States. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United
    States, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes
    and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.



AMETEK,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income
    tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss
    carryforwards of approximately $21.6 million for tax
    purposes, which will be available to offset future income taxes
    payable subject to certain annual or other limitations based on
    U.S. and foreign tax law. This amount includes net operating
    loss carryforwards of $14.2 million for federal income tax
    purposes with a valuation allowance of $5.8 million,
    $4.9 million for foreign income tax purposes with a
    valuation allowance of $0.3 million, and $2.5 million
    for state income tax purposes with a full valuation allowance.
    These net operating loss carryforwards are primarily related to
    recent acquisitions, and if not used, will expire between 2007
    and 2030. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has foreign
    tax credits of approximately $6.3 million which will be
    available to offset future income taxes payable subject to
    certain limitations based on U.S. tax law. There is a full
    valuation allowance on the foreign tax credits. If not used, the
    credits will expire in 2014 and 2015. The Company maintains a
    valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to
    amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Any
    reductions in the allowance resulting from the realization of
    the loss carryforwards of acquired companies will result in a
    reduction of goodwill.

Retirement
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement
    and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
    covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
    generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of
    service

and/or

compensation. The following is a brief description of the
    Company’s retirement and pension plans.

The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
    benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
    trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
    Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined
    benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
    based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
    of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. AMETEK estimates
    that it will make cash contributions of approximately
    $12 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans
    in 2006.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its
    U.S. defined benefit pension plans and an October 1
    measurement date for its foreign defined benefit pension plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for
    eligible employees. Participants in the savings plan may
    contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
    basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis up to 6% of eligible compensation or a maximum of
    $1,200 per participant.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined
    contribution retirement feature principally to cover
    U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after
    December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
    Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
    pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary
    subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the
    Company’s foreign operations participate in various local
    defined contribution plans.

The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
    certain of its U.S. acquired businesses for the benefit of
    eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
    participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed 6% of
    the participant’s base compensation.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
    Directors and certain retired executives. It also provides
    supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
    arrangements

and/or

a
    Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) covering certain
    current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental
    benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement
    benefits that would have been provided under the Company’s
    primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on
    compensation that must be taken into



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

account under those plans. The projected benefit obligations of
    the SERP and the contracts will primarily be funded by a grant
    of shares of the Company’s common stock upon retirement or
    termination of the executive. The Company is providing for these
    obligations by charges to earnings over the applicable periods.

Amounts in 2005 and 2004 include an approximate 10% investment
    in alternative assets consisting of diversified hedge funds.
    Amounts in 2005 and 2004 also include cash and cash equivalents.

The fair value of plan assets for these plans was
    $356.9 million and $341.5 million at December 31,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. The expected long-term rate of
    return on these plan assets was 8.5% in 2005 and 8.9% in 2004.
    Equity securities included 452,800 shares of AMETEK, Inc.
    common stock in the amount of $19.4 million (5.4% of total
    plan investment assets) and 662,800 shares in the amount of
    $23.6 million (6.9% of total plan investment assets) at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the plans’
    funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
    expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
    term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
    established. Since there may be periods of time where both
    equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an
    allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
    overall portfolio’s diversification and return potential.
    The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking
    into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
    streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
    actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
    established targets and ranges, and rebalanced when necessary.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
    style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
    component.

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets
    is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
    assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
    portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
    guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
    interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in
    note (a) above, certain investments are prohibited.
    Prohibited investments include venture capital, private
    placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading,

commodities, limited partnerships, short selling, and rights and

    contracts may be used to manage foreign currency exposure.

For the Company’s foreign defined benefit plans, the asset

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
    rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
    level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
    of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
    different asset classes, relative to the plans’ liabilities
    and how this can be affected by diversification, and the
    relative returns available on equities, fixed-income
    investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility
    of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are
    considered. It is expected that equities will outperform
    fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the
    trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may
    better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
    relatively young active employee group covered by the plans, and
    the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to
    adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward
    equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be
    reviewed from time to time in view of changes in market
    conditions and in the plans’ liability profile.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
    developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
    the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
    assets. This review also considered current capital market
    conditions and expectations of projected future investment
    returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
    category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
    The current low interest rate environment also influences this
    outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans
    was reduced from 8.50% to 8.25% for 2006. The expected return on
    assets for the foreign plans for 2006 will be reduced from 7.20%
    to 7.00%.

Estimated
    future benefit payments

The estimated future benefit payments are as follows (in

    2010 - $26,113; 2011 to 2015 - $144,162.
    Future benefit payments primarily represent amounts to be paid
    from pension trust assets. Amounts included that are to be paid
    from the Company’s assets are not significant in any
    individual year.

Postretirement
    Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
    pensions for certain retirees and a small number of current and
    former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not
    funded and are not significant. In connection with the flood
    loss and closure of the plant described in Note 7, in the
    fourth quarter of 2004, the Company accelerated the recognition
    of deferred actuarial losses under the affected postretirement
    benefit plan, resulting in a $1.0 million pretax charge
    against earnings.

The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
    certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
    retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
    employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
    retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
    compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
    invested in either, or a combination of, (a) an
    interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
    the general assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of
    a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common
    stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
    plan, including income earned, was $7.3 million and
    $5.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by
    the Company and is not significant.

Business
    Segment and Geographic Information

Descriptive
    Information about Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, the Electronic
    Instruments Group and the Electromechanical Group. The Company
    manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments for
    segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
    type, production processes, distribution methods, and management
    organizations.

The Electronic Instruments Group produces instrumentation for
    various electronic applications used in transportation
    industries, including aircraft cockpit instruments and displays,
    airborne electronics systems that monitor and record flight and
    engine data, and pressure, temperature, flow and liquid-level
    sensors for commercial airlines and aircraft and jet engine
    manufacturers. The Group also produces analytical
    instrumentation for the laboratory and research markets, as well
    as instruments for food service equipment, measurement and
    monitoring instrumentation for various process industries and
    instruments and complete instrument panels for heavy truck
    manufacturers and heavy construction and agricultural vehicles.
    The Group also manufactures ultraprecise measurement
    instrumentation, as well as thermoplastic compounds for
    automotive, appliance, and telecommunications applications.

The Electromechanical Group (“EMG”) produces brushless
    air-moving motors for aerospace, mass transit, medical
    equipment, computer and business machine applications. The Group
    also produces high-purity metal powders and alloys in powder,
    strip, and wire form for electronic components, aircraft and
    automotive products, as well as heat exchangers and thermal
    management subsystems. Additionally, EMG produces air-moving
    electric motors and motor-blower systems for manufacturers of
    floor care appliances and outdoor power equipment. EMG also
    supplies hermetically sealed (moisture-proof) connectors,
    terminals and headers. These electromechanical devices are used
    in aerospace, defense, and other industrial applications. Sales
    of floor care and specialty motors represented 19.2% in 2005,
    22.1% in 2004, and 25.4% in 2003 of the Company’s
    consolidated net sales.

Measurement
    of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
    and expenses (including certain administrative and other
    expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include an
    allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
    reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and
    profits, which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are
    generally based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment
    assets include allocations directly related to the
    segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of
    investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits, and deferred
    taxes.

Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
    basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
    of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
    business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
    parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
    enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. The
    amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
    the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
    point in time. The maximum amount of future payment obligations
    relative to these various guarantees was approximately
    $98.2 million, and the outstanding liability under certain
    of those guarantees was approximately $40.8 million at
    December 31, 2005. These guarantees expire in 2006 through
    2010.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
    transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
    compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
    unfavorable financial consequences resulting from



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations, or
    retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee
    liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not
    explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such
    indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount
    of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically
    stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
    indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
    Company indemnifies its directors and officers who are or were
    serving at the Company’s request in such capacities.
    Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related
    to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The
    Company believes that future payments, if any, under all
    existing indemnification agreements should not have a material
    impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash
    flows.

Product
    Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
    sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
    vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the
    most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
    warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience,
    and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
    expenses.

Changes in the Company’s accrued product warranty
    obligation for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
    were as follows (in thousands):

Contingencies

Asbestos
    Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a
    defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of
    asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate
    to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not
    involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company,
    or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which
    are under new ownership. In connection with many of these
    lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the
    case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these
    claims (the “Indemnified Claims”). The Indemnified
    Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such
    sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met
    their obligations in all respects, and the Company does not have
    any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their
    obligations in the future. To date, no judgments have been
    rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related
    lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the
    claims being asserted, and intends to continue to vigorously
    defend itself in these matters.



AMETEK,

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
    existing at that time, the Company has been named a Potentially
    Responsible Party (PRP) at 20

non-AMETEK

owned sites. The Company is identified as a
    “de-minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the
    low volume of relative waste attributed to the Company. In 10 of
    these sites, the Company has reached agreement on the cost of
    the de-minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is
    awaiting executed agreements. The agreed to settlement amounts
    are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is
    continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
    attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
    responsible for remedial activity at the site to establish an
    appropriate settlement amount. In the six remaining sites where
    the Company is a non-de-minimis PRP, the Company is
    participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
    issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
    this result will continue. In addition to these

non-AMETEK

owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing
    reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its
    current or previously owned manufacturing locations and for
    claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other
    environmental matters once the Company has determined that a
    loss is probable and estimable. Total environmental reserves at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $6.8 million and
    $7.3 million, respectively. The Company spent
    $1.0 million on such environmental matters in 2005 and
    2004. The Company also has agreements with former owners of
    certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
    previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements,
    the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to
    indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other
    liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
    the other parties carry insurance coverage for some
    environmental matters. To date, those parties have met their
    obligations in all material respects. The Company has no reason
    to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their
    obligations in the future. However, if the Company were required
    to record a liability with respect to all, or a portion of, such
    matters on its balance sheet, the effect on income and the
    amount of the liability could be significant. In the opinion of
    management, based upon presently available information and past
    experience related to such matters, either adequate provision
    for probable costs has been made, or the ultimate cost resulting
    from these actions is not expected to materially affect the
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows of the Company.

    Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and

    Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the system of
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005.
    Based on that evaluation, the Company’s principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
    in all material respects as of December 31, 2005.

Such evaluation did not identify any change in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the year ended December 31, 2005 that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
