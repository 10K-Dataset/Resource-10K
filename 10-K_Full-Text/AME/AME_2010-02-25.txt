    to the Investor Relations Department at AMETEK, Inc., 37 North
    Valley Road, Building 4, Paoli, Pennsylvania 19301.

Products
    and Services

The Company markets its products worldwide through two operating
    groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and
    the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). EIG builds
    monitoring, testing, calibration and display devices for the
    process, aerospace, industrial and power markets. EMG is a
    supplier of electromechanical devices. EMG produces highly
    engineered electromechanical connectors for hermetic
    (moisture-proof) applications, specialty metals for niche
    markets and brushless air-moving motors, blowers and heat
    exchangers. End markets include aerospace, defense, mass
    transit, medical, office products and other industrial markets.
    The Company believes that EMG is the world’s largest
    manufacturer of air-moving electric motors for vacuum cleaners
    and is a prominent producer of motors for other floor care
    products. The Company continues to grow through strategic
    acquisitions focused on differentiated niche markets in
    instrumentation and electromechanical devices.

Competitive
    Strengths

Management believes that the Company has several significant
    competitive advantages that assist it in sustaining and
    enhancing its market positions. Its principal strengths include:

Significant Market Share.

AMETEK maintains a
    significant share in many of its targeted niche markets because
    of its ability to produce and deliver high-quality products at
    competitive prices. In EIG, the Company maintains significant
    market positions in many niche segments within the process,
    aerospace, industrial and power instrumentation markets. In EMG,
    the Company maintains significant market positions in many niche
    segments including aerospace, defense, mass transit, medical,
    office products and air-moving motors for the floor care market.

Technological and Development
    Capabilities.

AMETEK believes it has certain
    technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to
    develop innovative products and maintain leading market
    positions. Historically, the Company has grown by extending its
    technical expertise into the manufacture of customized products
    for its customers, as well as through strategic acquisitions.
    EIG competes primarily on the basis of product innovation in
    several highly specialized instrumentation markets, including
    process measurement, aerospace, power and heavy-vehicle
    dashboard instrumentation. EMG’s differentiated businesses
    focus on



developing customized products for specialized applications in
    aerospace and defense, medical, business machines and other
    industrial applications. In its cost-driven motor business, EMG
    focuses on low-cost design and manufacturing, while enhancing
    motor-blower performance through advances in power, efficiency,
    lighter weight and quieter operation.

Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing
    Operations.

EMG has motor manufacturing plants in
    China, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Brazil to lower its costs
    and achieve strategic proximity to its customers, providing the
    opportunity to increase international sales and market share.
    Certain of the Company’s electronic instrument businesses
    have relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
    Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and joint ventures in
    Europe, North America and Asia have resulted in additional cost
    savings and synergies through the consolidation of operations,
    product lines and distribution channels, which benefits both
    operating groups.

Experienced Management Team.

Another key
    component of AMETEK’s success is the strength of its
    management team and its commitment to the performance of the
    Company. AMETEK’s senior management has extensive
    experience, averaging approximately 24 years with the
    Company, and is financially committed to the Company’s
    success through Company-established stock ownership guidelines
    and equity incentive programs.

Business
    Strategy

AMETEK’s objectives are to increase the Company’s
    earnings and financial returns through a combination of
    operational and financial strategies. Those operational
    strategies include business acquisitions, new product
    development, global and market expansion and Operational
    Excellence programs designed to achieve double-digit annual
    percentage growth in earnings per share over the business cycle
    and a superior return on total capital. To support those
    operational objectives, financial initiatives have been, or may
    be, undertaken, including public and private debt or equity
    issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain
    foreign countries, accounts receivable securitization and share
    repurchases. AMETEK’s commitment to earnings growth is
    reflected in its continued implementation of cost-reduction
    programs designed to achieve the Company’s long-term
    best-cost objectives.

AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key
    strategies:

Operational Excellence.

Operational Excellence
    is AMETEK’s cornerstone strategy for improving profit
    margins and strengthening the Company’s competitive
    position across its businesses. Through its Operational
    Excellence strategy, the Company seeks to reduce production
    costs and improve its market positions. The strategy has played
    a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies.
    AMETEK believes that Operational Excellence, which focuses on
    Six Sigma process improvements, global sourcing and lean
    manufacturing and also emphasizes team building and a
    participative management culture, has enabled the Company to
    improve operating efficiencies and product quality, increase
    customer satisfaction and yield higher cash flow from
    operations, while lowering operating and administrative costs
    and shortening manufacturing cycle times.

    earnings through sales growth and operational efficiencies at
    the acquired businesses. Since the beginning of 2005, through
    December 31, 2009, the Company has completed 24
    acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately
    $1.0 billion, including three acquisitions in 2009 (see
    “Recent Acquisitions”). Through these and prior
    acquisitions, the Company’s management team has gained
    considerable experience in successfully acquiring and
    integrating new businesses. The Company intends to continue to
    pursue this acquisition strategy.

    OVERVIEW

Operating
    Performance

In 2009, AMETEK generated sales of $2.1 billion, a decrease
    of 17% from 2008. The Company’s results include the
    contributions of recently acquired businesses and the
    Company’s continuing cost reduction initiatives.

Financing

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company paid in full a
    40 million British pound ($62.0 million) borrowing
    under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2009,
    the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving
    credit facility. The $100 million accounts receivable
    securitization facility was not renewed by the Company in May
    2009.

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding



occurred in September 2008 for $250 million, consisting of
    $90 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.59% senior notes due September 2015 and $160 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.08% senior notes due
    September 2018. The second funding date occurred in December
    2008 for $100 million, consisting of $35 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.69% senior notes due

    of 7.18% senior notes due December 2018. The senior notes
    carry a weighted average interest rate of 6.93%. The proceeds
    from the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the
    borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit
    facility.

In July 2008, the Company paid in full the $225 million
    7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from
    borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility. Also in
    July 2008, the Company obtained the second funding of
    $80 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.35% senior notes due July 2018 under the 2007 private
    placement agreement, which completed the sale of
    $450 million in senior notes to a group of institutional
    investors. The first funding of the 2007 private placement
    occurred in December 2007 for $370 million, consisting of
    $270 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due
    December 2019.

Financial
    Information About Reportable Segments, Foreign Operations and
    Export Sales

Information with respect to reportable segments and geographic
    areas is set forth in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The Company’s international sales decreased 16% to
    $1,031.7 million in 2009. The decrease was driven by the
    decline in international sales from base businesses, partially
    offset by the impact of acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2008.
    The Company experienced decreases in export sales of products
    manufactured in the United States, as well as decreased sales
    from overseas operations. International sales represented 49% of

    in aerospace and defense, business machines, computer equipment,
    mass transit vehicles, medical equipment, power, and industrial
    applications.



EMG produces electronically commutated (brushless) motors,
    blowers and pumps that offer long life, reliability and near
    maintenance-free operation. These motor-blower systems and heat
    exchangers are used for thermal management and other
    applications on a wide variety of military and commercial
    aircraft and military ground vehicles, and are used increasingly
    in medical and other applications, in which their long life, and
    spark-free and reliable operation is very important. These
    motors provide cooling and ventilation for business machines,
    computers and mass transit vehicles.

EMG also serves the commercial and military aerospace third
    party maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) market.
    These businesses provide these services on a global basis with
    facilities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore.

    heat-transfer repair services to the commercial aerospace
    industry and represents a further expansion of AMETEK’s
    growing presence in the global aerospace MRO industry.

Engineered
    Materials, Interconnects and Packaging Markets and
    Products

27% of EMG’s 2009 sales are engineered materials,
    interconnects and packaging products. AMETEK is an innovator and
    market leader in specialized metal powder, strip, wire and
    bonded products. It produces stainless steel and nickel clad
    alloys; stainless steel, cobalt and nickel alloy powders; metal
    strip; specialty shaped and electronic wire; and advanced metal
    matrix composites used in electronic thermal management. Its
    products are used in automotive, appliance, medical and
    surgical, aerospace, telecommunications, marine and general
    industrial applications. Its niche market focus is based upon
    proprietary manufacturing technology and strong customer
    relationships.

Reading Alloys, acquired in April 2008, is a niche specialty
    metals producer. It produces titanium master alloys and expands
    our position in customized titanium products. Reading Alloys
    adds to our capabilities in strip and foil products used in
    medical devices, electronic components and aerospace
    instruments. Its metal powder production techniques complement
    our existing gas and water atomization capabilities.

Floor
    Care and Specialty Motor Markets and Products

24% of EMG’s 2009 sales are to floor care and
    specialty motor markets, where it has the leading share, through
    its sales of air-moving electric motors to most of the
    world’s major floor care OEMs, including vertically
    integrated OEMs that produce some of their own motors. EMG
    produces motor-blowers for a full range of floor care products,
    ranging from hand-held, canister and upright vacuums to central
    vacuums for residential use. High-performance vacuum motors also
    are marketed for commercial and industrial applications.

The Company also manufactures a variety of specialty motors used
    in a wide range of products, such as household and personal care
    appliances; fitness equipment; electric materials handling
    vehicles; and sewing machines. Additionally, its products are
    used in outdoor power equipment, such as electric chain saws,
    leaf blowers, string trimmers and power washers.

EMG has been successful in directing a portion of its global
    floor care marketing at vertically integrated vacuum cleaner
    manufacturers, who seek to outsource all or part of their motor
    production. By purchasing their motors from EMG, these customers
    are able to realize economic and operational advantages by
    reducing or



discontinuing their own motor production and avoiding the
    capital investment required to keep their motor manufacturing
    current with changing technologies and market demands.

Customers

EMG is not dependent on any single customer such that the loss
    of that customer would have a material adverse effect on
    EMG’s operations. Approximately 10% of EMG’s 2009
    sales were made to its five largest customers and no one
    customer accounted for 10% or more of 2009 consolidated net
    sales.

Marketing

The Company’s marketing efforts generally are organized and
    carried out at the division level. EIG makes significant use of
    distributors and sales representatives in marketing its
    products, as well as direct sales in some of its more
    technically sophisticated products. Within aerospace, its
    specialized customer base of aircraft and jet engine
    manufacturers is served primarily by direct sales engineers.
    Given the technical nature of many of its products, as well as
    its significant worldwide market share, EMG conducts much of its
    domestic and international marketing activities through a direct
    sales force and makes some use of sales representatives and
    distributors both in the United States and in other countries.

Competition

In general, most of the Company’s markets are highly
    competitive. The principal elements of competition for the
    Company’s products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality and service.

In the markets served by EIG, the Company believes that it ranks
    among the leading U.S. producers of certain measuring and
    control instruments. It also is a leader in the
    U.S. heavy-vehicle instrumentation and power instrument
    markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers
    to the commercial aviation market. Competition remains strong
    and can intensify for certain EIG products, especially its
    pressure gauge and heavy-vehicle instrumentation products. Both
    of these businesses have several strong competitors. In the
    process and analytical instruments market, numerous companies in
    each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality,
    performance and innovation. The aerospace and power instrument
    businesses have a number of diversified competitors, which vary
    depending on the specific market niche.

EMG’s differentiated businesses have competition from a
    limited number of companies in each of their markets.
    Competition is generally based on product innovation,
    performance and price. There also is competition from
    alternative materials and processes. In its cost-driven
    businesses, EMG has limited domestic competition in the
    U.S. floor care market from independent manufacturers.
    Competition is increasing from Asian motor manufacturers that
    serve both the U.S. and the European floor care markets.
    Increasingly, global vacuum motor production is being shifted to
    Asia where AMETEK has a smaller but growing market position.
    There is potential competition from vertically integrated
    manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own
    motor-blowers. Many of these manufacturers would also be
    potential EMG customers if they decided to outsource their motor
    production.

Backlog
    and Seasonal Variations of Business

The Company’s backlog of unfilled orders by business
    segment was as follows at December 31:

The lower backlog at December 31, 2009 was primarily due to
    the global economic recession, partially offset by the
    acquisition of High Standard Aviation and Ameron Global in 2009
    and the positive impact of a weakening U.S. dollar when
    compared to the British pound and Euro.



Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31,
    2009, approximately 82% is expected to be shipped by
    December 31, 2010. The Company believes that neither its
    business as a whole, nor either of its reportable segments, is
    subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain
    individual operations experience some seasonal variability.

Availability
    of Raw Materials

The Company’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and
    supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than
    one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various
    base metals and certain steel components, are available only
    from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes its
    sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs.

Research,
    Product Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development and engineering costs
    before customer reimbursement were $101.4 million,
    $115.9 million and $102.9 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2009, 2008 and
    2007 were $5.5 million, $6.1 million and
    $7.1 million, respectively. These amounts included net
    Company-funded research and development expenses of
    $50.5 million, $57.5 million and $52.9 million,
    respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the
    development of new products and processes and the improvement of
    existing products and processes.

Environmental
    Matters

Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth
    in the section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations entitled
    “Environmental Matters” and in Note 19 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Patents,
    Licenses and Trademarks

The Company owns numerous unexpired U.S. patents and
    foreign patents, including counterparts of its more important
    U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the
    world. The Company is a licensor or licensee under patent
    agreements of various types and its products are marketed under
    various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign
    trademarks and trade names. However, the Company does not
    consider any single patent or trademark, or any group thereof,
    essential either to its business as a whole or to either of its
    business segments. The annual royalties received or paid under
    license agreements are not significant to either of its
    reportable segments or to the Company’s overall operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2009, the Company employed approximately
    10,100 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of
    whom approximately 2,600 employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. The Company has five
    collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2010, which
    covers less than 200 employees. The Company expects no
    material adverse effects from the pending labor contract
    negotiations.

Working
    Capital Practices

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital
    requirements in either of its reportable segments. Customers
    generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include
    extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled
    and maintained at levels related to production cycles and are
    responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.



Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all
    other information contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect
    our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Current
    economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could
    adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

The global economy has recently undergone a period of
    unprecedented volatility and distress in financial markets, as
    well as a general slowdown in demand, including in many of the
    end markets we serve. A prolonged period of economic decline or
    stagnation could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations and financial condition and exacerbate the other
    risk factors we have described below. These economic
    developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways.
    Our global business is adversely affected by decreases in the
    general level of economic activity, such as decreases in
    business and consumer spending, capital spending, air travel,
    industrial production and government procurement. Any economic
    slowdown results in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for
    our products and services and negatively impacts the ability of
    our customers to make timely payments. In addition, the
    potential for one or more of our customers or suppliers to
    experience financial distress or bankruptcy is increased.
    Furthermore, a disparate impact on, or government actions
    affecting, one of the major economies could produce volatility
    in the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against certain
    major currencies, adversely affecting our results. We are unable
    to predict the timing, duration and severity of any further
    disruptions in financial markets or adverse economic conditions
    in the U.S. and other countries.

A
    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely
    affect our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in
    nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control.
    A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our
    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be
    able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate
    recent and future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of
    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2005, through
    December 31, 2009, we have completed 24 acquisitions. We
    plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our
    global market position and broaden our product offerings.
    Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies
    in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions
    will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:

•

Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;

•

The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may
    increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate
    acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a
    greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;

•

Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including
    integrating the financial, technological and management
    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses
    with those of our existing operations;

•

Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms
    acceptable to us;

•

U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting
    our ability to make certain acquisitions;

•

Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of
    acquired businesses;

•

Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

•

Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity
    and complexity of our operations.



The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing
    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and
    may require additional financial resources and attention from
    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing
    development or expansion of our existing operations.
    Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired
    business may not achieve the results we expected or produce
    expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue
    with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of
    acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

We may
    experience unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    product line transfers.

Certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently
    relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
    Unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    completing product line transfers, as well as possible
    underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in
    production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our
    business and operations.

Our
    substantial international sales and operations are subject to
    customary risks associated with international
    operations.

International sales for 2009 and 2008 represented 49% and 48% of
    our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our
    growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales
    outside the United States will increase in the future.
    International operations are subject to the customary risks of
    operating in an international environment, including:

•

Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;

•

Overlap of different tax structures;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including
    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries
    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;

•

Restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

General economic conditions;

•

Unstable political situations;

•

Nationalization of assets; and

•

Compliance with a wide variety of international and
    U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.

Our
    international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by
    compliance with export laws.

We are required to comply with various import, export, export
    control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our
    transactions with certain customers, business partners and other
    persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our
    employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export
    control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the
    export of certain products, services and technologies and in
    other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export
    license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure
    to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil
    and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions
    to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export
    products and services and damage to our reputation.



Any
    inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to
    compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate
    acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results
    from those businesses, manage our expanding international
    operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if
    we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the
    expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and
    employees may adversely affect our results of operations.

If we
    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could
    adversely affect our business and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our
    ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced
    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.
    Although we believe we have certain technological and other
    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages
    will require us to continue investing in research and
    development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance
    that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments,
    that we will be able to make the technological advances
    necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can
    recover major research and development expenses. We are not
    currently aware of any emerging standards or new products, which
    could render our existing products obsolete, although there can
    be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able
    to develop and successfully market new products.

A
    shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could
    increase our operating costs.

We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material
    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;
    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel
    components, are available only from a limited number of
    suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations.
    Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could
    affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our
    competitive position, which could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Certain
    environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs
    associated with hazardous or toxic substance

clean-up

which may adversely affect our financial
    condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a
    number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
    occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning,
    among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the
    use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage,
    transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
    Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing
    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous
    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of
    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at
    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew
    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous
    materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint
    and several liability for

clean-up

costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing
    hazardous substances to sites designated for

clean-up

under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible
    party at several sites, which are the subject of
    government-mandated

clean-ups.

As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that
    use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous
    materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation,
    removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to
    compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to
    precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending
    environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we
    believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have
    a material adverse effect on our financial position or future
    results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations,
    new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement
    of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis
    for new or increased liabilities that could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. There can be no assurance that future
    environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental
    damages due to prior or present practices will not result in
    future liabilities.



We are
    subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be
    burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and
    foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing
    laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new
    laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change,
    may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our
    products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or
    regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and
    regulations will have on our business or operations.

We may
    be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with
    alleged or actual harm caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product
    liability claims in the event that the use of our products is
    alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For
    example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for
    personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for
    instance, an aircraft component that has been designed,
    manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant
    liability if product liability lawsuits against us are
    successful. While we believe our current general liability and
    product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from
    future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate
    to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be
    able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an
    acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for
    which third-party indemnification is not available could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We
    operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely
    affect our results of operations or ability to expand our
    business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and
    internationally, with individual producers, as well as with
    vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have
    resources greater than we do. The principal elements of
    competition for our products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality and service. EMG’s competition in
    specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and
    processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG
    is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify.
    In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets
    served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the
    basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our
    competitors may develop new or improve existing products that
    are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new
    technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There
    can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely
    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
    operates or that our products will be able to compete
    successfully with those of our competitors.

Our
    access to sources of liquidity may be limited by market
    conditions and restrictions in our revolving credit facility and
    other agreements.

In 2009, the financial markets have experienced a significant
    liquidity shortfall as a result of diverse conditions that have
    caused the failure and near failure of a number of large
    financial services companies. If the availability of funds
    remains limited, we could incur increased costs associated with
    renewal of our credit facility

and/or

other
    debt instruments. In addition, it is possible that our ability
    to access the credit market may be limited by these or other
    factors, at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which
    could have an impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt

and/or

react
    to changing economic and business conditions. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, at this time, we believe that available
    short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to
    fund our working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments,
    interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan
    contributions, income tax obligations, dividends to our
    shareholders, any contemplated acquisitions and share
    repurchases for the foreseeable future.

We are
    subject to possible insolvency of financial
    counterparties.

We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts
    including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit
    facilities, financial derivatives and investment management
    agreements involving various counterparties. We



are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties
    may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its
    obligations under such contracts.

Our
    goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial
    amount of our total assets and write-off of such substantial
    goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible
    assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2009, goodwill
    and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
    totaled $1,799.2 million or 55% of our total assets. The
    goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess
    of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other
    identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum,
    we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the
    value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance
    at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly
    below current levels, we could reflect, under current applicable
    accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for
    goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination
    requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or
    other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Properties

The Company has 99 operating plant facilities in 22 states
    and 12 foreign countries. Of these facilities, 50 are owned by
    the Company and 49 are leased. The properties owned by the
    Company consist of approximately 640 acres, of which
    approximately 4.3 million square feet are under roof. Under
    lease is a total of approximately 1.5 million square feet.
    The leases expire over a range of years from 2010 to 2082, with
    renewal options for varying terms contained in many of the
    leases. Production facilities in China, Taiwan and Japan provide
    the Company with additional production capacity through the
    Company’s investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures.
    The Company’s executive offices in Paoli, Pennsylvania,
    occupy approximately 34,000 square feet under a lease that
    expires in September 2010.

The Company’s machinery and equipment, plants and offices
    are in satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the
    uses to which they are put. The operating facilities of the

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company

and/or

its
    subsidiaries have been named as defendants, along with many
    other companies, in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. To
    date, no judgments have been entered against the Company. The
    Company believes it has strong defenses to the claims and
    intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these
    matters. Other companies are also indemnifying the Company
    against certain of these claims. To date, these parties have met
    their obligations in all material respects; however, one of
    these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007.

In August 2009, the Company agreed to a Stipulation and
    Settlement Agreement with the San Diego Regional Water
    Quality Control Board regarding the 2008 Notice of
    Administrative Civil Liability related to a former subsidiary
    which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy
    liquidation in 2007, whereby the Company paid and deferred minor
    penalties, which were covered by previously established
    reserves. (Also see “Environmental Matters” in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations and Note 19 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company’s
    security holders, through the solicitation of proxies or
    otherwise, during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The principal market on which the Company’s common stock is
    traded is the New York Stock Exchange and it is traded under the
    symbol “AME.” On January 29, 2010, there were
    approximately 2,200 holders of record of the Company’s
    common stock.

Market price and dividend information with respect to the
    Company’s common stock is set forth below. Future dividend
    payments by the Company will be dependent on future earnings,
    financial requirements, contractual provisions of debt
    agreements and other relevant factors.

Under its share repurchase program, the Company repurchased
    approximately 1,263,000 shares of common stock for
    $57.4 million in 2008 to offset the dilutive effect of

    presented because the Company is aware that it is used by rating
    agencies, securities analysts, investors and other parties in
    evaluating the Company. It should not be considered, however, as
    an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the
    Company’s operating performance or as an alternative to
    cash flows as a measure of the Company’s overall liquidity
    as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Furthermore, EBITDA measures shown for the Company
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
    companies. The following table presents the reconciliation of

Business
    Overview

As a global business, AMETEK’s operations are affected by
    global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the
    Company’s strategic geographic and industry
    diversification, and its mix of products and services, have
    helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable
    developments in any one industry or the economy of any single
    country on its consolidated operating results. Beginning in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout most of 2009, the Company
    experienced lower order rates as a result of the global economic
    recession. However, order rates stabilized in the third quarter
    of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. In
    2009, the Company posted solid sales, operating income, net
    income and diluted earnings per share given the global economic
    recession. The impact of contributions from recent acquisitions
    combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives had
    a positive impact on 2009 results. The Company also benefited
    from its strategic initiatives under AMETEK’s four growth
    strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development,
    Global and Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and
    Alliances. Highlights of 2009 were:

•

During 2009, the Company completed the following acquisitions:

•

In January 2009, the Company acquired High Standard Aviation.
    High Standard Aviation is a provider of electrical and
    electromechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic repair services to
    the aerospace industry.

•

In September 2009, the Company completed a small acquisition of
    two businesses in India, Unispec Marketing Pvt. Ltd. and Thelsha
    Technical Services Pvt. Ltd. This acquisition provides the
    Company with an established sales, distribution and service
    network in India serving the quality control and analytical
    instrumentation market.

•

In December 2009, the Company acquired Ameron Global, a
    manufacturer of highly engineered pressurized gas components and
    systems for commercial and aerospace customers. Ameron Global is
    also a leader in maintenance, repair and overhaul of fire
    suppression and oxygen supply systems

•

The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales
    presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales,
    were $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of consolidated sales in
    2009, compared with $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of
    consolidated sales in 2008.

•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research,
    development and engineering, spending $101.4 million in
    2009 before customer reimbursement of $5.5 million. Sales
    from products introduced in the last three years were
    $394.0 million or 18.8% of sales.

•

In 2009, the Company paid in full a 40 million British
    pound ($62.0 million) borrowing under the revolving credit
    facility in the second quarter and a 10.5 million British
    pound ($16.9 million) floating-rate term note in the fourth
    quarter.

•

As a result of the 2009 and 2008 Operational Excellence
    initiatives, which included initiatives associated with the
    2008 year end restructuring, the Company achieved
    $135 million in cost savings in 2009. The 2008 year
    end restructuring included pre-tax charges totaling
    $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income
    by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges
    include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility
    closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs
    ($7.4 million).

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Results
    of Operations

In 2009, the Company posted solid sales, operating income, net
    income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow given the
    global economic recession. The Company’s results include
    contributions from acquisitions completed in 2009 and the
    acquisitions of Motion Control Group (“MCG”), Drake
    Air (“Drake”) and Newage Testing Instruments in
    February 2008, Reading Alloys in April 2008, Vision Research,
    Inc. in June 2008, the programmable power business of Xantrex
    Technology, Inc. (“Xantrex Programmable”) in August
    2008 and Muirhead Aerospace Limited (“Muirhead”) in
    November 2008. The Company believes the impact of the global
    economic recession stabilized in the third quarter of 2009, with
    increased operating results in the fourth quarter of 2009 in
    most of its markets when compared to the previous quarters of
    2009, and expects operating results in 2010 to show further
    moderate improvement. The full year impact of the 2009
    acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities should
    have a positive impact on our 2010 results.

Net sales for 2009 were $2,098.4 million, a decrease of
    $432.7 million or 17.1% when compared with net sales of
    $2,531.1 million in 2008. Net sales for Electronic
    Instruments Group (“EIG”) were $1,146.6 million
    in 2009, a decrease of 18.3% from sales of $1,402.7 million
    in 2008. Net sales for Electromechanical Group (“EMG”)
    were $951.8 million in 2009, a decrease of 15.7% from sales
    of $1,128.5 million in 2008. The decline in net sales was
    primarily attributable to lower order rates as a result of the
    global economic recession, partially offset by the impact of the
    acquisitions mentioned above. The Company’s internal sales
    declined approximately 21% in 2009, which excludes a 2%
    unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The
    acquisitions mentioned above offset approximately 6% of the
    Company’s internal sales decline.

Total international sales for 2009 were $1,031.7 million or
    49.2% of consolidated net sales, a decrease of
    $193.8 million or 15.8% when compared with international
    sales of $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of consolidated net
    sales in 2008. The decline in international sales resulted from
    decreased international sales from base businesses of



$272.5 million, which includes the effect of foreign
    currency translation, partially offset by the impact of the
    acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2008. The Company maintains a
    strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia by both
    reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States,
    which are included in total international sales, were
    $400.6 million in 2009, a decrease of $77.9 million or
    16.3% compared with $478.5 million in 2008. Export
    shipments declined primarily due to decreased exports from the
    base businesses, partially offset by the acquisitions noted
    above.

New orders for 2009 were $2,028.1 million, a decrease of
    $533.4 million or 20.8% when compared with
    $2,561.5 million in 2008. Throughout most of 2009, the
    Company experienced lower order rates as a result of the global
    economic recession. However, order rates stabilized in the third
    quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of
    2009. As a result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders
    at December 31, 2009 was $648.4 million, a decrease of
    $70.2 million or 9.8% when compared with
    $718.6 million at December 31, 2008.

Segment operating income for 2009 was $399.5 million, a
    decrease of $82.4 million or 17.1% when compared with
    segment operating income of $481.9 million in 2008. Segment
    operating income, as a percentage of sales, was 19.0% in both
    2009 and 2008. The decrease in segment operating income resulted
    primarily from the decrease in sales noted above and higher
    defined benefit pension expense, partially offset by profit
    contributions made by the acquisitions and cost reduction
    initiatives, including $135 million of cost savings
    achieved in 2009 primarily from the restructuring activities
    related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges. As
    a result of defined benefit pension plan contributions in 2009
    and 2008, as well as overall stock market performance in 2009,
    the Company expects defined benefit pension expense to be lower
    in 2010.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses for 2009 were $254.1 million, a decrease of
    $68.5 million or 21.2% when compared with
    $322.6 million in 2008. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
    expenses were 12.1% for 2009, compared with 12.7% in 2008. The
    decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of lower
    sales and the Company’s cost savings initiatives.
    Additionally, 2008 SG&A expenses includes both a
    $7.1 million charge, recorded in corporate administrative
    expenses, related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2005
    restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2008 and
    $7.1 million of SG&A expense related to fourth quarter
    of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. Base
    business selling expenses decreased approximately 22%, which was
    in line with the Company’s 2009 sales decline. Selling
    expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 10.5% for 2009,
    compared with 10.8% in 2008 due to the previously mentioned cost
    savings initiatives.

Corporate administrative expenses for 2009 were
    $33.2 million, a decrease of $16.0 million or 32.5%
    when compared with $49.2 million in 2008. As a percentage
    of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.6% for 2009,
    compared with 1.9% in 2008. The decrease in corporate
    administrative expenses was driven by the equity-based
    compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of
    restricted stock in the second quarter of 2008, lower short-term
    incentive compensation in 2009 and the Company’s cost
    saving initiatives, including the restructuring activities,
    noted above.

Consolidated operating income was $366.1 million or 17.4%
    of sales for 2009, a decrease of $66.6 million or 15.4%
    when compared with $432.7 million or 17.1% of sales in 2008.

Interest expense was $68.8 million for 2009, an increase of
    $5.1 million or 8.0% when compared with $63.7 million
    in 2008. The increase was due to the full-year impact of the
    funding of the long-term private placement senior notes in the
    third and fourth quarters of 2008, partially offset by the
    repayment of 40 million British-pound-denominated debt
    under the revolver in the second quarter of 2009.

The effective tax rate for 2009 was 30.2% compared with 32.6% in
    2008. The lower effective tax rate for 2009 primarily reflects
    the impact of settlements of income tax examinations and
    benefits obtained from state and international income tax
    planning initiatives. The higher effective tax rate for 2008
    primarily reflects an increase in state and foreign income taxes
    and the impact of accelerated vesting of non-deductible
    restricted stock amortization, offset by the impact of
    settlements of various income tax issues with U.S. taxing
    authorities and a favorable agreement in the United Kingdom
    related to deductible interest expense for which previously
    unrecognized tax benefits were recognized. See Note 13 of
    the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this

for further details.



Net income for 2009 was $205.8 million, a decrease of
    $41.2 million or 16.7% when compared with
    $247.0 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2009
    was $1.91, a decrease of $0.39 or 17.0% when compared with $2.30
    per diluted share in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2008
    includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted
    earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.

Segment
    Results

EIG’s

sales totaled $1,146.6 million for 2009,
    a decrease of $256.1 million or 18.3% when compared with
    $1,402.7 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an
    internal sales decline of approximately 20%, excluding an
    unfavorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation, driven
    primarily by EIG’s process and industrial products
    businesses. Partially offsetting the sales decrease was the 2008
    acquisitions of Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex Programmable.

EIG’s operating income was $232.9 million for 2009, a
    decrease of $73.9 million or 24.1% when compared with
    $306.8 million in 2008. EIG’s operating margins were
    20.3% of sales for 2009 compared with 21.9% of sales in 2008.
    The decrease in segment operating income and operating margins
    was driven by the decrease in sales noted above, predominantly
    by weakness in the aerospace aftermarket, process and industrial
    businesses and higher defined benefit pension expense, which was
    partially offset by the cost savings achieved from the
    restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008
    restructuring charges. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million had a
    negative impact on EIG’s operating margins of
    140 basis points.

EMG’s

sales totaled $951.8 million for 2009, a
    decrease of $176.7 million or 15.7% from
    $1,128.5 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an
    internal sales decline of approximately 21%, excluding an
    unfavorable 3% effect of foreign currency translation, driven
    primarily by the engineered materials, interconnects and
    packaging products (“EMIP”) and cost driven motors
    businesses. Partially offsetting the sales decrease was the 2009
    acquisition of High Standard Aviation and the 2008 acquisitions
    of Drake, MCG, Reading Alloys and Muirhead.

EMG’s operating income was $166.6 million for 2009, a
    decrease of $8.6 million or 4.9% when compared with
    $175.2 million in 2008. EMG’s decrease in operating
    income was driven by the decrease in sales noted above,
    predominantly by weakness in the EMIP businesses, which was
    partially offset by profit contributions made by the
    acquisitions mentioned above and the fourth quarter of 2008
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs of
    $19.4 million. EMG’s operating margins were 17.5% of
    sales for 2009 compared with 15.5% of sales in 2008. The
    increase in operating margins was primarily driven by
    Operational Excellence capabilities and cost reduction
    initiatives throughout the Group, including the cost savings
    achieved from the restructuring activities related to the fourth
    quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. The
    fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs of $19.4 million had a negative impact on
    operating margins of 170 basis points.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were
    $523.5 million, a decrease of $100.2 million or 16.1%
    when compared with net sales of $623.7 million for the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for EIG were
    $286.0 million in 2009, a decrease of 20.9% from sales of
    $361.6 million in 2008. Net sales for EMG were
    $237.5 million in 2009, a decrease of 9.4% from sales of
    $262.1 million in 2008. The Company’s internal sales
    decline was approximately 20%, which excludes a 2% favorable
    effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions
    mentioned above offset approximately 2% of the Company’s
    internal sales decline.

The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include
    pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the
    effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per
    diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million),
    as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the
    $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in
    cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges
    and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in
    segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG,
    $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate
    administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans
    established by the Company as part of cost



reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented across the
    Company’s various businesses during fiscal 2009. The
    restructuring costs include the consolidation of manufacturing
    facilities, the migration of production to low cost locales and
    a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of
    expected sales volumes in certain of the Company’s
    businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of
    $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the
    Company’s workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax
    charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs
    associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009. See
    Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements
    included in this

Form 10-K

for further details.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was
    $51.9 million, an increase of $8.1 million or 18.5%
    when compared with $43.8 million for the fourth quarter of
    2008. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009
    was $0.48, an increase of $0.07 or 17.1% when compared with
    $0.41 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Diluted
    earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of
    2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which
    negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Results
    of Operations

In 2008, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
    income and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved
    these results from contributions from acquisitions completed in
    2008 and 2007, as well as internal growth in both EIG and EMG.
    Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a
    continued focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational
    Excellence initiatives.

Net sales for 2008 were $2,531.1 million, an increase of
    $394.2 million or 18.4% when compared with net sales of
    $2,136.9 million in 2007. Net sales for EIG were
    $1,402.7 million in 2008, an increase of 16.9% from sales
    of $1,199.8 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were
    $1,128.5 million in 2008, an increase of 20.4% from sales
    of $937.1 million in 2007. The Company’s internal
    sales growth was approximately 4% in 2008, which excludes a 1%
    favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by
    strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions
    mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales
    increase.

Total international sales for 2008 were $1,225.5 million or
    48.4% of consolidated net sales, an increase of
    $171.8 million or 16.3% when compared with international
    sales of $1,053.7 million or 49.3% of consolidated net
    sales in 2007. The increase in international sales resulted from
    increased international sales from base businesses of
    $29.3 million or 17.0% of the increase, which includes the
    effect of foreign currency translation, as well as the
    acquisitions completed in 2008 and 2007, most notably Cameca SAS
    (“Cameca”), the Repair & Overhaul Division
    of Umeco plc (“Umeco R&O”), Reading Alloys,
    California Instruments Corporation (“California
    Instruments”) and Vision Research. Increased international
    sales came primarily from sales to Europe and Asia by both
    reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States,
    which are included in total international sales, were
    $478.5 million in 2008, an increase of $84.1 million
    or 21.3% compared with $394.4 million in 2007. Export
    shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from the
    base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.

New orders for 2008 were a record at $2,561.5 million, an
    increase of $273.2 million or 11.9% when compared with
    $2,288.3 million in 2007. The increase in new orders was
    primarily due to the recent acquisitions noted above. As a
    result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at
    December 31, 2008 was $718.6 million, an increase of
    $30.4 million or 4.4% when compared with
    $688.2 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in
    backlog was primarily due to the acquired backlog of the recent
    acquisitions noted above.

The year ended December 31, 2008 results include fourth
    quarter pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had
    the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25
    per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs
    for employee reductions and facility closures
    ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs
    ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges,
    $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million
    of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded
    in SG&A expenses. The restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs were reported in segment operating income as
    follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG
    and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other
    expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and
    facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as
    part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented
    across the Company’s various businesses during fiscal 2009.



The restructuring costs include the consolidation of
    manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low
    cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to
    lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the
    Company’s businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges
    of $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of
    the Company’s workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax
    charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs
    associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009.

Segment operating income for 2008 was $481.9 million, an
    increase of $54.4 million or 12.7% when compared with
    segment operating income of $427.5 million in 2007. Segment
    operating income, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 19.0%
    for 2008 from 20.0% in 2007. The increase in segment operating
    income resulted primarily from strength in the Company’s
    differentiated businesses and profit contributions made by the
    acquisitions, partially offset by the fourth quarter pre-tax
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs described above. The
    decrease in segment operating margins resulted primarily from
    the restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which
    negatively impacted segment operating margins by 160 basis
    points.

SG&A expenses for 2008 were $322.6 million, an
    increase of $59.1 million or 22.4% when compared with
    $263.5 million in 2007. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
    expenses were 12.7% for 2008, compared with 12.3% in 2007. The
    increase in SG&A expenses was the result of higher sales,
    as well as a $7.1 million charge — representing a
    0.3% increase in SG&A expenses — recorded in
    corporate administrative expenses related to the accelerated
    vesting of an April 2005 restricted stock grant in the second
    quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million of SG&A expense
    related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and
    asset write-downs described above. Additionally, the
    Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire
    differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution
    channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher
    content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses
    increased approximately 7.9%. Excluding the impact of the fourth
    quarter restructuring charges and asset write-downs on selling
    expense of $6.9 million, a 3.2% impact, and foreign
    currency translation, the increase in 2008 base business selling
    expenses was in line with internal sales growth. Selling
    expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 10.8% for 2008,
    compared with 10.4% in 2007.

Corporate administrative expenses for 2008 were
    $49.2 million, an increase of $8.4 million or 20.6%
    when compared with $40.8 million in 2007. As a percentage
    of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.9%, in both
    2008 and 2007. The increase in corporate administrative expenses
    was primarily the result of equity-based compensation associated
    with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the second
    quarter of 2008, noted above, as well as other expenses
    necessary to grow the Company, partially offset by equity-based
    compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of
    restricted stock in the first and third quarters of 2007.

Consolidated operating income was $432.7 million or 17.1%
    of sales for 2008, an increase of $46.1 million or 11.9%
    when compared with $386.6 million or 18.1% of sales in 2007.

Interest expense was $63.7 million for 2008, an increase of
    $16.8 million or 35.8% when compared with
    $46.9 million in 2007. The increase was due to the impact
    of the funding of the private placement senior notes in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 and the third and fourth quarters of
    2008, higher average borrowings to fund the recent acquisitions
    and the repurchase of 1.3 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock in 2008.

The effective tax rate for 2008 was 32.6% compared with 32.2% in
    2007. The higher effective tax rate for 2008 primarily reflects
    an increase in state and foreign income taxes and the impact of
    accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock
    amortization, offset by the impact of settlements of various
    income tax issues with U.S. taxing authorities and a
    favorable agreement in the United Kingdom related to deductible
    interest expense for which previously unrecognized tax benefits
    were recognized. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 primarily
    reflects an enacted decrease in certain foreign corporate tax
    rates in the second half of 2007, partially offset by the
    elimination of the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial
    Income (“FSC/ETI”) tax benefit.

Net income for 2008 was $247.0 million, an increase of
    $19.0 million or 8.3% when compared with
    $228.0 million in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008
    was $2.30, an increase of $0.18 or 8.5% when compared with $2.12
    per diluted share in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008
    includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted
    earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.



Segment
    Results

EIG’s

sales totaled $1,402.7 million for 2008,
    an increase of $202.9 million or 16.9% when compared with
    $1,199.8 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 5%, excluding a favorable 1%
    effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by
    EIG’s aerospace, power, and process and analytical
    instrument businesses. The acquisitions of Advanced Industries,
    Inc., B&S Aircraft Parts and Accessories, Cameca,
    California Instruments, Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex
    Programmable accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.

EIG’s operating income was $306.8 million for 2008, an
    increase of $46.5 million or 17.9% when compared with
    $260.3 million in 2007. The increases in segment operating
    income were due to the contribution from the higher sales by
    EIG’s aerospace, power and process and analytical
    businesses, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above,
    partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million. EIG’s
    operating margins were 21.9% of sales for 2008 compared with
    21.7% of sales in 2007. The increase in operating margins was
    driven by operational excellence initiatives throughout the
    group. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and
    asset write-downs had a negative impact on EIG’s operating
    margins of 140 basis points.

EMG’s

sales totaled $1,128.5 million for 2008,
    an increase of $191.4 million or 20.4% from
    $937.1 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 2%, excluding a favorable 1%
    effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by
    EMG’s differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of Seacon
    Phoenix, subsequently renamed AMETEK SCP, Inc., Hamilton
    Precision Metals, Umeco R&O, Drake Air, MCG, Reading Alloys
    and Muirhead accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.

EMG’s operating income was $175.2 million for 2008, an
    increase of $8.0 million or 4.8% when compared with
    $167.2 million in 2007. EMG’s increase in operating
    income was primarily due to higher sales from the group’s
    differentiated businesses, which include the acquisitions
    mentioned above, partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs of
    $19.4 million. EMG’s operating margins were 15.5% of
    sales for 2008 compared with 17.8% of sales in 2007. The
    decrease in operating margins was primarily driven by the fourth
    quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs,
    which had a negative impact on operating margins of
    170 basis points. The remainder of the decrease was the
    dilutive impact of recent acquisitions.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were
    $623.7 million, an increase of $40.4 million or 6.9%
    when compared with net sales of $583.3 million for the
    fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales for EIG were
    $361.6 million in 2008, an increase of 7.6% from sales of
    $336.1 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were
    $262.1 million in 2008, an increase of 6.1% from sales of
    $247.1 million in 2007. The Company’s internal sales
    growth was approximately negative 2%, which excludes a 4%
    unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The
    acquisitions mentioned above made up the net sales increase.

The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include
    pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the
    effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per
    diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million),
    as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the
    $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in
    cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges
    and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in
    segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG,
    $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate
    administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans
    established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives
    that were broadly implemented across the Company’s various
    businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include
    the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of
    production to low cost locales and a general reduction in
    workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes
    in certain of the Company’s businesses. The Company
    recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance
    costs for more than 10% of the Company’s workforce. The
    Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for
    lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain
    facilities in 2009.



Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was
    $43.8 million, a decrease of $18.1 million or 29.2%
    when compared with $61.9 million for the fourth quarter of
    2007. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2008
    was $0.41, a decrease of $0.16 or 28.1% when compared with $0.57
    per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted
    earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of
    2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which
    negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $364.7 million in 2009, an increase of $117.4 million
    or 47.5% when compared with $247.3 million in 2008. The
    increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of
    lower overall operating working capital levels, which includes
    the impact of a tax refund received in 2009 that resulted from
    the Company’s higher year end 2008 defined benefit pension
    contributions and $21.1 million in defined benefit pension
    contributions paid in 2009, compared with $79.9 million in
    defined benefit pension contributions paid in 2008. As a result
    of the 2009 and 2008 defined benefit pension plan contributions,
    as well as overall stock market performance in 2009, the
    Company’s overall defined benefit pension plans were over
    funded at December 31, 2009. The increase in cash provided
    by lower overall operating working capital was partially offset
    by the $41.2 million decrease in net income. Free cash flow
    (operating cash flow less capital spending) was
    $331.6 million in 2009, compared to $203.1 million in
    2008. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes,
    depreciation and amortization) was $428.0 million in 2009,
    compared with $489.4 million in 2008, which includes the
    fourth quarter of 2008 pre-tax restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs of $40.0 million. Free cash flow and EBITDA are
    presented because the Company is aware that they are measures
    used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the
    “Notes to Selected Financial Data” included in
    Item 6 for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures to comparable
    non-GAAP measures).

Cash used for investing activities totaled $106.3 million
    in 2009, compared with $496.6 million in 2008. In 2009, the
    Company paid $72.9 million for three business acquisitions,
    net of cash received, compared with $463.0 million paid for
    six business acquisitions and one technology line acquisition,
    net of cash received, in 2008. Additions to property, plant and
    equipment totaled $33.1 million in 2009, compared with
    $44.2 million in 2008.

Cash used for financing activities totaled $102.5 million
    in 2009, compared with $173.5 million of cash provided by
    financing activities in 2008. In 2009, net total borrowings
    decreased by $92.4 million, compared with a net total
    borrowings increase of $266.9 million in 2008. Short-term
    borrowings decreased $13.0 million in 2009, compared with
    an increase of $69.7 million in 2008. Long-term borrowings
    decreased $79.4 million in 2009, compared to an increase of
    $197.2 million in 2008.

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company paid in full a
    40 million British pound ($62.0 million) borrowing
    under the revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter
    of 2009, the Company paid in full a 10.5 million British
    pound ($16.9 million) floating-rate term note.

In May 2009, the Company chose not to renew its
    $100 million accounts receivable securitization facility.
    There were no borrowings under this facility at
    December 31, 2008.

In July 2008, the Company paid in full the $225 million
    7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from
    borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.

The second funding of the third quarter of 2007 private
    placement agreement to sell $450 million occurred in July
    2008 for $80 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.35% senior notes due July 2018. The 2007 private
    placement carries a weighted average interest rate of 6.25%. The
    proceeds from the second funding of the notes were used to pay
    down a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the
    Company’s revolving credit facility.

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September
    2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due
    September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second
    funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million,
    consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due
    December 2018. The senior notes carry a weighted average
    interest rate



of 6.93%. The senior notes are subject to certain customary
    covenants, including financial covenants that, among other
    things, require the Company to maintain certain

debt-to-EBITDA

and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the senior notes
    were used to pay down a portion of the borrowings outstanding
    under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

The Company’s revolving credit facility’s total
    borrowing capacity is $550 million, which includes an
    accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an
    additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at
    any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under
    certain conditions. The term of the facility is June 2012. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had $532.2 million
    available under its revolving credit facility, including the
    $100 million accordion feature. At December 31, 2009,
    no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility.

At December 31, 2009, total debt outstanding was
    $1,041.7 million, compared with $1,111.7 million at
    December 31, 2008, with no significant maturities until
    2012. The

debt-to-capital

ratio was 39.9% at December 31, 2009, compared with 46.3%
    at December 31, 2008. The net

debt-to-capital

ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the
    sum of net debt and stockholders’ equity) was 33.7% at
    December 31, 2009, compared with 44.3% at December 31,
    2008. The net

debt-to-capital

ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this
    measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See
    the “Notes to Selected Financial Data” included in
    Item 6 for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to
    comparable non-GAAP measures).

Additional financing activities for 2009 include the receipt of
    net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of
    $11.6 million compared with $7.5 million in 2008. Cash
    dividends paid were $25.6 million in 2009, compared with
    $25.7 million in 2008. In 2008, the Company repaid
    $21.4 million in life insurance policy loans.

Repurchases of 1.3 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock in 2008 totaled $57.4 million. No shares were
    repurchased in 2009. At December 31, 2009,
    $68.5 million was available under the current Board
    authorization for future share repurchases. On January 28,
    2010, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of
    $75 million in the authorization for the repurchase of its
    common stock. This increase was added to the $68.5 million
    that remained available from existing authorizations approved in
    2008, for a total of $143.5 million available for
    repurchases of the Company’s common stock. Subsequent to
    December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased 1,128,200 shares
    of its common stock for approximately $41.8 million. The
    remaining balance available for repurchases of the
    Company’s common stock is $101.7 million as of the
    filing of this report.

As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in
    2009, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009
    totaled $246.4 million, compared with $87.0 million at
    December 31, 2008. Additionally, the Company is in
    compliance with all of its debt covenants, which includes its
    financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company
    believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from
    domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit
    facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to
    meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the
    foreseeable future.

Other
    Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of
    $20.4 million related to performance and payment guarantees
    at December 31, 2009. Based on experience with these
    arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may
    arise will not be material to its financial position.

The Company may, from time to time, repurchase its long-term
    debt in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon
    availability, market conditions and other factors.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as
    those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on
    the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations and that require the use of complex and
    subjective estimates based upon past experience and
    management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent
    in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the
    estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and
    related notes contain information that is pertinent to the
    Company’s accounting policies and to Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents
    additional specific disclosures about the Company’s
    accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective
    decisions or assessments whereby materially different results of
    operations and financial condition could have been reported had
    different assumptions been used or different conditions existed.
    Primary disclosure of the Company’s significant accounting
    policies is in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is
    complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the
    customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under
    which title and risk of loss have been transferred,
    collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or
    determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and
    risk



of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes
    revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other
    criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with
    respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that
    the customer may not return products or be given allowances,
    except at the Company’s option. The Company has agreements
    with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return
    for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from
    the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to
    the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
    incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume
    discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a
    reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for
    sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are
    provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past
    experience. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    accrual for future warranty obligations was $16.0 million,
    $16.1 million and $14.4 million, respectively. The
    Company’s expense for warranty obligations was
    $8.2 million, $12.2 million and $11.3 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The warranty periods for
    products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations,
    but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company
    calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty
    experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect
    actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and
    allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience,
    additional accruals may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains
    allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
    specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the
    Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against
    the amount due from these customers. For all other customers,
    the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the
    length of time specific receivables are past due based on its
    historical experience. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their
    inability to make payments, additional allowances may be
    required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $5.8 million and $8.5 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which
    approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 66% of
    its inventories at December 31, 2009. The

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to
    determine cost for the remaining 34% of its inventory at
    December 31, 2009. For inventories where cost is determined
    by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been
    $20.8 million and $30.8 million higher than the LIFO
    value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company
    provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and
    obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future
    demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing
    financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If
    these factors are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
    Assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with
    indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not
    amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least
    annually. The impairment test for goodwill requires a two-step
    process. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit’s net assets to the fair value of the
    reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no
    further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is
    recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then
    the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the
    fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability,
    with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss
    occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the
    implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record such
    impairment losses.

The Company identifies its reporting units at the component
    level, which is one level below our operating segments.
    Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific
    operating companies and is assigned to the reporting units based
    upon the reporting unit in which that operating company resides.
    Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level
    below our operating segment at which discrete financial
    information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment
    management.

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow
    analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
    which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an
    appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market
    participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to
    determine the fair



value of its reporting units in a sales transaction. The annual
    goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number
    of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue
    growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and
    working capital requirements, which are based upon the
    Company’s long range plan. The Company’s long range
    plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is
    reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an
    estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a
    market participant whose weighted average cost of capital
    includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While
    the Company uses the best available information to prepare its
    cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash
    flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting
    in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill
    balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to
    reflect changing business and market conditions, the
    Company’s overall methodology and the population of
    assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate
    the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill
    impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease
    in fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as
    a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting
    unit) from this hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value ranged
    from an excess of the fair values of the Company’s
    reporting units over their respective carrying values of 22% to
    411% for each of the Company’s reporting units.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than
    goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a
    comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible
    asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment
    testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its
    indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty
    method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a
    widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value
    derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the
    discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such
    trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for
    their use.

The Company’s acquisitions have generally included a
    significant goodwill component and the Company expects to
    continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2009,
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled
    $1,447.4 million, or 44.6% of the Company’s total
    assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment
    tests in the fourth quarter of 2009 and determined that the
    Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were
    not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or
    indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the
    future.

Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
    carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of
    other intangible assets with finite lives are considered
    impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from
    those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a
    loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying
    value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market
    value is determined primarily using present value techniques
    based on projected cash flows from the asset group.

•

Pensions.

The Company has U.S. and
    foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
    The most significant elements in determining the Company’s
    pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability
    discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The
    pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at
    which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation
    date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the
    assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities.
    In estimating this rate for 2009, the Company considered rates
    of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have
    maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements
    of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2009
    pension cost was 6.50% for U.S. defined benefit pension
    plans and 6.09% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for
    determining the funded status of the plans at December 31,
    2009 and determining the 2010 defined benefit pension cost is
    5.90% for U.S. plans and 5.98% for foreign plans. In
    estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the
    Company’s actuaries developed a customized discount rate
    appropriate to the plans’ projected benefit cash flow based
    on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at
    consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2009 of 8.25% for
    U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.97% for foreign
    plans. The Company will continue to use these rates for 2010 for
    the U.S. and foreign plans, respectively. The Company
    determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily
    on its expectation of future returns for the



pension plans’ investments. Additionally, the Company
    considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income
    investments and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as
    deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in
    determining the 2009 pension expense for the U.S. plans was
    3.75% and was 2.98% for the foreign plans. Both the
    U.S. and foreign plans’ rates of compensation will
    remain unchanged in 2010. For the year ended December 31,
    2009, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension
    expense of $10.3 million from its U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit pension plans as compared with pre-tax pension
    income of $6.8 million recognized for these plans in 2008.
    The Company estimates its 2010 U.S. and foreign defined
    benefit pension plans pre-tax income to be approximately
    $1.6 million.

All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition
    obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been
    recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other
    comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in stockholders’
    equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic
    pension cost. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date
    (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are
    measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its
    defined benefit pension plans during 2009 which totaled
    $21.1 million, compared with $79.9 million in 2008.
    The Company anticipates making approximately $2.0 million
    to $5.0 million in cash contributions to its defined
    benefit pension plans in 2010.

•

Income Taxes.

The process of providing for
    income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts
    requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments
    regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a
    broad range of operations around the world and is therefore
    subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international
    taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes
    and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain.
    Management must make judgments currently about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax
    assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs,
    future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and
    liabilities may be necessary.

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax
    assets, taking into consideration the Company’s forecast of
    future taxable income, available net operating loss
    carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could
    be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this
    assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the
    amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s
    deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances
    change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances
    may be required.

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by
    applying a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
    required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the
    financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a
    more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates
    is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax
    benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the
    highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be
    realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax
    examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based
    on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax
    audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or
    by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There
    can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be
    realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and
    audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
    accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2010-06,

Fair value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASU

2010-06”).

ASU

2010-06

provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and
    require new disclosures related to fair value measurements,
    particularly to provide greater disaggregated information on
    each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures
    on transfers between levels 1 and 2 and activity in
    level 3 fair value measurements. The new disclosures and
    clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim
    and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
    2009, except for the disclosures about activity in level 3
    fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for
    interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU

2010-06

on
    our fair value measurement disclosures.



In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-14,

Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

(“ASU

2009-14”).

ASU

2009-14

provides guidance for revenue arrangements that include both
    tangible products and software elements that are “essential
    to the functionality of the hardware.” ASU

2009-14

provides factors to help constituents determine what software
    elements are considered essential to the functionality of the
    tangible product. This guidance will now subject
    software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and
    disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue
    arrangements with multiple-deliverables. ASU

2009-14

is
    effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
    modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
    2010 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
    position and cash flows.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

(“ASU

2009-13”).

ASU

2009-13

provides guidance on accounting and reporting for arrangements
    including multiple revenue-generating activities. ASU

2009-13

provides guidance for separating deliverables, measuring and
    allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of
    accounting. ASU

2009-13

also
    requires significantly expanded disclosures to provide
    information about a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue
    arrangements and the judgments made by the vendor that affect
    the timing or amount of revenue recognition. ASU

2009-13

is
    effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010 and is not expected to have a significant
    impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations,
    financial position and cash flows.

In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-05,

Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value

(“ASU

2009-05”),

which provides clarification on the application of fair value
    techniques when a quoted price in an active market for the
    identical liability is not available and clarifies that when
    estimating the fair value of a liability, the fair value is not
    adjusted to reflect the impact of contractual restrictions that
    prevent its transfer. ASU

2009-05

was
    effective on October 1, 2009 for the Company and the
    adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash
    flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 168,

The FASB Accounting
    Standards
    Codification

tm

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
    a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162

(“SFAS 168”). SFAS 168 identifies the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles used in the preparation of financial statements
    of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity
    with GAAP in the United States (the “GAAP hierarchy”).
    Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) under authority of federal
    securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
    registrants. SFAS 168 was effective for financial
    statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 168 did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

In May 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) Subsequent Events Topic 855, (“ASC
    855”). ASC 855 establishes general standards of accounting
    for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet
    date but before financial statements are issued or are available
    to be issued. ASC 855 was effective for interim and annual
    reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption
    of ASC 855 did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash
    flows. The Company evaluated all events and transactions that
    occurred after December 31, 2009 up through
    February 25, 2010, the date the Company issued these
    financial statements. During this period, the Company did not
    have any material recognizable or non-recognizable subsequent
    events.

The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance
    with FASB ASC Business Combinations Topic 805 (“ASC
    805”), which includes provisions adopted effective
    January 1, 2009. The accounting for business combinations
    retains the underlying concepts of the previously issued
    standard, but changes the method of applying the acquisition
    method in a number of significant aspects. These changes were
    effective on a prospective basis for business combinations for
    which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009,
    with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on
    deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. Adjustments for
    valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax
    contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to
    January 1, 2009 would also apply the revised accounting for
    business combination provisions. The adoption of certain
    provisions within ASC 805 effective January 1, 2009 did not
    have a significant impact on the Company’s



consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows. However, depending on the nature of an acquisition or the
    quantity of acquisitions entered into after the adoption, ASC
    805 may significantly impact the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows and result in more earnings volatility and generally lower
    earnings due to, among other items, the expensing of transaction
    costs and restructuring costs of acquired companies.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

820-10-65-4,

Transition Related to FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-4,

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for
    the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
    Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly

(“ASC

820-10-65-4”).

ASC

820-10-65-4

amends ASC 820, and provides additional guidance for estimating
    fair value in accordance with ASC 820 when the volume and level
    of activity for the asset or liability have significantly
    decreased and also includes guidance on identifying
    circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly for
    fair value measurements. ASC

820-10-65-4

is applied prospectively with retrospective application not
    permitted. ASC

820-10-65-4

was effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC

820-10-65-4

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

320-10-65-1,

Transition Related to FASB Staff Position

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments

(“ASC

320-10-65-1”).

ASC

320-10-65-1

amends previously issued standards to make the

other-than-temporary

impairments guidance more operational and to improve the
    presentation of

other-than-temporary

impairments in the financial statements. ASC

320-10-65-1

replaces the existing requirement that the entity’s
    management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an
    impaired debt security until recovery with a requirement that
    management assert it does not have the intent to sell the
    security, and it is more likely than not it will not have to
    sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. ASC

320-10-65-1

provides increased disclosure about the credit and noncredit
    components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to
    be sold and also requires increased and more frequent
    disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses and an
    aging of securities with unrealized losses. Although ASC

320-10-65-1

does not result in a change in the carrying amount of debt
    securities, it does require that the portion of an

other-than-temporary

impairment not related to a credit loss for a

held-to-maturity

security be recognized in a new category of other comprehensive
    income and be amortized over the remaining life of the debt
    security as an increase in the carrying value of the security.
    ASC

320-10-65-1

was effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC

320-10-65-1

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

825-10-65-1,

Transition Related to FASB Staff Position

FAS 107-1

and Accounting Principles Board

28-1,

Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(“ASC

825-10-65-1”).

ASC

825-10-65-1

amends previously issued standards to require disclosures about
    fair value of financial instruments not measured on the balance
    sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as well as
    in annual financial statements. Prior to ASC

825-10-65-1,

fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed
    annually. ASC

825-10-65-1

applies to all financial instruments within the scope of ASC 825
    and requires all entities to disclose the methods and
    significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments. ASC

825-10-65-1

was effective for interim periods ending after June 15,
    2009. See Note 15.

Internal
    Reinvestment

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $33.1 million or 1.6% of sales in
    2009, compared with $44.2 million or 1.7% of sales in 2008.
    56% of the expenditures in 2009 were for improvements to
    existing equipment or additional equipment to increase
    productivity and expand capacity. The Company’s 2009
    capital expenditures decreased due to the global economic
    recession with a continuing emphasis on spending to improve
    productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2010
    capital expenditures are expected to approximate 2.0% of sales,
    with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.

Product
    Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development



and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were
    $101.4 million, $115.9 million and $102.9 million
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Customer reimbursements in
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were $5.5 million, $6.1 million
    and $7.1 million, respectively. These amounts included net
    Company-funded research and development expenses of
    $50.5 million, $57.5 million and $52.9 million,
    respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the
    development of new products and processes and the improvement of
    existing products and processes.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
    existing at that time, at December 31, 2009, the Company is
    named a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) at 16

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a
    “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the
    low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the
    amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites,
    the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the
    de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting
    executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement
    amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company
    is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
    attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
    responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an
    appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where
    the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is
    participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
    issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
    this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites,
    the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
    probable remediation activities at certain of its current or
    previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned”
    sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with
    respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established
    once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
    estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through
    the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
    feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
    instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for
    such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
    the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of
    remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current
    estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial
    statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not
    expected to result in a material change to the consolidated
    financial statements. In estimating the Company’s liability
    for remediation, the Company also considers the likely
    proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and
    the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2009 and 2008
    were $27.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively,
    for non-owned and owned sites. In 2009, the Company received
    $1.3 million of additional reserves from a third party for
    existing sites. Additionally, the Company spent
    $2.7 million on environmental matters in 2009. The
    Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 include reserves of
    $19.2 million and $17.9 million, respectively, for an
    owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005
    acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is
    the designated performing party for the performance of remedial
    activities for one of several operating units making up a large
    Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The
    Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial
    assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of
    the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company has $13.9 million in receivables related to HCC for
    probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other
    committed third-party funds to support the required remediation.
    Also, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for
    approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain
    of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously
    owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or
    new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
    Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
    under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other
    parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental
    matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in
    all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for
    bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, as discussed further in the
    following paragraph.

In August 2009, the Company agreed to a Stipulation and
    Settlement Agreement with the San Diego Regional Water
    Quality Control Board regarding the 2008 Notice of
    Administrative Civil Liability related to a former



subsidiary which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for
    bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, whereby the Company paid and
    deferred minor penalties, which were covered by previously
    establish reserves.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are
    sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing
    claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe
    that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations
    in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon
    presently available information and past experience related to
    such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been
    made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not
    expected to materially affect the consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Market
    Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are
    fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
    and commodity prices, which could impact its results of
    operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its
    exposure to these risks through its normal operating and
    financing activities. The Company’s differentiated and
    global business activities help to reduce the impact that any
    particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a
    whole.

The Company’s short-term debt carries variable interest
    rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates.
    These financial instruments are more fully described in the
    notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most
    significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British
    pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and the Mexican
    peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is
    monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional
    use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in
    the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign
    subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is
    included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant
    effect on the operating results reported by the Company because
    revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally
    transacted in the same foreign currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure
    are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel,
    titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these
    commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in
    selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order
    pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes
    used to manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest
    rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the
    Company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in
    future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial
    instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual
    effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain matters discussed in this

Form 10-K

are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
    (“PSLRA”), which involve risk and uncertainties that
    exist in the Company’s operations and business environment
    and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or
    unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be
    important in determining the Company’s actual future
    results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe
    harbor” provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that
    numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in
    the future could cause, the Company’s actual results to
    differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
    statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not
    all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ from present expectations are set forth above
    and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no
    obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or
    otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

Management’s
    Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
    the consolidated financial statements and related information.
    The statements are prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently
    applied and include certain amounts based on management’s
    best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
    elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
    financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
    financial information, management maintains a system of internal
    accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
    program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
    division of responsibility and the application of written
    policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
    reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
    preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
    of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and
    presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however,
    there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
    system of internal controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
    Company’s activities according to the highest standards of
    personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
    characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
    all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
    Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
    other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
    Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
    firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
    that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
    report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
    of the Company for its 2010 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
    registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
    direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an
    opinion as to whether management’s financial statements
    present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s
    financial position and operating results. This report is
    included on page 41.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in the Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on the
    framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that
    evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2009.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, which appears on page 40.

    included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 25,
    2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
    stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 25, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis of
    Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
    operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
    (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the
    Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany
    transactions in the consolidation. The Company’s
    investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted
    for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not
    significant to the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Cash
    Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
    less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, all of the Company’s
    equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those
    of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as

“available-for-sale,”

although the Company may hold fixed-income securities until
    their maturity dates. Fixed-income securities generally mature
    within three years. The aggregate market value of equity and
    fixed-income securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
    $13.2 million ($13.5 million amortized cost) and
    $11.9 million ($12.9 million amortized cost),
    respectively. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such
    securities is recorded as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (in stockholders’ equity), and
    is not significant. The Company had $0.2 million of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses in 2008. Certain of the Company’s other
    investments, which are not significant, are also accounted for
    by the equity method of accounting as discussed above.

Accounts
    Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
    from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
    obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
    receivables is recorded against the amount due from these
    customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
    reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
    specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The
    allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $5.8 million and $8.5 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 8.

Inventories

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which
    approximates current replacement cost, for 66% of its
    inventories at December 31, 2009. The

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to
    determine cost for the remaining 34% of the Company’s
    inventory at December 31, 2009. For inventories where cost
    is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value
    over the LIFO value was $20.8 million and
    $30.8 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves
    for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current
    assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers
    who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related
    management initiatives.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
    for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
    lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies,
    and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
    incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
    principally on a straight-line basis over



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of
    lives for depreciable assets is generally three to ten years for
    machinery and equipment, five to 27 years for leasehold
    improvements and 25 to 50 years for buildings.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
    when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when
    products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of
    an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have
    been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of
    sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery,
    the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer,
    assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The
    policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances, generally
    provides that the customer may not return products or be given
    allowances, except at the Company’s option. The Company has
    agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights
    of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the
    product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss
    transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer
    substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors
    other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for these
    sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is
    recognized in the income statement. Accruals for sales returns,
    other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at
    the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the accrual for future
    warranty obligations was $16.0 million, $16.1 million
    and $14.4 million, respectively. The Company’s expense
    for warranty obligations was $8.2 million in 2009,
    $12.2 million in 2008 and $11.3 million in 2007. The
    warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the
    Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed
    one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision
    based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made
    periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Research
    and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
    operations as incurred and were $50.5 million in 2009,
    $57.5 million in 2008 and $52.9 million in 2007.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and
    were $24.6 million in 2009, $34.0 million in 2008 and
    $27.5 million in 2007.

Earnings
    Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
    weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding
    during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per
    share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities
    (principally outstanding common stock options and restricted
    stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the
    calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per
    share were as follows for the years ended December 31:

    Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
    using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and
    their results of operations are translated using average
    exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company
    and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their
    functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those
    transactions are included in operating results for the year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
    instruments. Forward contracts are entered into from time to
    time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain inventory
    purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the Company’s
    exposure to raw material commodity price or foreign currency
    fluctuation. No forward contracts were outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. During 2008, the Company was
    party to certain commodity price forward contracts pertaining to
    raw materials, which were not significant. These forward
    contracts were acquired as a part of a 2008 acquisition. In
    instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an
    underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (“AOCI”) within stockholders’ equity to the
    extent they are effective as hedges. The Company has designated
    certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of
    the net investment in certain foreign operations. These net
    investment hedges are the Company’s
    British-pound-denominated long-term debt and Euro-denominated
    long-term debt, pertaining to certain European acquisitions
    whose functional currencies are either the British pound or the
    Euro. These acquisitions were financed by
    foreign-currency-denominated borrowings under the Company’s
    revolving credit facility and were subsequently refinanced with
    long-term private placement debt. These borrowings were designed
    to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign
    subsidiaries on their respective dates of acquisition. On the
    respective dates of acquisition, the Company designated the
    British pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as
    hedging instruments to offset foreign exchange gains or losses
    on the net investment in the acquired business due to changes in
    the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment
    hedges were evidenced by management’s documentation
    supporting the contemporaneous hedge designation on the
    acquisition dates. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument
    following hedge designation (the debt), is reported in AOCI in
    the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment
    based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure
    hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, all
    net investment hedges were effective. At December 31, 2009,
    the translation gains on the net carrying value of the
    foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the
    translation losses on the carrying value of the underlying debt
    and the difference is included in AOCI. At December 31,
    2008, the translation losses on the net carrying value of the
    foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the
    translation gains on the carrying value of the underlying debt
    and the difference is included in AOCI. An evaluation of hedge
    effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis
    and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate. See
    Note 4.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
    Compensation — Stock Compensation Topic 718.
    Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made
    under its share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements over the requisite service
    period of the grants. See Note 11.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives,
    primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather,
    they are tested for impairment at least annually.

The Company identifies its reporting units at the component
    level, which is one level below our operating segments.
    Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific
    operating companies and is assigned to the reporting units based
    upon the reporting unit in which that operating company resides.
    Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level
    below our operating segment at which discrete financial
    information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment
    management.



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow
    analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
    which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an
    appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market
    participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to
    determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sales
    transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the
    Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning
    future levels of revenue growth, operating margins,
    depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements,
    which are based upon the Company’s long range plan. The
    Company’s long range plan is updated as part of its annual
    planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The
    discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of
    return required by a market participant whose weighted average
    cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk
    premium. While the Company uses the best available information
    to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual
    future cash flows or market conditions could differ
    significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to
    recorded goodwill balances.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than
    goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a
    comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible
    asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment
    testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its
    indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty
    method. The relief from royalty method is measured as the
    discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such
    trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for
    their use.

The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in
    the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008 and 2007 and determined that
    the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with
    indefinite lives were not impaired.

The Company evaluates impairment of its long-lived assets, other
    than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets when events
    or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
    be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group
    is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted
    cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and
    are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is
    recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value
    exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
    Fair market value is determined primarily using present value
    techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
    Losses on long-lived assets

held-for-sale,

other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are
    determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values
    are reduced for disposal costs.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents are being
    amortized over useful lives of four to 20 years. Customer
    relationships are being amortized over a period of two to
    20 years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being
    amortized over a period of four to 20 years. The Company
    periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated
    useful lives of these intangible assets.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s annual provision for income taxes and
    determination of the related balance sheet accounts requires
    management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding
    outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad
    range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to
    complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing
    jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and
    potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain.
    Management must make judgments currently about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax
    assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs,
    future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and
    liabilities may be necessary. The Company recognizes interest
    and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in
    income tax expense.

The Company also is required to assess the realizability of its
    deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the
    Company’s forecast of future taxable income, the reversal
    of other existing temporary differences, available net operating
    loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that
    could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based
    on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and
    amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s
    deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances
    change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances
    may be required.

Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2010-06,

Fair value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASU

2010-06”).

ASU

2010-06

provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and
    require new disclosures related to fair value measurements,
    particularly to provide greater disaggregated information on
    each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures
    on transfers between levels 1 and 2 and activity in
    level 3 fair value measurements. The new disclosures and
    clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim
    and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
    2009, except for the disclosures about activity in level 3
    fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for
    interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU

2010-06

on
    our fair value measurement disclosures.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-14,

Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

(“ASU

2009-14”).

ASU

2009-14

provides guidance for revenue arrangements that include both
    tangible products and software elements that are “essential
    to the functionality of the hardware.” ASU

2009-14

provides factors to help constituents determine what software
    elements are considered essential to the functionality of the
    tangible product. This guidance will now subject
    software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and
    disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue
    arrangements with multiple-deliverables. ASU

2009-14

is
    effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
    modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
    2010 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
    position and cash flows.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

(“ASU

2009-13”).

ASU

2009-13

provides guidance on accounting and reporting for arrangements
    including multiple revenue-generating activities. ASU

2009-13

provides guidance for separating deliverables, measuring and
    allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of
    accounting. ASU

2009-13

also
    requires significantly expanded disclosures to provide
    information about a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue
    arrangements and the judgments made by the vendor that affect
    the timing or amount of revenue recognition. ASU

2009-13

is
    effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010 and is not expected to have a significant
    impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations,
    financial position and cash flows.

In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-05,

Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value

(“ASU

2009-05”),

which provides clarification on the application of fair value
    techniques when a quoted price in an active market for the
    identical liability is not available and clarifies that when
    estimating the fair value of a liability, the fair value is not
    adjusted to reflect the impact of contractual restrictions that
    prevent its transfer. ASU

2009-05

was
    effective on October 1, 2009 for the Company and the
    adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash
    flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 168,

The FASB Accounting
    Standards
    Codification

tm

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
    a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162

(“SFAS 168”). SFAS 168 identifies the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles used in the preparation of financial statements
    of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity
    with GAAP in the United States (the “GAAP hierarchy”).
    Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) under authority of federal
    securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
    registrants. SFAS 168 was effective for financial
    statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 168 did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC Subsequent Events Topic 855,
    (“ASC 855”). ASC 855 establishes general standards of
    accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the
    balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or
    are available to be issued. ASC 855 was effective for interim
    and annual reporting periods



AMETEK,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 855 did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company
    evaluated all events and transactions that occurred after
    December 31, 2009 up through February 25, 2010, the
    date the Company issued these financial statements. During this
    period, the Company did not have any material recognizable or
    non-recognizable subsequent events.

The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance
    with FASB ASC Business Combinations Topic 805 (“ASC
    805”), which includes provisions adopted effective
    January 1, 2009. The accounting for business combinations
    retains the underlying concepts of the previously issued
    standard, but changes the method of applying the acquisition
    method in a number of significant aspects. These changes were
    effective on a prospective basis for business combinations for
    which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009,
    with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on
    deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. Adjustments for
    valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax
    contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to
    January 1, 2009 would also apply the revised accounting for
    business combination provisions. The adoption of certain
    provisions within ASC 805 effective January 1, 2009 did not
    have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
    However, depending on the nature of an acquisition or the
    quantity of acquisitions entered into after the adoption, ASC
    805 may significantly impact the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows and result in more earnings volatility and generally lower
    earnings due to, among other items, the expensing of transaction
    costs and restructuring costs of acquired companies.

ASC 320-10-65-1

replaces the existing requirement that the entity’s

    impaired debt security until recovery with a requirement that
    management assert it does not have the intent to sell the
    security, and it is more likely than not it will not have to
    sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. ASC

320-10-65-1

provides increased disclosure about the credit and noncredit
    components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to
    be sold and also requires increased and more frequent
    disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses and an
    aging of securities with unrealized losses. Although ASC

320-10-65-1

does not result in a change in the carrying amount of debt
    securities, it does require that the portion of an

other-than-temporary

impairment not related to a credit loss for a

held-to-maturity

security be recognized in a new category of other comprehensive
    income and be amortized over the remaining life of the debt
    security as an increase in the carrying value of the security.

    significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments. ASC

825-10-65-1

was effective for interim periods ending after June 15,
    2009. See Note 15.

3.   Fair
    Value Measurement

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
    received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
    price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date.

The Company adopted ASC 820 as of January 1, 2008, with the
    exception of the application of the statement to nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are measured or
    disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis, which was
    delayed by ASC

820-10-65-1,

Transition Related to FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,

to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008, which the Company
    adopted January 1, 2009.

The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the
    inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This
    hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
    follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2
    inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
    liability, either directly or indirectly through market
    corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on
    the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and
    liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s
    classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
    lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

At December 31, 2009, $0.3 million of the
    Company’s cash and cash equivalents as well as
    $5.0 million of marketable securities are valued as
    level 1 investments. In addition, the Company held
    $8.9 million of investments in fixed-income securities
    valued as level 2 investments in the investments and other
    assets line of the consolidated balance sheet. For the year
    ended December 31, 2009, gains and losses on the
    investments noted above were not significant.

Hedging
    Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued ASC

815-10-65-1,

Transition and Effective Date Related to FASB Statement
    No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

(“ASC

815-10-65-1”).

ASC

815-10-65-1

requires entities to provide enhanced disclosure about how and
    why the entity uses derivative instruments, how the instruments
    and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC 815, and
    how the instruments and related hedged items affect the
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
    entity.

The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated
    long-term debt as hedges of the net investment in certain
    foreign operations. These net investment hedges are the
    Company’s British-pound-denominated long-term debt and
    Euro-denominated long-term debt, pertaining to certain European
    acquisitions whose functional currencies are either the British
    pound or the Euro. These acquisitions were financed by
    foreign-currency-denominated borrowings under the Company’s
    revolving credit facility and subsequently refinanced with
    long-term private placement debt. These borrowings were designed
    to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign
    subsidiaries on their respective dates of acquisition. On the
    respective dates of acquisition, the Company designated the
    British pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as
    hedging instruments to offset foreign exchange gains or losses
    on the net investment in the acquired business due to changes in
    the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment
    hedges were evidenced by management’s documentation
    supporting the contemporaneous hedge designation on the
    acquisition dates. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument

following hedge designation (the debt), is reported in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the
    translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the
    spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $145.5 million
    of British pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a
    hedge against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries
    acquired in 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had $189.7 million of British pound-denominated
    loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net
    investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in 2008, 2004 and
    2003. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had
    $71.6 million and $69.8 million, respectively, of
    Euro-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against
    the net investment in a foreign subsidiary acquired in 2005. As
    a result of these British pound- and Euro-denominated loans
    being designated and effective as net investment hedges,
    $15.9 million of currency remeasurement losses and
    $55.6 million of currency remeasurement gains have been
    included in the foreign currency translation component of other
    comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Fourth
    Quarter of 2008 Restructuring Charges and Asset
    Write-Downs

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax
    charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of
    reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted
    share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee
    reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well
    as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). The charges included
    $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the
    Company’s workforce and $1.5 million for lease
    termination costs associated with the closure of certain
    facilities. Of the $40.0 million in charges,
    $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million
    of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded
    in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in
    2008 segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in
    Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”),
    $19.4 million in Electromechanical Group (“EMG”)
    and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other
    expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and
    facility closures relate to plans established by the Company in
    2008 as part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly
    implemented across the Company’s various businesses during
    fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs resulted from the
    consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of
    production to low cost locales and a general reduction in
    workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes
    in certain of the Company’s businesses.

The following table provides a rollforward of the accruals
    established in the fourth quarter of 2008 for restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs:

    and oxygen supply systems. High Standard Aviation and Ameron
    Global are a part of EMG.

The operating results of the above acquisitions have been
    included in the Company’s consolidated results from the
    respective dates of acquisitions.

The purchase price and initial recording of the transactions for
    Ameron Global were based on preliminary valuation assessments
    and are subject to change. The following table represents the
    provisional allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the
    net assets of the above acquisitions based on their estimated

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits
    the Company expects to realize from the acquisitions as High
    Standard Aviation and Ameron Global broaden the global footprint
    of AMETEK’s aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul
    business. No goodwill recorded as part of the 2009 acquisitions
    will be tax deductible in future years.

The Company is in the process of conducting third-party
    valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired.
    Adjustments to the allocation of purchase price will be recorded
    when this information is finalized. Therefore, the allocation of
    the purchase price is subject to revision.

The valuations for the $36.1 million preliminarily assigned
    to other intangible assets have been or are currently being
    finalized by third-party appraisers. In connection with the
    finalization of the 2008 acquisitions, $192.9 million was
    assigned to intangible assets, which consists primarily of
    patents, technology and customer relationships with estimated
    useful lives ranging from five years to 20 years and
    tradenames with indefinite lives.

In 2008, the Company spent a total of approximately
    $463.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired, for six
    acquisitions and one small technology line. The acquisitions

AMETEK,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2005, the Company issued a 50 million Euro
    ($71.6 million at December 31,
    2009) 3.94% senior note due August 2015. In November
    2004, the Company issued a 40 million British pound
    ($64.7 million at December 31,
    2009) 5.99% senior note due in November 2016. In
    September 2003, the Company issued a 50 million British
    pound ($80.8 million at December 31,
    2009) 5.96% senior note due in September 2010.

The Company had an accounts receivable securitization facility
    agreement with a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary and
    the special-purpose subsidiary had a receivables sale agreement
    with a bank, whereby it could sell to a third party up to
    $100.0 million of its trade accounts receivable on a
    revolving basis. The securitization facility was a financing
    vehicle utilized by the Company previously because it offered
    attractive rates relative to other financing sources. When
    borrowings were outstanding under the facility, all securitized
    accounts receivable and related debt were reflected on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The special-purpose subsidiary was the servicer of the accounts
    receivable under the securitization facility. The accounts
    receivable securitization facility was not renewed by the
    Company in May 2009. Interest rates on amounts drawn down were
    based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper
    plus a program fee. The Company also paid a commitment fee on
    any unused commitments under the securitization facility. The
    Company’s accounts receivable securitization was accounted
    for as a secured borrowing.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings
    outstanding on the accounts receivable securitization. Interest
    expense under this facility was not significant. The weighted
    average interest rate when borrowings were outstanding under the
    accounts receivable securitization during 2008 was 3.6%.

The Company’s revolving credit facility’s total
    borrowing capacity is $550 million, which includes an
    accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an
    additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at
    any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under
    certain conditions. The term of the facility is June 2012.

The revolving credit facility places certain restrictions on
    allowable additional indebtedness. At December 31, 2009,
    the Company had available borrowing capacity of
    $532.2 million under its $550 million revolving bank
    credit facility, which includes an accordion feature allowing
    $100 million of additional borrowing capacity.

Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit
    facility are at the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate
    (“LIBOR”) rate plus a negotiated spread, or at the
    U.S. prime rate. At December 31, 2009, the Company had
    no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
    At December 31, 2008, the Company had $65.6 million
    borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, of
    which $58.4 million related to 40 million of British
    pound borrowings under the revolver. The weighted average
    interest rate on the revolving credit facility for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 0.60% and 2.81%,
    respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of credit
    totaling $19.8 million and $15.5 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The private placement, the floating-rate term loan, the senior
    notes and the revolving credit facility are subject to certain
    customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among
    other things, require the Company to maintain certain

debt-to-EBITDA

and interest coverage ratios. The Company was in compliance with
    all provisions of the debt arrangements at December 31,
    2009.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
    facilities with local foreign lenders of $50.3 million at
    December 31, 2009. Foreign subsidiaries had debt
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 totaling
    $24.6 million, including $19.6 million reported in
    long-term debt.

The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 6.4% and 6.2%, respectively.

On both January 24, 2008 and July 23, 2008, the Board
    of Directors authorized increases of $50 million for the
    repurchase of common stock for a total of $100 million in
    2008. These increases were added to the $25.9 million that
    remained available at December 31, 2007 from an existing
    $50 million authorization approved in March 2003. The
    Company did not repurchase shares in 2009. In 2008, the Company
    repurchased approximately 1,263,000 shares of common stock
    for $57.4 million in cash under its current share
    repurchase authorization. At December 31, 2009,
    $68.5 million of the current share repurchase authorization
    remained available. On January 28, 2010, the Board of
    Directors authorized an increase of $75 million in the
    authorization for the repurchase of its common stock. This
    increase was added to the $68.5 million that remained
    available from existing $100 million authorizations
    approved in 2008, for a total of $143.5 million available
    for repurchases of the Company’s common stock. Subsequent
    to December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased 1,128,200
    shares of its common stock for approximately $41.8 million.
    The remaining balance available for repurchases of the
    Company’s common stock is $101.7 million as of the
    filing of this report.

At December 31, 2009, the Company held 3.1 million
    shares in its treasury at a cost of $83.3 million, compared
    with 3.5 million shares at a cost of $92.0 million at
    December 31, 2008. The number of shares outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 was 107.9 million shares, compared
    with 106.7 million shares at December 31, 2008.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
    Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one
    Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the close
    of business on June 2, 2007, and has authorized the
    issuance of one Right for each share of common stock of the
    Company issued between the Record Date and the Distribution
    Date. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving
    acquisition of the Company’s common stock, that holders of
    Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be entitled
    (i) to purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified
    exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares of common stock
    of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of
    twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the Plan
    expire in June 2017.

Share-Based
    Compensation

Under the terms of the Company’s stockholder-approved
    share-based plans, incentive and non-qualified stock options and
    restricted stock awards have been, and may be, issued to the
    Company’s officers, management-level employees and members
    of its Board of Directors. Employee and non-employee director
    stock options generally vest at a rate of 25% per year,
    beginning one year from the date of the grant, and restricted
    stock awards generally have a four-year cliff vesting. Options
    primarily have a maximum contractual term of seven years. At
    December 31, 2009, 6.9 million shares of Company
    common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company’s
    share-based plans, including 4.4 million shares for stock
    options outstanding.

The Company issues previously unissued shares when options are
    exercised and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the
    award of restricted stock.

The Company measures and records compensation expense related to
    all stock awards by recognizing the grant date fair value of the
    awards over their requisite service periods in the financial
    statements. For grants under any of the Company’s plans
    that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the
    Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period for the entire award.

Expected stock volatility is based on the historical volatility

    exercise data to estimate the options’ expected life, which
    represents the period of time that the options granted are
    expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the
    future option holding periods will be similar to the historical
    option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods

Expected future pre-tax compensation expense relating to the
    2.2 million nonvested options outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009 is $13.1 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
    two years.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Company’s
    restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of the
    number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the
    Company’s common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock,
    the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation)
    at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of capital in
    excess of par value in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over
    the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived
    service period as determined on the grant date.

Restricted stock awards are subject to accelerated vesting due
    to certain events, including doubling of the grant price of the
    Company’s common stock as of the close of business during
    any five consecutive trading days. On May 19, 2008, the
    April 27, 2005 grant of 706,605 shares of restricted
    stock vested under this accelerated vesting provision. The
    pre-tax charge to income due to the accelerated vesting of these
    shares was $7.8 million ($7.3 million net after-tax
    charge) for the year ended December 31, 2008.

    granted per share during 2009 and 2008 was $32.74 and $48.38,
    respectively. Expected future pre-tax compensation expense
    related to the 0.9 million nonvested restricted shares
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009 is $17.8 million,
    which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
    period of approximately two years.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) in 2009, the Company reserved
    14,214 shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements
    and terminations were 30,036 shares in 2009. The total
    number of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was

Leases
    and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases
    in effect at December 31, 2009 (principally for production
    and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to
    $76.0 million, consisting of payments of $16.3 million
    in 2010, $11.6 million in 2011, $8.9 million in 2012,
    $6.1 million in 2013, $5.1 million in 2014 and
    $28.0 million thereafter. Rental expense was
    $22.8 million in 2009, $22.7 million in 2008 and
    $19.1 million in 2007. The leases expire over a range of
    years from 2010 to 2082, with renewal or purchase options,
    subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of
    the leases.

The Company acquired a capital lease obligation in 2007 for land
    and a building. The lease has a term of 12 years, which
    began July 2006, and is payable quarterly. Property, plant and
    equipment as of December 31, 2009 includes a building of
    $13.2 million, net of $2.3 million of accumulated
    depreciation and land of $2.1 million related to this
    capital lease. Amortization of the leased assets of
    $0.7 million is included in 2009 depreciation expense.
    Future minimum lease payments are estimated to be
    $0.9 million in each of the years 2010 through 2014 and
    $9.4 million thereafter, for total minimum lease payments
    of $13.9 million, net of interest.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had
    $161.9 million and $219.9 million, respectively, in
    purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of
    contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed
    prices.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no provision for
    U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
    its foreign subsidiaries, which total approximately
    $395 million. If the Company were to distribute those
    earnings to the United States, the Company would be subject to
    U.S. income taxes based on the excess of the
    U.S. statutory rate over statutory rates in the foreign
    jurisdiction and withholding taxes payable to the various
    foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the
    unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these
    undistributed earnings is not practicable.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had tax benefits of
    $9.3 million related to net operating loss carryforwards,
    which will be available to offset future income taxes payable,
    subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign
    and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes net operating loss
    carryforwards of



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$3.7 million for federal income tax purposes with a
    valuation allowance of $3.3 million, $3.6 million for
    state income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of
    $0.2 million, and $2.0 million for foreign locations
    with no valuation allowance. These net operating loss
    carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2010 and 2032.
    As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $3.4 million
    of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain
    deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to
    be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred
    tax assets established for net operating loss carryforwards. In
    2009, the Company recorded a decrease of $6.7 million in
    the valuation allowance primarily related to the utilization and
    expiration of net operating loss carryforwards.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized
    tax benefits of $26.5 million, of which $25.6 million
    would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had gross unrecognized tax
    benefits of $18.6 million, all of which would impact the
    effective tax rate if recognized.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to
    uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company reported
    $5.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in the
    aggregate related to interest and penalty exposure as accrued
    income tax expense in the consolidated balance sheet. During
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized $0.7 million of
    expense, $0.8 million of income and $1.5 million of
    expense, respectively, of interest and penalties in the income
    statement.

The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the
    United States. The Company files income tax returns in various
    state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple
    legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open
    tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and
    six years in these jurisdictions. In 2009, the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) completed the examination of the
    Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2005 and is
    currently examining the Company’s U.S. income tax
    returns for 2006 and 2007. In 2009, the Company concluded an
    exam in Germany for the period 2004 through 2006. The Company
    has not materially extended any other statutes of limitation for
    any significant location and has reviewed and accrued for, where
    necessary, tax liabilities for open periods. Tax years in
    certain state and foreign jurisdictions remain subject to
    examination; however the uncertain tax positions related to
    these jurisdictions are not considered material.

During 2009, the Company added $15.9 million of tax,
    interest and penalties related to 2009 activity for identified
    uncertain tax positions and reversed $4.8 million of tax
    and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of
    prior uncertain positions. During 2008, the Company added
    $11.6 million of tax, interest and penalties related to
    2008 activity for identified uncertain tax positions and
    reversed $16.5 million of tax and interest related to
    statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.

Retirement
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement
    and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
    covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
    generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of
    service

and/or

compensation. The following is a brief description of the
    Company’s retirement and pension plans.

The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
    benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
    trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
    Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined
    benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
    based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
    of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company
    estimates that it will make both required and discretionary cash
    contributions of approximately $3 million to
    $5 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans
    in 2010.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal
    year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension
    plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for
    eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the savings plan
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
    basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis up to six percent of eligible compensation or a maximum of
    $1,200 per participant.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined
    contribution retirement feature principally to cover
    U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after
    December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
    Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
    pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary
    subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the
    Company’s foreign operations participate in various local
    defined contribution plans.

The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
    certain of its U.S. acquired businesses for the benefit of
    eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
    participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed six
    percent of the participant’s base compensation.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
    Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
    supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
    arrangements

and/or

a
    SERP covering certain current and former executives of the
    Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate
    the executive for retirement benefits that would have been
    provided under the Company’s primary retirement plan,
    except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be
    taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit
    obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be
    funded by a grant of shares of the Company’s common stock
    upon retirement or termination of the executive. The Company is
    providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the
    applicable periods.

The expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was
    8.25% in 2009 and 2008. Equity securities included
    679,200 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market
    value of $26.0 million (6.0% of total plan investment
    assets) at December 31, 2009 and 679,200 shares of
    AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of
    $20.5 million (5.8% of total plan investment assets) at
    December 31, 2008.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the plans’
    funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
    expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
    term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
    established. Since there may be periods of time where both
    equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an
    allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
    overall portfolio’s diversification and return potential.
    The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking
    into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
    streams and the

investment strategy of the pension plans. The actual asset
    allocation is monitored frequently relative to the established
    targets and ranges and is rebalanced when necessary.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
    style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
    component.

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets
    is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
    assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
    portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
    guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
    interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in
    the footnote to the table above, certain investments are
    prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital,
    private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin
    trading, commodities, short selling and rights and warrants.
    Foreign currency futures, options and forward contracts may be
    used to manage foreign currency exposure.

For the Company’s foreign defined benefit pension plans,
    the asset allocation percentages at December 31, 2009 and
    2008 and the target allocation percentages for 2010, by asset
    category, are as follows:

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
    rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
    level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
    of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
    different asset classes, relative to the plans’ liabilities
    and how this can be affected by diversification, and the
    relative returns available on equities, fixed-income
    investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility
    of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are
    considered. It is expected that equities will outperform
    fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the
    trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may
    better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
    relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and
    the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to
    adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward
    equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be
    reviewed, from time to time, in view of changes in market
    conditions and in the plans’ liability profile.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
    developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
    the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
    assets. This review also considered current capital market
    conditions and expectations of projected future investment
    returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
    category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
    The current low interest rate environment also influences this
    outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for
    U.S. plans remains at 8.25% and foreign plans are slightly
    lower at 6.97% for 2010.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
    and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected
    benefit obligation in excess of plan assets and pension plans
    with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets

Postretirement
    Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
    pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former
    employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and
    are not significant.

The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
    certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
    retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
    employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
    retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
    compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
    invested in either, or a combination of, (a) an
    interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
    the general assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of
    a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common
    stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
    plan, including income earned, was $16.1 million and
    $13.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by

Reportable
    Segments and Geographic Areas Information

Descriptive
    Information about Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, EIG and EMG. The
    Company manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments
    for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
    type, production processes, distribution methods and management
    organizations.

EIG produces instrumentation for various electronic applications
    used in transportation industries, including aircraft cockpit
    instruments and displays, airborne electronics systems that
    monitor and record flight and engine data, and pressure,
    temperature, flow and liquid-level sensors for commercial
    airlines and aircraft and jet engine manufacturers. EIG also
    produces analytical instrumentation for the laboratory and
    research markets, as well as instruments for food service
    equipment, measurement and monitoring instrumentation for
    various process industries and instruments and complete
    instrument panels for heavy trucks, heavy construction and
    agricultural vehicles. EIG also manufactures ultraprecise
    measurement instrumentation, as well as thermoplastic compounds
    for automotive, appliance and telecommunications applications.

EMG produces brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass
    transit, medical equipment, computer and business machine
    applications. EMG also produces high-purity metal powders and
    alloys in powder, strip and wire form for electronic components,
    aircraft and automotive products, as well as heat exchangers and
    thermal management subsystems. EMG also supplies hermetically
    sealed (moisture-proof) connectors, terminals and headers. These
    electromechanical devices are used in aerospace, defense and
    other industrial applications. Additionally, EMG produces
    air-moving electric motors and motor-blower systems for
    manufacturers of floor care appliances and outdoor power
    equipment. Sales of floor care and specialty motors represented
    10.8% in 2009, 12.1% in 2008 and 13.7% in 2007 of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales.

Measurement
    of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
    and expenses (including certain administrative and other
    expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include an
    allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
    reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and
    profits, which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are
    generally based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment
    assets include allocations directly related to the
    segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of
    investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits and deferred
    taxes.

Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
    basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
    of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
    business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
    parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
    enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. The
    amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
    the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
    point in time. At December 31, 2009, the maximum amount of
    future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees
    was $50.4 million and the outstanding liability under
    certain of those guarantees was $4.9 million. These
    guarantees expire in 2010.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
    transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
    compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
    unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified
    events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or retention of
    previously existing environmental, tax or



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

employee liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often
    are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation
    for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because
    the amount of these types of indemnifications generally is not
    specifically stated, the overall maximum amount of the
    obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably
    estimated. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and
    officers for claims against them in connection with their
    positions with the Company. Historically, any such costs
    incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have
    been minimal for the Company. The Company believes that future
    payments, if any, under all existing indemnification agreements
    would not have a material impact on its consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

Product
    Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
    sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
    vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the
    most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
    warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and
    adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
    expenses.

Changes in accrued product warranty obligation were as follows
    at December 31:

Contingencies

Asbestos
    Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a
    defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of
    asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate
    to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not
    involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company
    or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which
    are under new ownership. In connection with many of these
    lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the
    case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these
    claims (the “Indemnified Claims”). The Indemnified
    Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such
    sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met
    their obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not
    have any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill
    their obligations in the future; however, one of these companies
    filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007. To date, no judgments
    have been rendered against the Company as a result of any
    asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong
    defenses to the claims being asserted and intends to continue to
    vigorously defend itself in these matters.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
    existing at that time, at December 31, 2009, the Company is
    named a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) at 16

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

is identified as a “de minimis” party in 14 of these
    sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company
    relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten
    of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on
    the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation
    and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to
    settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites,
    the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the
    alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the
    parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites
    to establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the two
    remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the
    Company is participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
    issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
    this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites,
    the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
    probable remediation activities at certain of its current or
    previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned”
    sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with
    respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established
    once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
    estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through
    the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
    feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
    instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for
    such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
    the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of
    remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current
    estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial
    statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not
    expected to result in a material change to the consolidated
    financial statements. In estimating the Company’s liability
    for remediation, the Company also considers the likely
    proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and
    the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2009 and 2008
    were $27.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively,
    for non-owned and owned sites. In 2009, the Company received
    $1.3 million of additional reserves from a third party for
    existing sites. Additionally, the Company spent
    $2.7 million on environmental matters in 2009. The
    Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 include reserves of
    $19.2 million and $17.9 million, respectively, for an
    owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005
    acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is
    the designated performing party for the performance of remedial
    activities for one of several operating units making up a large
    Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The
    Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial
    assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of
    the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had $13.9 million in receivables related to HCC for
    probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other
    committed third-party funds to support the required remediation.
    Also, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for
    approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain
    of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously
    owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or
    new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
    Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
    under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other
    parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental
    matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in
    all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for
    bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, as discussed further in the
    following paragraph.

In August 2009, the Company agreed to a Stipulation and
    Settlement Agreement with the San Diego Regional Water
    Quality Control Board regarding the 2008 Notice of
    Administrative Civil Liability related to a former subsidiary
    which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy
    liquidation in 2007, whereby the Company paid and deferred minor
    penalties, which were covered by previously established reserves.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are
    sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing
    claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe
    that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations
    in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon
    presently available information and past experience related to
    such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been
    made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not
    expected to materially affect the consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and
    procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that

    principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
    of our system of disclosure controls and procedures as required

    Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer have concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.

Such evaluation did not identify any change in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the year ended December 31, 2009 that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
