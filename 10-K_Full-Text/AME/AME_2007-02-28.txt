Competition is increasing from Asian motor manufacturers that serve both the U.S. and the European
floor care markets. Increasingly, global vacuum motor production is being shifted to Asia where
AMETEK has a growing but smaller market position. There is potential competition from vertically
integrated manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own motor-blowers. Many of these
manufacturers would also be potential EMG customers if they decided to outsource their motor
production.

BACKLOG AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF BUSINESS

The Company’s approximate backlog of unfilled orders by business segment at the dates
specified below was as follows:

340.9

The higher backlog at December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the five businesses acquired in
2006, as well as increased order rates, primarily in the Company’s differentiated businesses.

Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2006, approximately 86% is expected to
be shipped by December 31, 2007. The Company believes that neither its business as a whole, nor
either of its reportable segments, is subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain
individual operations experience some seasonal variability.

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS

The Company’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources,
and generally from more than one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various base
metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers. The
Company believes its sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs.

RESEARCH, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING

The Company is committed to research, product development, and engineering activities that are
designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products.
Research, product development, and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $87.6
million, $75.9 million and $66.0 million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Customer
reimbursements in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $6.4 million, $8.9 million and $6.2 million,
respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $42.0
million, $34.8 million and $25.5 million, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward
the development of new products and processes, and the improvement of existing products and
processes.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth on pages 29-30 of this report
in the section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations entitled “Environmental Matters”.



PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS

The Company owns numerous unexpired U.S. patents and foreign patents, including counterparts
of its more important U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the world. The Company is
a licensor or licensee under patent agreements of various types, and its products are marketed
under various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign trademarks and trade names. However,
the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark, or any group thereof, essential
either to its business as a whole or to either of its business segments. The annual royalties
received or paid under license agreements are not significant to either of its reportable segments
or to the Company’s overall operations.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2006, the Company employed approximately 10,400 people in its EMG, EIG and
corporate operations, of whom approximately 3,000 employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements. The Company has two collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2007, which
cover less than 200 employees. The Company expects no material adverse effects from the pending
labor contract negotiations.

WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital requirements in either of its
reportable segments. Customers generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include
extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled and maintained at levels related
to production cycles, and are responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future
acquisitions, successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions or finance future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. Since
the beginning of 2003, we have completed thirteen acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic
acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we
have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfully
effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in
unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from
management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our
existing operations. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful
integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.



We may experience unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities
or product line transfers.

Certain of our businesses are relocating, or have recently relocated manufacturing operations
to low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new
facilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of our
existing facilities, could result in product inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our
business and operations.

Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with
international operations.

International sales for 2006 and 2005 represented approximately 48% and 46% of our total net
sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of
sales outside the United States will continue to increase in the future. International operations
are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:

If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business
and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop on a timely
basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.
Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors,
maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and
sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such
investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such
competitive advantages, or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not
currently aware of any emerging standards or new products, which could render our existing products
obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to
develop and successfully market new products.

A shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs.

We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material requirements and we are not
dependent on any one supplier; however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel
components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity
market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the
prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect
our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic
substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and
foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among
other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling,
storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are
inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous
owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and
remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether



the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous
materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on
parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have
been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of
government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that
use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur
substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to
compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential
financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that
the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new
classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the
discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could
require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can
be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages
due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.

We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant
costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and
regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new
laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us. We cannot predict the impact any
of these will have on our business or operations.

We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm
caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that
the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example,
our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the
failure of, for example, an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by
us. We may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful.
While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to
protect us from future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims
that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at
an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party
indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations
or ability to expand our business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with
individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have
resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are price,
product technology, distribution, quality and service. EMG’s competition in specialty metal
products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we
believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the pressure gauge,
aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the
basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new, or improve
existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies
or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be
adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our
products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.

A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motor
businesses could adversely affect our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are
affected by factors beyond our control. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our
ability to incur additional indebtedness.

Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive
covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could
limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility.



Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and
write-off of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31,
2006, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1,081 million, or about 51% of
our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost
over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have
acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of
our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were
to fall significantly below current levels, we could reflect, under current applicable accounting
rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment.
Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or other
intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company has 71 operating plant facilities in 19 states and 10 foreign countries. Of these
facilities, 48 are owned by the Company and 23 are leased. The properties owned by the Company
consist of approximately 664 acres, of which approximately 5.9 million square feet are under roof.
Under lease is a total of approximately 994,000 square feet. The leases expire over a range of
years from 2007 to 2040, with renewal options for varying terms contained in most of the leases.
Production facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and South Korea provide the Company with additional
production capacity through the Company’s investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures. The
Company’s executive offices in Paoli, PA, occupy approximately 34,000 square feet under a lease
that expires in 2007.

The Company’s machinery and equipment, plants, and offices are in satisfactory operating
condition and are adequate for the uses to which they are put. The operating facilities of the
Company by business segment are summarized in the following table:

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company and/or its subsidiaries have been named as defendants, along with many other
companies, in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. To date, no judgments have been entered
against the Company. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the claims, and intends to
continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Other companies are also indemnifying the
Company against certain of these claims. (Also see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company’s security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006.

EBITDA represents income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA
is presented because the Company is aware that it is used by rating agencies, securities analysts,
investors and other parties in evaluating the Company. It should not be considered, however, as an
alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, or as an
alternative to cash flows as a measure of the Company’s overall liquidity as presented in the
Company’s financial statements. Furthermore, EBITDA measures shown for the Company may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below presents the
reconciliation of net income reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to EBITDA.

operations.

Business Overview

As a multinational business, AMETEK’s operations are affected by global, regional and industry
economic factors. However, the Company’s strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its
mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable
developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating
results. In 2006, the Company experienced improved market conditions in most of its businesses.
Strong internal growth and the contribution from recent acquisitions, combined with successful
Operational Excellence initiatives, enabled the Company to post another year of record sales,
operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, and cash flow from operating activities
in 2006. In addition to achieving its financial objectives, the Company also continued to make
progress on its strategic initiatives under AMETEK’s four growth strategies: Operational
Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion, and Strategic Acquisitions and
Alliances. Highlights of 2006 were:

•

Sales were $1.8 billion, an increase of $384.8 million or 26.8% from 2005 on solid
internal growth of 9% in each of the Company’s reportable segments, the Electronic
Instruments Group (EIG) and the Electromechanical Group (EMG), and contributions from the
following acquisitions completed during the year:

•

In October 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of its
common stock, paid on November 27, 2006 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2006.
Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash
dividend rate on the Company’s common stock to $0.06 per common share from $0.04 per
common share on a post-split basis.



•

As the Company grows globally, it continues to achieve an increasing level of
international sales.  International sales, including U.S. export sales,
represented 47.6% of consolidated sales in 2006, compared with 45.7% of sales in 2005.

•

The Company’s Operational Excellence strategy is directed toward lowering its overall
cost structure, and includes the ongoing transition of a portion of its motor and
instrument production to low-cost manufacturing facilities in Mexico, China and the Czech
Republic. This strategy had a positive impact on our operating results in 2006 and
contributed to improved segment operating margins which were 18.9% of sales in 2006, up
from 18.4% of sales in 2005.

•

Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow from operating activities that totaled
$226.0 million, a $70.3 million or 45.2% increase from 2005. At year-end 2006, our
debt-to-capital ratio was 41.4%, compared with 43.8% at the end of 2005.

•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and
engineering, spending $87.6 million in 2006 before customer reimbursement of $6.4 million,
an increase of 15.4% over 2005. Sales from products introduced in the last three years
increased $137.0 million or 59.6% in 2006 over 2005 to $366.9 million.

2004, respectively. (See Note 9).



Year Ended December 31, 2006, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005

Results of Operations

In 2006, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per
share and cash flow from operations. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth
in both its EIG and EMG Groups, as well as contributions from acquisitions in 2006 and 2005.
Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost reduction
programs under our Operational Excellence initiatives. Based on current market conditions, the
Company expects continued strength in most of its businesses in 2007.

The Company reported sales for 2006 of $1,819.3 million, an increase of $384.8 million or
26.8% from sales of $1,434.5 million in 2005. Net sales for EIG were $1,016.5 million in 2006, an
increase of 25.7% from sales of $808.5 million in 2005. EIG’s internal sales growth was 9% in 2006,
driven by strength in its process, aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of SPECTRO in
June 2005, Solartron in September 2005, Pulsar in February 2006 and Land Instruments in June 2006
also contributed to the sales growth. Net sales for EMG were $802.8 million in 2006, an increase of
28.2% from sales of $626.0 million in 2005. EMG’s internal sales growth was also 9% in 2006 driven
by the Group’s differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of HCC in October 2005 and Pittman in
May 2006 also contributed to the sales growth.

Total international sales for 2006 increased to $866.0 million and represented 47.6% of
consolidated sales, an increase of $210.1 million, or 32.0% when compared with international sales
of $655.9 million or 45.7% of consolidated sales in 2005. The increase in international sales
resulted from the recent acquisitions of SPECTRO, Solartron and HCC in 2005 and the Land
Instruments acquisition in 2006, as well as increased international sales from base businesses.
Increased international sales came mainly from sales to Asia and
Europe by both Group’s. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international
sales, were $343.8 million in 2006, an increase of $76.5 million or 28.6% compared with $267.3
million in 2005. Export shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from base
businesses.

New orders for 2006 were $1,915.4 million, compared with $1,534.3 million for 2005, an
increase of $381.1 million or 24.8%. The increase in orders was driven by demand in the Company’s
differentiated businesses, led by the Company’s process businesses as well as the recent
acquisitions mentioned above. The order backlog at December 31, 2006 was $536.8 million, compared
with $440.7 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of $96.1 million or 21.8%. The increase in
backlog was due to higher order levels in base differentiated businesses as well as the 2006
acquisitions.

Segment operating income was $343.4 million for 2006, an increase of $79.9 million, or 30.3%,
compared with segment operating income of $263.5 million for 2005. Segment operating margins in
2006 were 18.9% of sales, an increase from 18.4% of sales in 2005. The increase in segment
operating income resulted from strength in the differentiated businesses of each group, which
includes the profit contributions made by the acquisitions. The margin improvement came from the
Company’s differentiated businesses.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $219.5 million in 2006, compared
with $174.2 million in 2005, an increase of $45.2 million or 26.0%. However, as a percentage of
sales, SG&A expenses in 2006 were flat with 2005 at 12.1% of sales. Selling expenses, as a
percentage of sales, were 10.2% in 2006, essentially unchanged from 2005. Most of the increase in
selling expenses was due to the acquired businesses. The Company’s acquisition strategy generally
is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher
marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses
increased 4.9% which is significantly lower than the Company’s 9% internal sales growth rate for
2006.

Corporate administrative expenses were $34.2 million in 2006, an increase of $4.5 million or
15.3%, when compared with 2005. The increase in corporate expenses is the result of higher
compensation costs, including equity-based compensation. As a percentage of sales, corporate
administrative expenses were 1.9% in 2006, a decline from 2.1% of sales in 2005.

Consolidated operating income was $309.0 million in 2006, an increase of $75.5 million or
32.3% when compared with $233.5 million in 2005. This represents an operating margin of 17.0% of
sales for 2006 compared with 16.3% of sales in 2005.



Interest expense was $42.2 million in 2006, an increase of 28.1% compared with $32.9 million
in 2005. The increase was due to higher average borrowings necessary to fund the 2005 and 2006
acquisitions, primarily related to the euro long-term debt incurred for the 2005 acquisition of
SPECTRO and short-term debt incurred for the late 2005 acquisition of HCC.

The effective tax rate for 2006 was 31.0% compared with 31.2% in 2005. The 2006
effective tax rate benefited primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign tax
credit carryforwards of $3.2 million, offset somewhat by higher nondeductible equity-based
compensation. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates benefited from the realization of tax benefits
stemming from the Company’s worldwide tax planning activities and other adjustments.

Net income for 2006 was $181.9 million, an increase of $45.5 million, or 33.4% from $136.4
million in 2005. Diluted earnings per share increased 32.6% to $1.71 per share, an increase of
$0.42 when compared with $1.29 per diluted share in 2005.

Operating Segment Results

EIG’s

sales were $1,016.5 million in 2006, an increase of $208.0 million or 25.7% from 2005
sales of $808.5 million. The sales increase was due to internal growth in EIG’s process, aerospace
and power businesses, and the acquisitions of SPECTRO and Solartron in 2005 and Pulsar and Land
Instruments in 2006. Included in the 25.7% increase in sales is internal growth of approximately
9%. The acquisitions accounted for the remainder of the sales increase. The foreign currency
translation effect on sales for 2006 was nominal.

EIG’s operating income for 2006 increased to $203.4 million from $164.2 million in 2005, an
increase of $39.2 million, or 23.9%. The increase in operating income was driven by the higher
sales, which includes the acquisitions. Operating margins of EIG were 20.0% of sales for 2006
compared with operating margins of 20.3% of sales in 2005. The decrease in operating margins was
due to the inclusion of a $4.3 million gain from the sale of a facility in 2005.

EMG’s

sales for 2006 were $802.8 million, an increase of $176.8 million or 28.2%, compared
with sales of $626.0 million in 2005. The sales increase was due in part to internal growth,
particularly in EMG’s differentiated businesses, which accounted for approximately 9% of the 28.2%
sales increase. The acquisitions of HCC in October 2005 and Pittman in May 2006 accounted for the
remainder of the sales increase. The foreign currency translation effect on sales for 2006 was
nominal.

EMG’s operating income for 2006 increased to $139.9 million from $99.2 million in 2005, an
increase of $40.7 million or 41.0%. The operating income increase was significantly due to higher
sales from the Group’s differentiated businesses, which includes the recent acquisitions mentioned
above. EMG’s operating margins were 17.4% of sales in 2006 compared with operating margins of
15.9% of sales in 2005. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to a higher profit yield
on the sales contribution of EMG’s differentiated businesses.

Year Ended December 31, 2005, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004

Results of Operations

In 2005, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings
per share. The Company achieved these results from acquisitions, internal growth in both its EIG
and EMG groups, and cost reduction programs. The Company experienced improved market conditions in
most of its differentiated businesses in 2005.

The Company reported sales for 2005 of $1,434.5 million, an increase of $202.1 million or
16.4% from sales of $1,232.3 million in 2004. Net sales for EIG were $808.5 million in 2005, an
increase of 21.1% from sales of $667.4 million in 2004. EIG’s internal sales growth was 4.6% in
2005, driven by strength in its high-end analytical instruments business, the heavy-vehicle
instruments business, and the aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of SPECTRO in June
2005, Solartron in September 2005, and Taylor Hobson in June 2004 also contributed to the sales
growth. Net sales for EMG were $626.0 million in 2005, an increase of 10.8% from sales of $564.9
million in 2004. EMG’s internal sales growth was 4.2% in 2005 driven by the Group’s differentiated
businesses, partially offset by weak market conditions within the Group’s cost-driven businesses.
The acquisitions of HCC in October 2005 and Hughes-Treitler in July 2004 also contributed to the
sales increase.



Total international sales for 2005 increased to $655.9 million and represented 45.7% of
consolidated sales, an increase of $119.3 million, or 22.2% when compared with international sales
of $536.6 million or 43.5% of consolidated sales in 2004. The increase in international sales
resulted from the acquisitions previously mentioned as well as increased international sales from
base businesses. Increased international sales came mainly from sales to Europe and Asia by both
operating groups. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total
international sales, were $267.3 million in 2005, an increase of 15.2% compared with $232.0 million
in 2004.

New orders for 2005 were $1,534.3 million, compared with $1,287.0 million for 2004, an
increase of $247.3 million or 19.2%. Most of the increase in orders was driven by demand in the
Company’s differentiated businesses, led by the Company’s aerospace and process businesses as well
as the 2005 acquisitions mentioned above. The order backlog at December 31, 2005 was $440.7
million, compared with $340.9 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of $99.8 million or 29.3%.
The increase in backlog was due mainly to the 2005 acquisitions. Backlog increases were also
reported by many of the Company’s base differentiated businesses.

Segment operating income was $263.5 million for 2005, an increase of $45.6 million, or 20.9%,
compared with segment operating income of $217.9 million for 2004. Segment operating margins in
2005 were 18.4% of sales, an increase from 17.7% of sales in 2004. The increase in segment
operating income was due to higher sales from the Company’s differentiated businesses.
Approximately half of the increase in operating income was from the 2005 acquisitions. The margin
improvement came entirely from the Company’s base differentiated businesses.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)
expenses were $174.2 million in 2005, compared
with $137.8 million in 2004, an increase of $36.4 million
or 26.4%. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
expenses were 12.1% in 2005, compared with 11.2% in 2004. Selling expenses, as a percentage of
sales, increased to 10.1% in 2005, compared with 9.1% in 2004. The selling expense increase and the
corresponding increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due primarily to business
acquisitions. The Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated
businesses, which, because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs, tend to have
a higher rate of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased 5.0%, which
approximates internal sales growth for 2005.

Corporate administrative expenses were $30.0 million in 2005, an increase of $3.3 million or
12.4%, when compared with 2004. The increase in corporate expenses is the result of higher
restricted stock amortization expense related to the Company’s change in its long-term incentive
compensation program and higher personnel costs necessary to grow the Company. As a percentage of
sales, corporate administrative expenses were 2.1% in 2005, which was slightly lower than 2004.

Consolidated operating income was $233.5 million in 2005, an increase of $42.3 million or
22.1% when compared with $191.2 million in 2004. This represented an operating margin of 16.3% of
sales for 2005 compared with 15.5% of sales in 2004.

Interest expense was $32.9 million in 2005, an increase of 16.1% compared with $28.3 million
in 2004. The increase was due to higher average borrowing levels due to the 2005 acquisitions, and
higher average interest rates.

The effective tax rate for 2005 was 31.2% compared with 32.2% in 2004. The reduction in
the effective tax rate was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits stemming from the
Company’s worldwide tax planning activities, and other adjustments.

Net income for 2005 was $136.4 million, an increase of $27.4 million, or 25.1%, from $109.0
million in 2004. Diluted earnings per share rose 21.7% to $1.29 per share, an increase of $0.23,
when compared with $1.06 per diluted share in 2004.

Operating Segment Results

EIG’s

sales were $808.5 million in 2005, an increase of
$141.1 million or 21.1% from 2004 sales of
$667.4 million. The sales increase was due to internal growth in EIG’s aerospace, process and
analytical instruments, and industrial markets and the acquisitions
of Taylor Hobson in 2004, and
SPECTRO and Solartron in 2005. Internal growth accounted for 4.6% of the 21.1% increase. The
acquisitions accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.



EIG’s operating income for 2005 increased to $164.2 million from $124.6 million in 2004, an
increase of $39.6 million, or 31.8%. The increase in operating income was due to higher sales.
Approximately half of the increase in operating income was from the 2005 acquisitions mentioned
above. Both years included nonrecurring pretax gains; 2005 included a gain of $4.3 million from
the sale of a facility, and 2004 included a gain of $5.3 million from settlement of an insurance
claim. Operating margins of EIG improved to 20.3% of sales for 2005 compared with operating margins
of 18.7% of sales in 2004 due to production efficiencies in the Company’s base businesses.

EMG’s

sales for 2005 were $626.0 million, an increase of $61.1 million or 10.8%, compared with
sales of $564.9 million in 2004. The sales increase was due in part to internal growth,
particularly in the Group’s differentiated businesses, which accounted for 4.2% of the 10.8% sales
increase. The acquisitions of Hughes-Treitler in 2004 and HCC in October 2005 as well as $2.3
million of favorable foreign currency translation effects accounted for the remainder of the sales
increase.

EMG’s operating income for 2005 increased to $99.2 million from $93.3 million in 2004, an
increase of $5.9 million or 6.3%. EMG’s increase in operating income was primarily due to higher
sales from its differentiated businesses, which included the 2005 acquisitions mentioned above.
Operating margins of EMG were 15.9% of sales in 2005 compared with operating margins of 16.5% of
sales in 2004. The decrease in operating margin was the result of unfavorable changes in product
mix within the Group’s cost-driven motor businesses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $226.0 million for 2006, compared with $155.7
million in 2005, an increase of $70.3 million, or 45.2%. The increase in operating cash flow was
primarily the result of higher earnings and lower overall operating working capital requirements.
In 2006, the Company contributed $13.7 million to its defined benefit pension plans compared to
$11.3 million contributed in 2005. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital spending) was
$196.8 million in 2006, compared to $132.4 million  in 2005. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization) was $351.4 million in 2006, compared with $269.9 million in 2005, a
30.2% improvement. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they
are measures that are used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See table on page 18 for a
reconciliation of generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).

Cash used for investing activities was $206.0 million for 2006, compared with $361.8 million
in 2005. In 2006, the Company paid $177.6 million for five businesses and two small technology
lines, net of cash received. In 2005, the Company paid $340.7 million for three acquisitions and
two small technology lines, net of cash received. Additions to property, plant and equipment
totaled $29.2 million in 2006, compared with $23.3 million in 2005.

Cash used for financing activities totaled $10.0 million in 2006, compared with cash provided
of $207.0 million in 2005. In 2006, total borrowings, net of repayments, increased by $15.4
million, compared with a net increase of $197.5 million in 2005. The net increase in long-term
borrowings was $11.3 million in 2006 compared with a net increase of $91.8 million in 2005.
Short-term borrowings increased $4.0 million in 2006, compared with an increase of $105.7 million
in 2005. At December 31, 2006 the Company had available borrowing capacity of $276.1 million under
its $400 million revolving bank credit facility, which includes an accordion feature allowing $100
million of additional borrowing capacity, and had fully utilized its $75.0 million accounts
receivable securitization facility. The accounts receivable securitization facility was amended in
October 2006 only to extend its expiration date from December 2006 to March 2007. The revolving
bank credit facility was also amended in October 2006 to extend its expiration date from June 2010 to
October 2011. This amendment also lowers the Company’s cost of capital and provides the Company
with increased financing flexibility to support its growth plans. The Company’s debt agreements
contain various covenants including limitations on indebtedness and dividend payments, and
maintenance of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was in
compliance with the debt covenants.

At December 31, 2006, total debt outstanding was $681.9 million compared with $631.4 million
at December 31, 2005. The debt-to-capital ratio was 41.4% at December 31, 2006, compared with 43.8%
at December 31, 2005.

In 2006, net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options were $9.9 million,
compared with $16.2 million in 2005. Cash dividends paid were $18.8 million in 2006
and $16.8 million in 2005. In October 2006, the Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the
quarterly cash dividend rate on the Company’s common stock to $0.06 per common share from $0.04 per
common share on a post stock split basis.



In 2006, the Company used cash of $21.1 million for the repurchase of 750,000 shares of
its common stock to offset the dilutive effect of shares granted under the Company’s stock
incentive plans. There were no repurchases of the Company’s common stock in 2005. As of December
31, 2006, $31.4 million was available, under the current Board authorization, for future share
repurchases.

The following table summarizes AMETEK’s contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2006, and
the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flows in
future years.

(a)

Although not contractually obligated, the Company expects to have the capability to repay the
U.S. portion of this obligation within one year as permitted in the credit agreement.
Accordingly, $80.3 million is classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2006. The foreign
portion of the obligation is related to a foreign acquisition and creates a natural hedging
instrument to offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the net investment in the acquired
business due to changes in the British pound. Accordingly, $16.4 million is classified as
long-term debt at December 31, 2006.

(b)

Amount includes $75 million under the accounts receivable securitization program,
which is classified as short-term borrowings at December 31, 2006.

(c)

Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain
inventories at fixed prices.

Other Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of approximately $27.9 million
related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2006. Based on experience with these
arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its
financial position.

Although it has not done so in recent years, the Company may, from time to time, redeem,
tender for, or repurchase its long-term debt in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions depending upon availability, market conditions and other factors.

As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in 2006, cash and cash equivalents at
December 31, 2006 totaled $49.1 million, compared with $35.5 million at December 31, 2005. The
Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted
foreign sources, and available financing alternatives, to enable it to meet operating needs and
contractual commitments.



Transactions with Related Parties

A member of the Company’s Board of Directors is of counsel to the law firm of Stroock &
Stroock & Lavan LLP, with which the Company has a business relationship. In 2006, Stroock & Stroock
& Lavan LLP billed fees to the Company in the aggregate for services rendered, primarily services
related to a business acquisition, of $706,000. An immediate family member of AMETEK’s Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer and an immediate family member of a member of AMETEK’s Board of
Directors are employed at operating units of the Company and each has an annual salary in excess of
$120,000.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that
can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results
of operations, and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past
experience and management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual
results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and
related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Company’s accounting policies and to
management’s discussion and analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific
disclosures about the Company’s accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective
decisions, or assessments whereby materially different results of operations and financial
condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions
existed. Primary disclosure of the Company’s significant accounting policies is in Note 1 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included elsewhere in this report.

•

Revenue Recognition

.

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to
the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and
risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is
fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss
passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer,
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect
to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return
products or be given allowances, except at the Company’s option. We have agreements
with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products.
The distributor purchases the product from the Company at which time title and risk of
loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company
accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized
in the statement of income. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances, and estimated
warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. At
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $10.9
million, $9.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively. The Company’s expense for
warranty obligations approximated $7.6 million, $7.2 million and $5.0 million in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among
the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company
calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience, and
adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future
sales returns, allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience,
additional accruals may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the
Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these
customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based
on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical
experience. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $7.4 million and $7.6 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting,
which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 55% of its inventories.
The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the
remaining 45% of its inventory. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO
method, the excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO value would have been approximately
$34.1 million and $28.4 million higher than the amount reported in the balance sheet at



December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory
reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about
future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial
difficulties, and related management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets.

The Company accounts for goodwill and other
intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Under SFAS 142, purchased goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not
amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually

.

These impairment
tests require the projection and discounting of cash flows, estimates of future
operating performance of the reporting unit being valued and estimates of the fair
value of the intangible assets being tested. SFAS 142 requires a two-step impairment
test for goodwill. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds
the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is
recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be
completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset
and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the
amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be
required to record such impairment losses. Changes in interest rates and market
conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. These estimates
will likely change over time. The Company’s acquisitions have generally included a
large goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make
acquisitions. At December 31, 2006, goodwill and other
intangible assets totaled approximately $1,081.2 million, or
50.7% of the Company's total assets.
The Company performed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter
of 2006 and determined that the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles
were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived
intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.

•

Pensions.

The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
AMETEK accounts for all of its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

, and effective December 31, 2006, SFAS 158,

Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

SFAS 158
requires balance sheet recognition of
the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans. SFAS
87 and SFAS 158 require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined
on an actuarial basis. The most significant elements in determining the Company’s pension
income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return
on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the
pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the
Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In
estimating this rate for 2006, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality,
fixed-income investments. The discount rate used in determining the 2006 pension cost was
5.65% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 5.00% for foreign plans. The discount
rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2006, and
determining the 2007 defined benefit pension cost is 5.90% for U.S. plans and 5.00% for
foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. discount rate, the Company’s actuaries developed a
customized discount rate appropriate to the Plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on
yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The
Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2006 of 8.25% for
U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 7.00% for foreign plans. We will continue to use
these rates for 2007 for U.S. and foreign plans, respectively. The Company determines the
expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns
for the pension plans’ investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical
returns on comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments, and adjusts its
estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining
the 2006 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 3.5% and will be 3.75% in 2007. For
foreign plans, the rate of compensation increase will be increased from 3.4% in 2006 to
3.61% in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recognized consolidated pretax pension
expense of $2.5 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans,
including $0.8 million for pension curtailments. This compares with pretax pension
expense of $2.1 million recognized for these plans in 2005.



As discussed above, effective December 31, 2006, we have adopted the balance sheet
recognition requirements of SFAS 158. Under SFAS 158 all unrecognized prior service
costs, remaining transition obligations or assets, and actuarial gains and losses have
been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a
component of net periodic pension cost. In addition, effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, the measurement date, (the date at which plan assets
and benefit obligation are measured) is required to be the Company’s fiscal year-end.
Presently we use a December 31 measurement date for all of our U.S. defined benefit
plans, and an October 1 measurement date for our foreign plans. However, we plan to
early adopt the measurement date provision of SFAS 158 for our foreign plans in 2007.
The effect of adopting SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006 resulted in a decrease in total
assets of $43.1 million, a decrease in total liabilities of $10.4 million, and a reduction
of total stockholders’ equity of $32.7 million, net of tax. The adoption of SFAS
158 did not affect our operations.

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension
plans during 2006 which totaled $13.7 million, compared with
$11.3 million in 2005. The
Company anticipates making cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in
2007.

•

Income Taxes.

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the related balance sheet
accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes
and utilize estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the world,
subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions,
resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which
is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and
determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome
differs, future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities may be
necessary. We also are required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, taking into
consideration our forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss
carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize
the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, we must evaluate the need for, and
amount of, valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and
circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be
required.

Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS 158, which requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of
financial position at year-end and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which
the changes occur through AOCI in stockholders’ equity. SFAS 158
was effective for the Company as
of December 31, 2006. The effect of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a decrease in total assets of
$43.1 million, a decrease in total liabilities of $10.4 million, and a reduction of total
stockholders’ equity of $32.7 million, net of tax, as a
charge  to AOCI. (See Note 12).

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit
fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 will have
an effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax
positions, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on



derecognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the Company
will adopt  FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will
be recorded in retained earnings. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact of
adopting FIN 48.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, using the
modified retrospective method. SFAS 123R requires the Company to expense the fair value of equity
awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is now recognized in the financial statements
over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 9.

In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 06-5,

Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance — Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in
Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-4

(EITF 06-5). EITF 06-5 provides guidance in
determining the amount to be realized under certain insurance contracts and the related
disclosures. EITF 06-5 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2006 and
should be adopted as a change in accounting principle, as a cumulative-effect adjustment to
retained earnings or as a retrospective adjustment to all prior periods. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adoption of EITF 06-5 on our financial statements.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”), which documents the SEC staff’s views regarding the process of
quantifying financial statement misstatements. Under SAB 108, an evaluation of the materiality of
an identified unadjusted error must consider the impact of both the current-year error and the
cumulative error, if applicable. This also means that both the impact on the current-period income
statement and the period-end balance sheet must be considered. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal
years ending after November 15, 2006. Any cumulative adjustments required to be recorded as a
result of adopting SAB 108 would be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings. Adoption of SAB 108 did not have an effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Internal Reinvestment

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $29.2 million, or 1.6% of sales in 2006, compared with $23.3
million, or 1.6% of sales in 2005. Approximately 53% of the expenditures in 2006 were for the
maintenance of, or additional, equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The
Company’s 2006 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve
productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. For 2007, capital expenditures are expected
to approximate $40 million, with a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and
expand production capacity of its low-cost manufacturing facilities. The 2007 capital expenditures
are expected to approximate 2% of sales.

Product Development and Engineering

Product development and engineering expenses are directed toward the development and
improvement of new and existing products and processes. Such expenses before customer reimbursement
were $87.6 million in 2006, an increase from $75.9 million in 2005, and $66.0 million in 2004.
Customer reimbursements were $6.4 million, $8.9 million, and $6.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Included in the amounts above are net expenses for research and development of $42.0
million for 2006, $34.8 million for 2005, and $25.5 million for 2004.

Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally
hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these waste
products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time, at December 31, 2006
the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 16 non-AMETEK-owned former waste
disposal or treatment sites. The Company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these
sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed
to other named PRPs. In 11 of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the
cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements.
The agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other two sites, the Company is
continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated
by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate
settlement



amount. In the three remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP,
the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a
PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s expected
obligation. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels
and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-AMETEK-owned former
waste disposal or treatment sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
probable remediation activities at
certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations. For claims and
proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are
established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate
is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed
a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low-end of the range.
It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary
from the current estimates, and the amounts accrued in the financial
statements; however, the
amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the financial
statements. In estimating our liability for remediation, we also consider our likely proportionate
share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their
obligations. Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $28.7 million and
$6.8 million, respectively. In 2006, the Company provided $23.0 million of additional reserves,
including $0.8 million for existing sites and $22.2 million related to the recent acquisitions of
HCC ($21.2 million) and Land Instruments ($1.0 million). The additional reserves related to the
recent acquisitions were recorded through purchase accounting and did
not affect the Company’s
income statement. The Company spent $1.1 million and
$1.0 million, respectively, on such
environmental matters in 2006 and 2005. The Company also has agreements with former owners of
certain of its acquired businesses, including HCC, as well as new owners of previously owned
businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and
agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain
circumstances. In the case of HCC, the Company has assumed the liability for the performance of all
required remedial activities at the site and has obtained indemnifications and other financial
assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs for the required remedial activities.
The Company has recorded a total of $15.8 million of receivables in its balance sheet related to
the HCC matter for probable recoveries from third party escrow funds and other committed third
party funds to support the required remediation as well as a deferred
tax benefit of $2.8 million.
In addition, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for up to $19.0 million of
additional costs. The Company and some of the other parties also carry insurance coverage for some
environmental matters. To date, those parties have met their obligations in all material respects.
The Company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their
obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information
and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been
made, and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Market Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates on its
short-term and long-term debt, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for certain raw
material purchases.

The Company’s short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt
carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the
financial statements.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure
are the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi and the Mexican peso. Exposure
to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the
occasional use of local borrowings and the occasional use of derivative financial instruments in
the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into
U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income, within stockholders’ equity. Foreign
currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the
Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the
same foreign currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of
nickel, copper, steel and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally
mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product, and purchase order pricing
arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.



Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices, or
foreign currency exchange rates, our best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings,
fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments, and cash flows are not material, although the
actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995, which involve risk and uncertainties that
exist in the Company’s operations and
business environment, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown
risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Company’s actual
future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA
by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future
could cause, the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors
or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth
above and under Item 1A-Risk Factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise,
unless required by the securities laws to do so.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of the consolidated financial
statements and related information. The statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied and include certain amounts based on
management’s best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information elsewhere in this
report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial information, management
maintains a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
program. The system of controls provides for appropriate division of responsibility and the
application of written policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and records
are adequate for the preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate controls over financial
reporting. We maintain a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial
statements; however, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal
controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s activities according to
the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is characterized and
reflected in a code of business conduct for all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for
the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in other key policy
statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent
directors who are not employees of the Company, meets with the independent registered public
accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that each is properly
discharging its responsibilities. The report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy
Statement of the Company for its 2007 Annual Meeting. Both the independent registered public
accounting firm and the internal auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to
render an opinion as to whether management’s financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the Company’s financial position and operating results. This report is included on page
34.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on the
framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December
31, 2006.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on page 33.

AMETEK, Inc.

February 26, 2007



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

, that AMETEK, Inc. maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that AMETEK, Inc. maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO
criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated February 26,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 9, the accompanying financial statements have been retroactively
adjusted for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R),
“Share-based Payment” using the modified retrospective method.

As
discussed in Notes 3 and 12, the Company adopted the balance sheet
recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” as of December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations, financial position
and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc. (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the Company and
subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany transactions in the consolidation.
The Company’s investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted for by the equity
method of accounting. Such investments are not significant to the Company’s consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents, Securities, and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are
considered cash equivalents. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, all of the Company’s equity securities
and fixed-income securities (primarily those of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as
“available for sale”, although the Company may hold fixed-income securities until their maturity
dates. Fixed-income securities generally mature within four years. The aggregate market value of
equity and fixed-income securities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was: 2006 — $16.9 million ($15.7
million amortized cost) and 2005 — $15.7 million ($15.2 million amortized cost). The temporary
unrealized gain or loss on such securities is recorded as a separate
component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (in stockholders’ equity), and is not material. The Company had no
other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2006 or 2005. Certain of the Company’s other
investments, which are not significant, are accounted for by the equity method of accounting as
discussed above.

Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific
customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
receivables is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the
Company recognizes reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time specific
receivables are past due based on past experience. The allowance for possible losses on
receivables was $7.4 million and $7.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note
6.

Inventories

The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates
current replacement cost for approximately 55% of its inventories. The last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 45% of our inventory. For
inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO
value was approximately $34.1 million and $28.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete
inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be
experiencing financial difficulties, and related management initiatives.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions to plant
facilities, or that extend their useful lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and
dies, and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of plant and
equipment is calculated principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets. The range of lives for depreciable assets is generally 3 to 10 years for machinery
and equipment,
5 to 27 years for leasehold improvements and 25 to 50 years for buildings.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is
complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with
terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred,
collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small
percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize
revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition
are met. The policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the
customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Company’s option. We
have agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold
products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company at which time title and
risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts
for sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the income
statement. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances, and estimated warranty costs are
provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $10.9 million, $9.4 million and $7.3
million, respectively. The Company’s expense for warranty obligations approximated $7.6
million in 2006, $7.2 million in 2005 and $5.0 million in 2004. The warranty periods for
products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed
one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty
experience, and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Research and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and during
the past three years were: 2006-$42.0 million, 2005-$34.8 million and 2004-$25.5 million.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, and were: 2006 — $23.5 million,
2005 — $20.0 million, and 2004 — $16.5 million.

Earnings per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the effect of
all potentially dilutive securities (primarily outstanding common stock options and restricted
stock). The following table presents the number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings
per share and diluted earnings per share:

Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at
the balance sheet date, and their results of operations are translated using average exchange rates
for the year. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are made in currencies
other than their functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those transactions generally
are included in operating results for the year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial instruments. Foreign currency
forward contracts are entered into from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain
inventory purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the Company’s exposure to foreign currency
fluctuation. No forward contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2006 or 2005. In instances
where transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the gains and losses on those
transactions are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) within stockholders’
equity to the extent they are effective as hedges. The Company has designated certain
foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

operations. These net investment hedges relate to the Company’s British-pound-denominated
long-term debt and euro-denominated long-term debt pertaining to the Company’s acquisition of Land
Instruments in June 2006, Solartron in September 2005, Taylor Hobson in June 2004, and
Airtechnology in January 2003, which are U.K.-based businesses, and the SPECTRO business, which was
acquired in June 2005, and is a Germany-based business. These acquisitions were financed by
borrowings under AMETEK’s revolving credit facility and all except Land Instruments were
subsequently refinanced in the form of long-term private placement debt. These borrowings were
designed to create natural net investment hedges in each of the foreign subsidiaries mentioned on
their respective dates of acquisition. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

permits hedging the foreign currency exposure of
a net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS 133, on the respective dates of
acquisition, the Company designated the British pound- and euro-denominated loans referred to above
as hedging instruments to offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the net investment in the
acquired business due to changes in the British pound and euro exchange rates. These net
investment hedges were evidenced by management’s documentation supporting the contemporaneous hedge
designation on the acquisition dates. As required by SFAS 133, any gain or loss on the hedging
instrument following hedge designation (the debt), is reported in AOCI in the same manner as the
translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to
measure hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, all net investment hedges were
effective. At December 31, 2006, the translation gains on the net carrying value of the
foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the translation losses on the carrying value of
the underlying debt and are included in AOCI. An evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by
the Company on an ongoing basis and any desirable changes in the hedge are made as appropriate.

At
December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had $227.9 million
and $191.8 million,
respectively, of British pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge against the net
investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2006 and
2005, the Company had $66.0 million and $59.2 million of euro-denominated loans, which were
designated as a hedge against the net investment in a foreign subsidiary acquired in 2005. As a
result of these British pound- and euro-denominated loans being designated and effective as net
investment hedges, approximately $29.1 million of currency losses and $20.5 million of currency
gains have been included in the translation adjustment in other comprehensive income at December
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment.

Accordingly,
the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is now
recognized in the financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. The impact
of adopting SFAS 123R is discussed in Notes 3 and 9

.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Under SFAS 142, purchased goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and tradenames, are not amortized;
rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives will continue to be amortized over
their useful lives. Patents are being amortized over useful lives of 4 to 20 years. Customer
relationships are being amortized over a period of 2 to 20 years. Miscellaneous other intangible
assets are being amortized over a period of 13 to 20 years. The Company periodically evaluates the
reasonableness of the useful lives of these intangible assets.

In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment under
SFAS 142, a determination of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units and its other intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based upon,
among other things, estimates of future operating performance. Changes in market conditions, among
other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. The Company completed its required annual
impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2006, 2005 and 2004 and determined that the carrying
values of goodwill and other intangible assets
with indefinite lives were not impaired.

Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the related balance sheet accounts
require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax
regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits,
disputes and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make
judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and
liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to our tax assets and
liabilities may be necessary.

We also are required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, taking into
consideration our forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and
available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.
Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation
allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the
future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

2. Stock Split

On October 25, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a three-for-two split of the
Company’s common stock. The stock split resulted in the issuance of one additional share for every
two shares owned. The stock split was distributed on November 27, 2006, to shareholders of record
at the close of business on November 13, 2006. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a 50%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate on the Company’s common stock to $0.06 per common
share from $0.04 per common share on a post-split basis. All share and per share information
included in this report has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.

3. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued  SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans

. SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or
underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its
statement of financial position at year-end and to recognize changes in the funded status in the
year in which the changes occur through AOCI in stockholders’
equity. SFAS 158 was effective for
the Company as of December 31, 2006. The effect of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a decrease in
total assets of $43.1 million, a decrease in total liabilities
of $10.4 million, and a reduction of
total stockholders’ equity of $32.7 million, net of tax, as a charge to AOCI. (See Note 12).

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. SFAS 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require
any new fair value measurements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does
not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 will have an effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 creates a
single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions, by prescribing a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the Company will adopt FIN 48 as of January 1,
2007, as required. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded to retained earnings.
The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact of adopting FIN 48.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, using the
modified retrospective method. SFAS 123R requires the Company to expense the fair value of equity
awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is now recognized in the financial statements
over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 9.

In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 06-5,

Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance- Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in
Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-4

(EITF 06-5). EITF 06-5 provides guidance in
determining the amount to be realized under certain insurance contracts and the related
disclosures. EITF 06-5 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2006 and
should be adopted as a change in accounting principle, as a cumulative-effect adjustment to
retained earnings or as a retrospective adjustment to all prior periods. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adoption of EITF 06-5 on our financial statements.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”), which documents the SEC staff’s views regarding the process of
quantifying financial statement misstatements. Under SAB 108, an evaluation of the materiality of
an identified unadjusted error must consider the impact of both the current-year error and the
cumulative error, if applicable. This also means that both the impact on the current-period income
statement and the period-end balance sheet must be considered. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal
years ending after November 15, 2006. Any cumulative adjustments required to be recorded as a
result of adopting SAB 108 would be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings. Adoption of SAB 108 did not have an effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

4. Acquisitions

The Company spent $177.6 million, net of cash received, for five new businesses and two small
technology lines in 2006. The businesses acquired include Pulsar Technologies, Inc. (“Pulsar”) in
February 2006, PennEngineering Motion Technologies, Inc. (“Pittman”) in May 2006, Land Instruments
International Limited (“Land Instruments”) in June 2006, Precitech in November 2006 and Southern
Aeroparts, Inc. (“SAI”) in December 2006. Pulsar is a leading designer and manufacturer of
specialized communications equipment for the electric utility market. Pulsar is part of the
Company’s Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”). Pittman is a leading designer and manufacturer of
highly engineered motors. Pittman is part of the Company’s Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). Land
Instruments is a global supplier of high-end analytical instrumentation. Land Instruments is part
of EIG. Precitech is a leading manufacturer of ultraprecision machining systems for a variety of
markets, including nanotechnology, military, defense and ophthalmic. Precitech is part of EIG

.

SAI is a provider of third-party maintenance, repair and overhaul services to the commercial
aerospace industry. SAI is part of EMG. The five businesses acquired have annualized sales of
approximately $142 million.

The acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS
141,

Business Combinations

. Accordingly, the operating results of the above acquisitions are
included in the Company’s consolidated results from the dates of acquisition.

The following table presents the tentative allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the
2006 acquisitions based on their estimated fair values:

$

177.6

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits the Company expects to realize
from the acquisitions as follows: The Pulsar acquisition broadens the Company’s product offerings
in the electric utility market and complements the Company’s existing Power Instruments business.
The Pittman acquisition is a strategic fit with the Company’s highly differentiated technical motor
business and shares common markets, distribution channels and motor platforms. The Land
Instruments acquisition broadens the Company’s high-end process and analytical instruments business
through its extensive range of infrared temperature measurement, combustion efficiency and
emissions monitoring instruments. The Precitech acquisition broadens the Company’s high-end
analytical instrument platform for its rapidly growing nanotechnology applications. The SAI
acquisition expands the Company’s capabilities and enables the Company to offer the commercial
aerospace industry a wide array of third-party maintenance, repair and overhaul services. The
Company expects approximately $61 million of the goodwill recorded on the 2006 acquisitions will be
deductible in future years for tax purposes.

The Company is in the process of completing third-party valuations of certain tangible and
intangible assets acquired, as well as finalizing restructuring plans for certain acquisitions.
Adjustments to the allocation of purchase price will be recorded within the purchase price
allocation period of up to twelve months subsequent to the period of acquisition. Therefore, the
allocation of the purchase price is subject to revision.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The $22.1 million assigned to other intangible assets, related to the 2006 acquisitions, is
currently being valued by third-party appraisers. In connection with the finalization of the 2005
acquisitions, $96.2 million was assigned to intangible assets, which consisted primarily of
patents, technology, customer relationships and trade names with estimated lives ranging from two
to 20 years.

In 2005, the Company made three acquisitions. In October 2005, the company acquired HCC
Industries (“HCC”) for approximately $162 million in cash, net of cash received. HCC is a leading
designer and manufacturer of highly engineered hermetic connectors, terminals, headers and
microelectronics packages for sophisticated electronic applications in the aerospace, defense,
industrial and petrochemical markets. HCC is part of EMG. In September 2005, the Company acquired
the Solartron Group (“Solartron”) from Roxboro Group PLC for approximately 42 million British
pounds, or $75 million in cash, net of cash received. United Kingdom-based Solartron is a leading
supplier of analytical instrumentation for the process, laboratory, and other industrial markets.
Solartron is part of EIG. In June 2005, the Company acquired SPECTRO Beteiligungs GmbH (“SPECTRO”),
the holding company of SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH & Co. KG and its affiliates, from an
investor group led by German Equity Partners BV for approximately 80 million euros, or $96.9
million in cash, net of cash received. SPECTRO is a leading global supplier of atomic spectroscopy
analytical instrumentation. SPECTRO is a part of EIG. In the second and third quarters of 2005, the
Company also purchased two small technology lines for cash. The technologies acquired are related
to the Company’s brushless DC motor and precision pumping system businesses in its EMG and EIG,
respectively.

Had the 2006 acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2006, unaudited pro forma net sales,
net income, and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 would not have been
materially different than the amounts reported.

Had the 2006 acquisitions and the acquisitions of SPECTRO, Solartron, and HCC, which were
acquired in June, September, and October 2005, respectively, been made at the beginning of 2005,
pro forma net sales, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31,
2005 would have been as follows (in millions, except per share amount):

the acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 2005.

In 2004, the Company made two acquisitions. In June 2004, the Company acquired Taylor Hobson
Holdings Limited (“Taylor Hobson”) (recently renamed AMETEK Ultra Precision Technologies) for
approximately 51.0 million British pounds, or $93.8 million in cash, net of cash received. Taylor
Hobson is a leading manufacturer of ultraprecise measurement instrumentation for a variety of
markets, including optics, semiconductors, hard disk drives and nanotechnology research. Taylor
Hobson is a part of EIG. In July 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Hughes-Treitler Mfg. Corp. (“Hughes-Treitler”) for approximately $48.0 million in cash.

and $145.4 million in 2013 and thereafter.

At December 2006, the Company has outstanding an 18.0 million British pound ($35.2 million)
5.96% (London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .69%) floating-rate term loan with annual
installment payments due through 2010. In September 2005, the Company issued a 50 million euro
($66.0 million at December 31, 2006) 3.94% senior note due through 2015. In November 2004, the
Company issued a 40 million British pound ($78.3 million at December 31, 2006) 5.99% senior note
due in 2016. In September 2003, the Company issued a 50 million British pound ($97.9 million at
December 31, 2006) 5.96% senior note due in 2010.

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization facility agreement through a wholly
owned, special purpose subsidiary, and the special purpose subsidiary has a receivables sale
agreement with a bank whereby it could sell to a third party up to $75.0 million of its trade
accounts receivable on a revolving basis. The securitization facility is a financing vehicle
utilized by the Company because it offers attractive rates relative to other financing sources. All
securitized accounts receivable and related debt are reflected on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.

The special purpose subsidiary is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the
securitization facility. The accounts receivable securitization facility was amended in October
2006 to extend its expiration date to March 2007. The Company intends to renew the securitization
facility on an annual basis. Interest rates on amounts drawn down are based on prevailing market
rates for short-term commercial paper plus a program fee. The Company also pays a commitment fee
on any unused commitments under the securitization facility. The Company’s accounts receivable
securitization is accounted for as a secured borrowing under SFAS 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding debt on
the consolidated balance sheet were $75.0 million. Interest expense under this facility is not
significant. The weighted average interest rate on the amount outstanding under the accounts
receivable securitization at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 5.4% and 4.3%, respectively.

The Company has an unsecured $300 million Revolving Credit Facility, which was amended in
October 2006 to extend its expiration date from June 2010 to October 2011. The amendment also
lowers the Company’s cost of capital and provides the Company with increased financing flexibility
to support its growth plans.

The credit facility has an accordion feature that allows the Company to request up to an
additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the term of the
revolving credit agreement. Interest rates on outstanding loans under the



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revolving Credit
Facility are either at LIBOR plus a negotiated spread over LIBOR, or at the U.S. prime rate. At
December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had outstanding revolving credit loans of $96.7 million and
$71.2 million, respectively. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2006 includes an 8.4
million British pound ($16.5 million) borrowing related to the 2006 acquisition of Land
Instruments. It is the Company’s intent to use this 8.4 million British pound borrowing as a net
investment hedge. The Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $27.2 million and $26.9
million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Revolving Credit Facility places certain restrictions on allowable additional
indebtedness, which include the pro forma effect of potential acquisitions above a specified
dollar amount in certain debt covenant compliance calculations. At December 31, 2006 the Company
had available borrowing capacity of $276.1 million under its $400 million revolving bank credit
facility, which includes an accordion feature allowing $100 million of additional borrowing
capacity. The Revolving Credit Facility also places restrictions on certain cash payments, including the
payment of dividends. At December 31, 2006, retained earnings of approximately $49.0 million were
not subject to the dividend limitation.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit facilities with local foreign lenders
of approximately $86.8 million at December 31, 2006. Foreign subsidiaries had debt outstanding at
December 31, 2006 totaling $42.9 million, including $34.6 million reported in long-term debt.

The approximate weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006
and 2005 was 6.3% and 6.4%, respectively.

8. Stockholders’ Equity

In 2006, the Company repurchased 750,000 shares of its common stock for $21.1 million in cash
under its current share repurchase authorization. In 2005, the Company did not repurchase any
shares of its common stock under its current share repurchase authorization. At December 31, 2006,
approximately $31.4 million of the current share repurchase authorization was unexpended. At
December 31, 2006, the Company held approximately 2.4 million shares in its treasury at a cost of
$37.2 million, compared with approximately 1.8 million shares at a cost of $17.2 million at the end
of 2005. The number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2006 was 106.1 million shares, compared
with 105.7 million shares at December 31, 2005.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the Company’s Board of Directors
declared a dividend of one-half of a Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the
inception of the Plan. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving acquisition of the
Company’s common stock, that holders of Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be entitled
(i) to purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares
of common stock of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of twice the Rights
exercise price. The Rights under the Plan expire in June 2007.

9. Share-Based Compensation

Under the terms of the Company’s stockholder-approved share-based plans, incentive and
nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards have been, and may be, issued to the
Company’s officers, management-level employees and its Board of Directors. Employee and nonemployee
Director stock options and restricted stock awards generally have a four-year cliff vesting.
Options primarily have a maximum contractual term of 7 years. At December 31, 2006, 6.6 million
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company’s share-based plans, including
4.5 million stock options outstanding.

The Company issues previously unissued shares when options are exercised, and shares are
issued from treasury stock upon the award of restricted stock. Prior to January 1, 2006, the
Company accounted for share-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

, (“APB 25”) and related Interpretations. Under APB 25, no compensation expense was
required to be recognized for the Company’s stock options, provided the option exercise price was
established at least equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant.
Under APB 25, the Company was required to record compensation expense for the intrinsic value of
its restricted stock awards. Prior to 2006, the Company provided share-based compensation cost
information for all stock option awards in pro forma disclosures in the footnotes to its
consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R using the modified
retrospective transition method. Among other things, SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25 and the intrinsic
value method of accounting, and requires companies

to measure and record compensation expense related to all stock awards by recognizing the
unamortized grant date fair value of the awards over their requisite service periods in the
financial statements. For grants under any of the Company’s plans that are subject to graded
vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period for the entire award.

Under the modified
retrospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial
statements as if the recognition provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
had been applied to all share-based payments granted subsequent to the original effective date of
SFAS 123 (January 1, 1995). As such, operating results for periods prior to 2006 have been
retrospectively adjusted utilizing the fair value of stock options originally determined for the
purpose of providing the pro forma disclosures in the Company’s prior financial statements. As part
of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and the application of the modified retrospective transition method, the
Company recorded a charge to retained earnings of $17.1 million
and recorded a deferred tax asset of $3.5 million,
offset by a credit to capital in excess of par value of
$20.6 million for
the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 2003. The deferred tax asset represents the portion of the cumulative
expense related
to stock options expected to result in a future tax deduction for the
Company (See Note 11).

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company was required to record the total tax benefits
associated with the tax deduction generated from the exercise or disposition of stock options as an
operating cash inflow in its statement of cash flows. These amounts totaled $5.9 million, $12.0
million and $6.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. However, SFAS 123R requires that the
tax deduction in excess of recognized compensation cost be recorded as a financing cash inflow and
corresponding operating cash
reduction in the same amount. As shown in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows in
2006, $4.7 million of tax benefits have been classified as a financing cash inflow and a
corresponding amount as an operating cash reduction. The cash flow presentations in 2005 and 2004,
have been adjusted by $10.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively, to conform to the presentation
required by SFAS 123R.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in
the Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair values of options granted during the years
indicated:

Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company used
historical exercise data to estimate the options’ expected life, which represents the period of
time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the
future option holding periods will be similar to the historical option holding periods. The
risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve at the time of grant. Compensation expense recognized for all share-based awards is net
of estimated forfeitures. The Company’s estimated forfeiture rates are based on its historical
experience.

AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company’s accounting treatment for restricted stock awards is unchanged with the adoption
of SFAS 123R. The fair value of restricted shares under the Company’s restricted stock arrangement
is determined by the product of the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the
Company’s common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock, the fair value of the restricted shares
(unearned compensation) at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of capital in excess of par
value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, which is defined at the grant date. Restricted stock awards are also
subject to accelerated vesting due to certain events, including doubling of the grant price of the
Company’s common stock as of the close of business during any five consecutive trading days. On
February 20, 2007, the May 18, 2004 grant of 264,195 shares of restricted stock vested under this
accelerated vesting provision. The charge to income due to the accumulated vesting of these shares
will not have a material impact on our earnings in the first quarter of 2007, the period in which
such vesting occurred.

The total fair value of the restricted stock that vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was not

2004 was $25.19 and $18.64, respectively. Expected future pretax compensation expense related to
the 1.4 million nonvested restricted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2006 is $21.6 million,
which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) in
2006, the Company reserved 21,153 shares of common stock. Reductions
for retirement and terminations were 56,335 shares in 2006. The
total number of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was
245,773 as of December 31, 2006. Charges to expense under the SERP
are not significant in amount, and are considered pension expense
with the offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par
value.

10. Leases and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases in effect at December 31,
2006 (principally for production and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to $55.2
million, consisting of payments of $10.5 million in 2007, $8.1 million in 2008, $5.5 million in
2009, $3.7 million in 2010, $2.6 million in 2011, and $24.8 million in 2012 and thereafter. Rental
expense was $15.2 million in 2006, $14.5 million in 2005 and $11.3 million in 2004. The leases
expire over a range of years from 2007 to 2040, with renewal or purchase options, subject to
various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had $179.9 million and $129.4 million,
respectively, in purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of contractual
commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

The
Company has deferred tax liabilities for certain foreign entities
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for
Income Taxes - Special Areas

. The Company established an international holding company to own the
Company’s significant foreign operations so as to enhance flexibility and provide associated
benefits from tax and related financial perspectives. There has been no provision for U.S.
deferred income taxes for the undistributed earnings of certain other subsidiaries, which total



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

approximately $81.8 million at December 31, 2006, because the Company intends to reinvest these
earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United States. Upon distribution of those earnings
to the United States, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes based on the excess of the
U.S. statutory rate over the statutory rate in the foreign jurisdiction, and withholding taxes
payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred
income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

As
of December 31, 2006, the Company has tax benefits of
approximately $10.9 million related to net operating loss carryforwards which will be available to offset future income taxes payable,
subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax law. This amount
includes net operating loss carryforwards of $6.7 million for federal income tax purposes with a
valuation allowance of $3.6 million, $1.6 million for foreign income tax purposes, and $2.6 million
for state income tax purposes
with a full valuation allowance. These net operating loss carryforwards are primarily related
to recent acquisitions, and, if not used, will expire between 2007 and 2030. As of December 31,
2006, the Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5 million which will be available to
offset future income taxes payable subject to certain limitations
based on U.S. tax law and begin to expire in 2015.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts
that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax
assets established for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Any reductions in the
allowance resulting from the realization of the loss carryforwards of acquired companies will
result in a reduction of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, the Company maintained a valuation
allowance related to the deferred tax asset established for a foreign tax credit carryforward. In
2006, the Company implemented a new international holding company structure, which makes it more
likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be recognized in future periods. Therefore, the
Company determined that the valuation allowance was no longer necessary and recorded a
net reduction of $3.2 million.

12. Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans covering eligible salaried and
hourly employees. The plans generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of service
and/or compensation. The following is a brief description of the Company’s retirement and pension
plans.

As discussed in Note 3, we have adopted the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS 158
as of December 31, 2006.

The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. Benefits
for eligible salaried and hourly employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The Company’s funding policy with respect to its
defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits based on actuarial
calculations and the applicable requirements of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. AMETEK
estimates that it will make cash contributions of between $5 million and $14 million to its
worldwide defined benefit pension plans in 2007.

Presently, the Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal year-end) for its
U.S. defined benefit pension plans and an October 1 measurement date for its foreign defined
benefit pension plans. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, SFAS 158
requires the measurement date to be the Company’s fiscal year-end for all defined benefit plans.
The Company plans to early adopt the measurement date provision of SFAS 158 for our foreign plans
in 2007.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for eligible U.S. employees.
Participants in the savings plan may contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 6% of eligible
compensation or a maximum of $1,200 per participant.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined contribution retirement feature
principally to cover U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after December 31, 1996. Under the
retirement feature, the Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary subject to pre-established vesting.
Employees of certain of the Company’s foreign operations participate in various local defined
contribution plans.

The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for certain of its U.S. acquired
businesses for the benefit of eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed 6% of the participant’s base compensation.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its Directors and certain retired
employees. It also provides supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual arrangements
and/or a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) covering certain current and former
executives of the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate the executive for
retirement benefits that would have been provided under the Company’s primary retirement plan,
except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be taken into account under those plans.
The projected benefit obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be funded by a grant
of shares of the Company’s common stock upon retirement or termination of the executive. The
Company is providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the applicable periods.

The following tables set forth the changes in benefit obligations and the fair value of plan

Amounts in 2006 and 2005 include an approximate 10% investment in alternative assets
consisting of diversified funds of hedge funds. Amounts in 2006 and 2005 also include cash
and cash equivalents.

The fair value of plan assets for U.S. plans was $396.3 million and $356.9 million at December
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was
8.25% in 2006 and 8.50% in 2005. At December 31, 2006 and 2005 equity securities included 679,200
shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of $21.6 million (5.5% of total plan
investment assets) at December 31, 2006 and  a market value of
$19.3 million
(5.4% of total plan investment assets) at December 31, 2005, respectively.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit plans’ investment strategy are to
maximize the plans’ funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan expense. Because the
goal is to optimize returns over the long term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings
has been established. Since there may be periods of time where both equity and fixed-income markets
provide poor returns, an allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the overall
portfolio’s diversification and return potential. The Company periodically reviews its asset
allocation, taking into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment streams and the
investment strategy of the pension plans. The actual asset allocation is monitored frequently
relative to the established targets and ranges, and rebalanced when necessary.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and style. The equity portfolio
also includes an international component.

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets is to provide interest rate
sensitivity for a portion of the assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income portfolio
is diversified within certain quality and maturity guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse
effects of interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in note (a) above, certain
investments are prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital, private placements,
unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading, commodities, limited partnerships, short selling,
and rights and warrants. Foreign currency futures, options, and forward contracts may be used to
manage foreign currency exposure.

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit plans’ investment strategy is to
maximize the long-term rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable level of risk.
Liability studies are also performed on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment
goals with an objective to balance risks against the current and future needs of the plans. The
trustees consider the risk associated with the different asset classes, relative to the plans’
liabilities and how this can be affected by diversification, and the relative returns available on
equities, fixed-income investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those
returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are considered. It is expected that equities
will outperform fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the trustees recognize the
fact that fixed-income investments may better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
relatively young active employee group covered by the plans, and the immature nature of the plans,
the trustees have chosen to adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity
investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed from time to time in view of changes
in market conditions and in the plans’ liability profile.

At the end of 2006 and 2005, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation,
and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was developed based on a review of
historical investment returns for the investment categories for the defined benefit pension assets.
This review also considered current capital market conditions and expectations of projected future
investment returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset category are lower than
the actual long-term historical returns. The current low interest rate environment also influences
this outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. and foreign plans remains at 8.25% and
7.00%, respectively, for 2007.

Estimated
Future Benefit Payments

The estimated future benefit payments for U.S. and foreign plans are as follows (in
thousands): 2007 — $24,542; 2008 — $26,423; 2009 — $27,826; 2010 — $29,240; 2011 — $30,788; 2012 to
2016 — $195,619. Future benefit payments primarily represent amounts to be paid from pension
trust assets. Amounts included that are to be paid from the Company’s assets are not significant
in any individual year.

Postretirement Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than pensions for certain retirees
and a small number of former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and are
not significant.

The Company also provides limited post employment benefits for certain former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows employees whose compensation
exceeds the statutory IRS limit for retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed invested in either, or a combination
of, (a) an interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of the general assets of
the Company, or (b) the equivalent of a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common stock
on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the plan, including income earned, was $9.0
million and $7.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Administrative expense for
the plan is borne by the Company and is not significant.

13. Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are compared below to the
recorded amounts at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities

14. Additional Income Statement and Cash Flow Information

Included in other income are interest and other investment income of $0.7 million, $2.7
million, and $2.0 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Income taxes paid in 2006, 2005,
and 2004 were $67.2 million, $49.8 million, and $45.7 million, respectively. Cash paid for interest
was $41.7 million, $32.0 million, and $27.0 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

15. Business Segment and Geographic Information

Descriptive Information about Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, EIG and EMG. The Company manages, evaluates and
aggregates its operating segments for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
type, production processes, distribution methods, and management organizations.

EIG produces instrumentation for various electronic applications used in transportation
industries, including aircraft cockpit instruments and displays, airborne electronics systems that
monitor and record flight and engine data, and pressure, temperature, flow and liquid-level sensors
for commercial airlines and aircraft and jet engine manufacturers. EIG also produces analytical
instrumentation for the laboratory and research markets, as well as instruments for food
service equipment, measurement and monitoring instrumentation for various process industries and
instruments and complete instrument panels for heavy trucks and heavy construction and
agricultural vehicles. EIG also manufactures ultraprecise measurement instrumentation, as well as
thermoplastic compounds for automotive, appliance, and telecommunications applications.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

EMG produces brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass transit, medical equipment,
computer and business machine applications. EMG also produces high-purity metal powders and alloys
in powder, strip, and wire form for electronic components, aircraft and automotive products, as
well as heat exchangers and thermal management subsystems. EMG also supplies hermetically sealed
(moisture-proof) connectors, terminals and headers. These electromechanical devices are used in
aerospace, defense and other industrial applications. Additionally, EMG produces air-moving
electric motors and motor-blower systems for manufacturers of floor care appliances and outdoor
power equipment. Sales of floor care and specialty motors represented 15.6% in 2006, 19.2% in 2005
and 22.4% in 2004 of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Measurement of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs and expenses (including
certain administrative and other expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include an
allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are reported after elimination of intra- and
inter-segment sales and profits, which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are generally based
on prevailing market prices. Reported segment assets include allocations directly related to the
segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of investments, prepaid pensions,
insurance deposits, and deferred taxes.

16. Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. The Company
primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course
of its business to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of its
consolidated subsidiaries to support or enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness.
The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts
actually outstanding at any particular point in time. The maximum amount of future payment
obligations relative to these various guarantees was approximately $104.6 million, and the
outstanding liability under certain of those guarantees was approximately $39.2 million at
December 31, 2006. These guarantees expire in 2007 through 2010.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture transactions, the Company may
agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable
financial consequences resulting from specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations,
or retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee liabilities) whose terms
range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for
such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount of these types of
indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the overall maximum amount of the
obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company
indemnifies its directors and officers who are or were serving at the Company’s request in such
capacities. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related to these
indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The Company



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

believes that future payments,
if any, under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a material impact on its
results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Product Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The
warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most
part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past
warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Changes in the Company’s accrued product warranty obligation for 2006 and 2005 were as

17. Contingencies

Asbestos Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a defendant, along with many other
companies, in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate to
businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not involve products which were manufactured
or sold by the Company, or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which are under new
ownership. In connection with many of these lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such
businesses, as the case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these claims (the
“Indemnified Claims”). The Indemnified Claims
have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such sellers and new owners. These sellers
and new owners have met their obligations in all respects, and the Company does not have any reason
to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their obligations in the future. To date, no
judgments have been rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related lawsuit. The
Company believes it has strong defenses to the claims being asserted, and intends to continue to
vigorously defend itself in these matters.

Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally
hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these waste
products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time, at December 31, 2006
the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 16 non-AMETEK-owned former waste
disposal or treatment sites. The Company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these
sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed
to other named PRPs. In 11 of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the
cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements.
The agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other two sites, the Company is
continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated
by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate
settlement amount. In the three remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP,
the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a
PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s expected
obligation.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels
and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-AMETEK-owned former
waste disposal or treatment sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing
locations. For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental
matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of
investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability
based on the low-end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation
of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates, and the amounts accrued in the
financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a
material change to the financial statements. In estimating our liability for remediation, we also
consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of
the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations. Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2006 and
2005 were $28.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively. In 2006, the Company provided $23.0 million
of additional reserves, including $0.8 million for existing sites and $22.2 million related to the
recent acquisitions of HCC ($21.2 million) and Land Instruments ($1.0 million). The additional
reserves related to the recent acquisitions were recorded through purchase accounting and did not
affect the Company’s income statement. The Company spent $1.1 million and $1.0 million,
respectively on such environmental matters in 2006 and 2005. The Company also has agreements with
former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, including HCC, as well as new owners of
previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or
assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
under certain circumstances. In the case of HCC, the Company has assumed the liability for the
performance of all required remedial activities at the site and has obtained indemnifications and
other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs for the required
remedial activities. The Company has recorded a total of $15.8 million of receivables in its
balance sheet related to the HCC matter for probable recoveries from third party escrow funds and
other committed third party funds to support the required remediation as well as a deferred tax
benefit of $2.8 million. In addition, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for up to
$19.0 million of additional costs. The Company and some of the other parties also carry insurance
coverage for some environmental matters. To date, those parties have met their obligations in all
material respects. The Company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to
perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently
available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for
probable costs has been made, and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to
materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the
Company.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed, is accumulated
and communicated to management in a timely manner. The Company’s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the system of disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2006. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in all material respects as of December 31, 2006.

Such evaluation did not identify any change in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting during the year ended December 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting
