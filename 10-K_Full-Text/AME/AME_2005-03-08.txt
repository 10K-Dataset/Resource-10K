PART I

Item 1.

Business

General Development of Business

AMETEK, Inc. (“AMETEK” or the “Company”) is
incorporated in Delaware. Its predecessor was originally
incorporated in Delaware in 1930 under the name American Machine
and Metals, Inc. The Company maintains its principal executive
offices in suburban Philadelphia, PA at 37 North Valley Road,
Paoli, PA 19301. AMETEK is a leading global manufacturer of
electronic instruments and electric motors with operations in
North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The Company is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock
Exchange (symbol: AME). AMETEK is a component of the Russell
1000 and the S&P MidCap 400 indices.

Recent Developments

Stock Split.

On January 27, 2004, the Company’s
Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of its common
stock, distributed on February 27, 2004, to shareholders of
record on February 13, 2004. The stock split has broadened
the stock’s marketability and improved its trading
liquidity. All share and per share information included in this
Form 10-K is presented on a post-stock split basis.

Dividend Increase.

On January 27, 2004, the
Company’s Board of Directors approved a 100% increase to
its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock, to an indicated
annual rate of $0.24 per share on a post-stock split basis.
The first increased quarterly dividend was paid on
March 26, 2004 to shareholders of record on March 12,
2004.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan Change.

Beginning
in 2004, the Company adopted a change in the composition of its
long-term compensation plan. The value of stock awards under its
long-term incentive plan for officers of the Company and other
senior management personnel is now composed of approximately 50%
restricted stock and 50% stock options, rather than primarily
stock options as it had been previously. This change resulted in
the Company expensing approximately one-half of its future
long-term compensation awards under current accounting rules.
The Company believes this new arrangement will enhance the
Company’s ability to attract and retain management talent.

Financing.

On February 27, 2004, the Company
announced that it had amended its $300 million Revolving
Credit Facility to extend the expiration date from September
2006 to February 2009. The new 5-year term of this Credit
Facility provides the Company with increased flexibility to
support its growth plans, including its acquisition strategy.
Other key terms of the Credit Facility were unchanged. Also in
2004, the Company borrowed 40 million British pounds
($76.7 million) under a twelve-year term loan to finance
the purchase of the Taylor Hobson business in June 2004.

Increase in Authorized Shares of Common Stock.

At the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 18, 2004,
stockholders approved an amendment to the Certificate of
Incorporation, increasing the number of shares of Common Stock
the Company is authorized to issue from 100,000,000 to
200,000,000.


Products and Services

The Company markets its products worldwide through two operating
groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and
the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). EIG builds
monitoring, testing, and calibration instruments and display
devices for the process, analytical, aerospace, industrial and
power markets. The Company believes that EMG is the world’s
largest manufacturer of air-moving electric motors for vacuum
cleaners, and is a prominent producer of other floor care
products and brushless air-moving motors for aerospace,
mass-transit, medical and office product markets. EMG also
produces specialty metals for automotive, consumer, electronics,
telecommunications and other markets and offers switches for
motive and stationary power applications. The Company continues
to grow through strategic acquisitions primarily focused on
differentiated niche markets in instrumentation, technical
motors and specialty metals.

Competitive Strengths

Management believes that the Company has several significant
competitive advantages that assist it in sustaining and
enhancing its market positions. Its principal strengths include:

Significant Market Share.

AMETEK maintains significant
share in many of its targeted niche markets because of its
ability to produce and deliver high-quality products at
competitive prices. In EIG, the Company maintains significant
market positions in many niche segments within the process,
analytical, aerospace, industrial, and power instrumentation
markets. In EMG, the Company believes it is the largest
manufacturer of air-moving electric motors for the global floor
care market.

Technological and Development Capabilities.

AMETEK
believes it has certain technological advantages over its
competitors that allow it to develop innovative products and
maintain leading market positions. Historically, the Company has
grown by extending its technical expertise into the manufacture
of customized products for its customers as well as through
strategic acquisitions. EIG competes primarily on the basis of
product innovation in several highly specialized instrumentation
markets, including process measurement, heavy-vehicle dashboard,
power and aerospace instruments. An example of EIG’s
ability to take a technical innovation developed for one market
into a related market was the leveraging of its core competency
in jet engine temperature sensors into developing similar
products for power generation applications, particularly
land-based gas turbines. EMG focuses on low-cost design and
manufacturing, while enhancing motor-blower performance through
advances in power, efficiency, lighter weight and quieter
operation. The Company believes that EMG’s leadership in
motor technology has allowed it to develop a range of product
features for its motors and motor-blowers that create new market
opportunities for its products.

Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing Operations.

AMETEK
has motor manufacturing plants in China, the Czech Republic,
Mexico and Brazil to lower its costs and achieve strategic
proximity to its customers, providing the opportunity to
increase international sales and market share in EMG. Certain of
the Company’s electronic instrument businesses are
relocating manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and joint ventures in
Europe, North America and Asia have resulted in additional cost
savings and synergies through the consolidation of operations,
product lines and distribution channels that benefit both
operating groups.

Experienced Management Team.

Another key component of
AMETEK’s success is the strength of its management team and
its commitment to the performance of the Company. AMETEK’s
senior management has extensive experience, averaging more than
nineteen years with the Company, and is financially committed to
the Company’s success through Company-established stock
ownership guidelines based on a set of salary multiples.

Business Strategy

AMETEK’s objectives are to increase the Company’s
earnings and financial returns through a combination of
operational and financial strategies. Those operational
strategies include business acquisitions, new product
development, global and market expansion, and cost-reduction
programs designed to achieve double-digit annual percentage
growth in earnings per share and a superior return on total
capital. To support those


operational objectives, financial initiatives have been, or may
be, undertaken, including public and private debt or equity
issuance, bank debt refinancing, local-source financing in
certain foreign countries, accounts receivable securitization
and share repurchases. AMETEK’s commitment to earnings
growth is reflected in its continued implementation of
cost-reduction programs designed to achieve the Company’s
long-term best-cost objectives.

AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key
strategies:

Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The Company
continues to pursue strategic acquisitions, both domestically
and internationally, to expand and strengthen its product lines,
improve its market share positions and increase earnings through
sales growth and operational efficiencies at the acquired
businesses. Since the beginning of 2002, to the date of this
report, the Company has completed five acquisitions with
annualized sales totaling approximately $220 million,
including two 2004 acquisitions representing approximately
$100 million in annualized revenues (see “Recent
Acquisitions”). Those acquisitions have enhanced
AMETEK’s position in analytical instrumentation, technical
motors, and electrical power instruments and systems. Through
these and prior acquisitions, the Company’s management team
has gained considerable experience in successfully acquiring and
integrating new businesses. The Company intends to continue to
pursue this acquisition strategy.

Global and Market Expansion.

AMETEK’s largest
international presence is in Europe, where it has operations in
the United Kingdom, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Czech Republic,
France, Austria and the Netherlands. These operations provide
design and engineering capability, product-line breadth,
enhanced European distribution channels, and low-cost
production. AMETEK has a leading market position in European
floor care motors and a significant presence in many of its
instrument businesses. It has grown sales in Latin America and
Asia by building and expanding low-cost electric motor and
instrument plants in Reynosa, Mexico, and motor manufacturing
plants near Sao Paulo, Brazil and in Shanghai, China. It also
continues to achieve geographic expansion and increased market
expansion in Asia through joint ventures in China, Taiwan, Japan
and South Korea and a direct sales and marketing presence in
Singapore, Japan, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

New Product Development.

Through its new product
development efforts, AMETEK seeks to improve its existing market
positions and enter complementary markets.

Among the new products introduced by EIG in 2004 are the Trident
System from AMETEK EDAX that integrates three state-of-the-art
microanalytical tools into a single integrated system. The
combination of the three techniques provides users with a
powerful tool for conducting elemental microanalysis.

In 2004, EIG also launched additions to the ProcessPower®
family of uninterruptible power supply systems from Solidstate
Controls. These systems are ideally suited to the needs of the
chemical, offshore oil and gas exploration and production,
process control, power generation, and petrochemical industries
in providing clean, continuous power to critical loads.

EIG also launched a new generation of active fuel probes and
advanced solid-state aircraft power distribution subsystems from
AMETEK Aerospace. The new active fuel probes offer distinct
performance advantages over alternative gauging technologies.
AMETEK’s patented AMPHION technology represents an entirely
new architecture for the control and distribution of aircraft
power.

AMETEK Dixson expanded its fully digital, multiplexed Next
Generation Instrument (NGI) subsystem for heavy-duty trucks
with custom dashboard instrument clusters for agricultural and
construction equipment, buses and recreational vehicles.

During 2004, EMG introduced
Nautilair

tm

variable-speed burner blowers for industrial furnaces and
Seal-less

tm

magnetically coupled water circulation pumps for mass transit
vehicles from the Company’s Technical and Industrial
Products division.
Nautilair

tm

blowers represent the next level of air performance. They
utilize a next-generation electronic drive control that can be
customized to customer needs.
Seal-less

tm

pumps offer long life and virtually maintenance-free operation.


In Floor Care Motors, a new motor lamination allows commercial
vacuum motors to achieve new levels of efficiency and
performance. The new lamination sets the stage for further
performance enhancements as new fan designs are coupled to the
faster, more efficient motors.

Operational Excellence.

Operational Excellence is
AMETEK’s keystone strategy for improving profit margins and
strengthening the Company’s competitive position across its
businesses. Through its Operational Excellence strategy, the
Company seeks to reduce production costs and improve its market
positions. The strategy has played a key role in achieving
synergies from newly acquired companies. AMETEK believes that
Operational Excellence’s focus on Six Sigma process
improvements and flow manufacturing, and its emphasis on team
building and a participative management culture, have enabled
the Company to improve operating efficiencies and product
quality, increase customer satisfaction and yield higher cash
flow from operations, while lowering operating and
administrative costs and shortening manufacturing cycle times.

2004 Overview

Operating Performance

In 2004, AMETEK generated sales of more than $1.2 billion,
and increased net income by 28%. The Company set records for
sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per
share. This strong performance was driven by an improving
economy, internal growth in each of the Company’s two
segments, the contribution of recently acquired businesses and
the Company’s continuing cost-reduction initiatives.

AMETEK generated cash flow from operating activities during 2004
that totaled approximately $161 million, a 4% increase from
2003. The primary contributor to that growth in cash flow was
increased earnings, offset by higher working capital
requirements to support the Company’s sales growth.

Recent Acquisitions

On June 18, 2004, the Company acquired Taylor Hobson
Holdings Limited (Taylor Hobson) from funds advised by Permira,
for approximately 51 million British pounds, or
approximately $94 million in cash, net of cash received.
Taylor Hobson is a leading manufacturer of ultraprecise
measurement instrumentation for a variety of markets, including
optics, semiconductors and hard disk drives. Taylor Hobson has
annualized sales of approximately 38 million British
pounds, or $70 million. Taylor Hobson is a part of the

Financial Information about Operating Segments, Foreign
Operations, and Export Sales

Reportable segment and geographic information is shown on
pages 57-59 of this report.

The Company’s Global and Market Expansion growth strategy
is subject to certain risks that are inherent in conducting
business outside the United States. Those include fluctuations
in currency exchange rates and controls, restrictions on the
movement of funds, import and export controls, and other
economic, political, tax and regulatory policies of the
countries in which business is conducted.

The Company’s foreign sales (approximately 44% of total
sales in 2004) have resulted from a combination of internal
growth and acquisitions. This combination has resulted in
increases in export sales of products manufactured in the United
States and sales from overseas operations.


Description of Business

The products and markets of each operating segment are described
below:

EIG

EIG applies its specialized market focus and technology to
produce testing, monitoring, and calibration instruments for the
process, analytical, aerospace, industrial and power markets.
EIG’s growth is based on the four strategies outlined in

and can intensify for certain EIG products, especially its
pressure gauge and heavy-vehicle instrumentation. Both of these
businesses have several strong competitors. In the process and
analytical instruments markets, numerous companies in each
specialized market compete on the basis of


product quality, performance and innovation. The aerospace and
power instruments businesses have a number of diversified
competitors, which vary depending on the specific market niche.

EMG has limited domestic competition in the U.S. floor care
market from independent manufacturers. Competition is increasing
from Asian motor manufacturers that serve both the U.S. and the
European floor care markets. Increasingly, global vacuum motor
production is being shifted to Asia where AMETEK has a weaker
market position. In Europe, competition is limited to a single
major competitor and several smaller competitors. There is
potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers
of floor care products that produce their own motor-blowers.
Many of these manufacturers would also be potential
EMG customers if they decided to outsource their motor
production. EMG’s differentiated businesses have
competition from a limited number of companies in each of their
markets. Competition is generally based on product innovation,
performance and price. EMG’s specialty metal products
business has several specialized product lines that have few
competitors. The primary competition is from alternative
materials and processes.

Backlog and Seasonal Variations of Business

The Company’s approximate backlog of unfilled orders by

The higher backlog at December 31, 2004 was primarily due
to the two businesses acquired in 2004, as well as increased
order rates, primarily from the Company’s differentiated
businesses.

Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31,
2004, approximately 94% is expected to be shipped by
December 31, 2005. The Company believes that neither its
business as a whole, nor either of its operating segments, is
subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain
individual operations experience some seasonal variability.

Availability of Raw Materials

The Company’s business segments obtain raw materials and
supplies from a variety of sources, and generally from more than
one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various
base metals and certain steel components, are available only
from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes its
sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs.

Research, Product Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development, and
engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
potential new and improved products or enhance existing
products. Research, product development, and engineering costs
before customer reimbursement were $66.0 million,
$56.1 million and $46.8 million, in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2004, 2003 and
2002 were $6.2 million, $6.2 million and
$8.0 million, respectively. These amounts included net
Company-funded research and development expenses of
$25.5 million, $21.4 million and $23.7 million,
respectively. Such expenditures were directed toward the
development of new products and processes, and the improvement
of existing products and processes.

foreign patents, including counterparts of its more important
U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the
world. The Company is a licensor or licensee under patent
agreements of various types, and its products are marketed under
various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign trademarks
and trade names. However, the Company does not consider any
single patent or trademark, or any group thereof, essential
either to its business as a whole or to either of its business
segments. The annual royalties received or paid under license
agreements are not significant to either of its business
segments or to the Company’s overall operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2004, the Company employed approximately
8,300 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of
whom approximately 2,800 employees were covered by
collective bargaining agreements.

Working Capital Practices

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital
requirements in either of its business segments. Customers
generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include
extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled
and maintained at levels related to production cycles, and are
responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.

Item 2.

Properties

The Company has 54 operating plant facilities in
17 states and 11 foreign countries. Of these
facilities, 38 are owned by the Company and 16 are leased. The
properties owned by the Company consist of approximately
576 acres, of which approximately 4.2 million square
feet are under roof. Under lease is a total of approximately
897,000 square feet. The leases expire over a range of
years from 2005 to 2031, with renewal options for varying terms
contained in most of the leases. Production facilities in
Taiwan, China, Japan and South Korea provide the Company with
additional production capacity through the Company’s
investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures. The
Company’s executive offices in Paoli, PA, occupy
approximately 34,000 square feet under a lease that will
expire in 2007.

The Company’s machinery, plants, and offices are in
satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the uses
to which they are put. The operating facilities of the Company

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

See notes to Selected Financial Data on page 14.


Notes to Selected Financial Data

(1)

Amounts in 2001 included unusual pretax charges totaling
    $23.3 million, $15.3 million after tax ($0.23 per
    diluted share). The charges were for employee reductions,
    facility closures and asset writedowns. The year 2001 also
    included a tax benefit and related interest income of
    $10.5 million after tax ($0.16 per diluted share)
    resulting from the closure of a number of tax years.

(2)

Amounts in 2001 and 2000 include the amortization of goodwill.
    Beginning in 2002, the Company accounted for goodwill under
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, which no
    longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets. Had the Company not amortized goodwill, net
    income and diluted earnings per share would have been higher by
    $10.2 million ($0.15 per diluted share) and
    $9.2 million ($0.14 per diluted share) in 2001 and
    2000, respectively.

(3)

EBITDA represents income before income taxes, interest,
    depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because the
    Company is aware that it is used by rating agencies, securities
    analysts, investors and other parties in evaluating the Company.
    It should not be considered, however, as an alternative to
    operating income as an indicator of the Company’s operating
    performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of
    the Company’s overall liquidity as presented in the
    Company’s financial statements. Furthermore, EBITDA
    measures shown for the Company may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table
    below presents the reconciliation of net income reported in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP to EBITDA.

(4)

Free cash flow represents cash flow from operating activities,
    before the effects of an accounts receivable securitization
    program, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented
    because the Company is aware that it is used by rating agencies,
    securities analysts, investors and other parties in evaluating
    the Company. (Also see note 3 above). The table below
    presents the reconciliation of operating cash flow from
    operating activities reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP
    to free cash flow.

The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition
(“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with
“Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related
notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Business Overview

As a multinational business, AMETEK’s operations are
affected by global, regional and industry economic factors.
However, the Company’s strategic geographic and industry
diversity, and its mix of products and services, have helped to
limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable
developments in any one industry or the economy of any single
country on its consolidated operating results. In 2004, the
Company continued to experience improved market conditions in
most of its businesses. The improving economy, strong internal
growth and acquisitions combined with successful operational
excellence initiatives enabled the Company to post another year
of record sales, operating income, net income, and diluted
earnings per share in 2004. In addition to achieving its
financial objectives, the Company also continued to make
progress on its strategic initiatives under AMETEK’s four
growth strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic
Acquisitions and Alliances, Global and Market Expansion and New
Products. Highlights of 2004 were:

•

In June 2004, the Company acquired Taylor Hobson Holdings
    Limited (Taylor Hobson), significantly expanding its measurement
    capabilities into ultraprecise applications.

•

In July 2004, the Company acquired the assets of Hughes-Treitler
    Mfg. Corp. (Hughes-Treitler), increasing its thermal management
    product offering to the military and commercial aerospace
    markets.

•

As the Company grows globally, it continues to achieve an
    increasing level of international sales. With this increase in
    international sales comes more exposure to foreign currency
    fluctuation. In 2004, foreign currency translation had a
    positive impact on sales, primarily as a result of the continued
    strength of the British pound and the euro in relation to the
    U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation

Year Ended December 31, 2004, Compared with Year Ended
December 31, 2003

Results of Operations

In 2004, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
income, and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved
these results from an improving economy, internal growth in both
its Electronics Instruments (EIG) and Electromechanical
(EMG) groups, acquisitions and cost reduction programs. The
Company experienced improved market conditions in most of its
businesses in 2004. Sales and orders continued to benefit from
the broad-based economic improvement impacting the
Company’s short-cycle businesses as well as improvement in
its long-cycle aerospace business. The Company’s
cost-driven floor care


and specialty motors businesses were mainly flat in 2004. The
Company expects the economic rebound to continue benefiting both
its short-cycle and long-cycle businesses in 2005.

The Company reported sales for 2004 of $1,232.3 million, an
increase of $140.7 million or 12.9% from sales of
$1,091.6 million in 2003. Net sales for the Electronic
Instruments Group (EIG) were $667.4 million in 2004,
an increase of 18.8% from sales of $561.9 million in 2003.
The 2004 sales increase for EIG was driven by the acquisitions
of Taylor Hobson in June 2004 and Chandler Instruments in August
2003. Strength in the high-end analytical instruments business,
the heavy-vehicle instruments business, and the aerospace and
power businesses also contributed to the increase. Net sales for
the Electromechanical Group (EMG) were $564.9 million
in 2004, an increase of 6.6% from sales of $529.7 million
in 2003 primarily driven by strength in its differentiated
businesses and the acquisition of Hughes-Treitler in July 2004.
The Group’s cost-driven floor care and specialty motors
businesses were mainly flat in 2004. Strengthening foreign
currencies also contributed $22.5 million to the overall
sales increase, primarily from the British pound and the euro.
The noted acquisitions increased 2004 sales by
$53.6 million or 4.3%.

Total international sales for 2004 increased to
$536.5 million or 43.5% of consolidated sales, an increase
of $100.8 million when compared with $435.7 million or
39.9% of sales in 2003. The increase in international sales
primarily resulted from the acquisitions previously mentioned as
well as increased international sales from base businesses.
Export shipments from the United States, which are included in
total international sales, were $232.0 million in 2004, an
increase of 15.5% compared with $200.8 million in 2003.

New orders for 2004 were $1,287.0 million, compared with
$1,136.9 million for 2003, an increase of
$150.1 million or 13.2%. The order backlog at
December 31, 2004 was $340.9 million, compared with
$286.2 million at December 31, 2003, an increase of
$54.7 million or 19.1%. The increase in orders and backlog
was due mainly to the two acquisitions completed in 2004 along
with increased order levels primarily in the Company’s
differentiated businesses.

Segment operating income was $220.6 million for 2004, an
increase of 23.2%, compared with segment operating income of
$179.1 million for 2003. Segment operating margins in 2004
were 17.9% of sales, an increase from 16.4% of sales in 2003.
The increase in segment operating income resulted from the
profit contributions of the acquisitions, strength in the
differentiated businesses of each Group, slightly higher profits
by the cost-driven floor care and specialty motors businesses,
and the benefits from the Company’s ongoing cost reduction
programs. Segment operating income for 2004 also includes a
$5.3 million pre-tax gain from the settlement of a flood
insurance claim involving a manufacturing plant, and lower
pension expense. The lower pension expense was substantially
offset by higher employee-related expenses. The cost reduction
initiatives are part of the Company’s successful
operational excellence strategy and include the continued
migration of production to low-cost locales in Mexico, China and
the Czech Republic and the aggressive lowering of the
Company’s overall cost structure.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were
$135.5 million in 2004, compared with $115.2 million
in 2003, an increase of $20.3 million or 17.6%. As a
percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 11.0% in 2004,
compared with 10.6% in 2003. Selling expenses, as a percentage
of sales, increased to 9.1% in 2004, compared to 8.5% in 2003.
The selling expense increase, and the corresponding increase as
a percentage of sales, was due primarily to the acquired
businesses. The acquisitions added 1.2% to selling expense in
2004 as a percentage of sales. The Company’s acquisition
strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses,
which because of their distribution channels and higher
marketing costs tend to have higher selling expenses. Selling
expense as a percentage of sales by base businesses was lower
when compared with the prior year, and reflects the
Company’s focus on cost reduction initiatives as a part of
its operational excellence strategy.

Corporate administrative expenses were $24.4 million in
2004, an increase of $2.0 million or 9.0%, when compared
with 2003. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative
expenses were 2.0% in 2004, which is unchanged from 2003. The
increase in 2004 corporate expenses was primarily the result of
higher legal, professional and consulting fees as well as higher
overall compensation expenses. The higher professional and
consulting fees are primarily the result of the Company’s
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiatives associated with reporting
on the Company’s internal controls for 2004. Corporate
administrative expenses in 2003


included a $2.1 million one-time, noncash expense, from the
accelerated cost recognition due to the vesting of a restricted
stock grant.

After deducting corporate administrative expenses, consolidated
operating income was $196.2 million, an increase of
$39.4 million or 25.2% when compared with
$156.8 million in 2003. This represents an operating margin
of 15.9% of sales for 2004 compared with 14.4% of sales in 2003.

Interest expense was $28.3 million in 2004, an increase of
8.9% compared with $26.0 million in 2003. The increase was
due to higher average interest rates on British pound borrowings
incurred in connection with acquisitions in the United Kingdom
in 2004 and 2003. Other expenses increased $1.5 million to
$2.1 million in 2004 as a result of increases in
non-operating expenses, including bank fees and expenses
associated with acquisitions not consummated.

The effective tax rate for 2004 was 32.0% compared with 32.5% in
2003. The tax rate in 2004 reflects higher tax benefits in
connection with U.S. export sales. The 2003 tax rate
reflects the nondeductibility of the noncash expense from the
acceleration of restricted stock expense, mentioned earlier.
While the Company is still evaluating the potential future
effects of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, it expects
any impact to be insignificant.

Net income for 2004 was $112.7 million, an increase of
$24.9 million, or 28.4%, from $87.8 million in 2003.
Diluted earnings per share rose 25.4% to $1.63 per share,
an increase of $0.33, when compared with $1.30 per diluted
share in 2003.

Operating Segment Results

Electronic Instruments Group

(EIG) sales were
$667.4 million in 2004, an increase of 18.8% from 2003
sales of $561.9 million. The sales increase was primarily
from the 2004 Taylor Hobson acquisition and the 2003 Chandler
Instruments acquisition, internal sales growth from strength in
the Group’s high-end analytical instrumentation,
heavy-vehicle, and aerospace businesses as well as a favorable
foreign currency translation impact of $7.4 million. The
acquisitions increased 2004 group sales by $62.5 million or
9.4%.

EIG’s operating income for 2004 increased to
$126.4 million from $95.0 million in 2003, an increase
of $31.4 million, or 33.1%. The increase was primarily
driven by the recent acquisitions, and the contributions from
internal growth previously mentioned, as well as the benefits
from ongoing cost reduction initiatives. As part of these cost
reduction initiatives, in the third quarter of 2004, the Group
incurred $2.4 million of charges related to a product line
relocation and the settlement of two union contracts.
Additionally, the Group experienced higher employee compensation
and workers’ compensation insurance expense in 2004.
Operating income for EIG for 2004 also included a
$5.3 million pre-tax gain from the insurance settlement of
a previously disclosed flood claim at one of the Group’s
manufacturing plants. The flood gain results from the
finalization of the Company’s claim for damage to the
building, its contents, and the operating assets affected by the
flood as well as settlement of business interruption and other
expenses. As a result of the flood, the Company has ceased
operations at this site. Operating margins of EIG improved to
18.9% of sales for 2004 compared with operating margins of 16.9%
of sales in 2003.

Electromechanical Group

(EMG) sales for 2004 were
$564.9 million, an increase of $35.2 million or 6.6%,
compared with sales of $529.7 million in 2003. The sales
increase was a result of the Hughes-Treitler acquisition and
$15.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation
effects as well as strength in the Group’s differentiated
businesses. The Group’s cost-driven floor care and
specialty motors businesses were mainly flat in 2004. However,
toward the end of 2004, the Company began to see some
stabilization in these markets. The Hughes-Treitler acquisition
increased 2004 group sales by $14.9 million or 2.6%.

EMG’s operating income for 2004 increased to
$94.3 million from $84.2 million in 2003, an increase
of $10.1 million or 12.0%. The higher profit was the result
of the Hughes-Treitler acquisition, strength in the Group’s
differentiated businesses, slightly higher profits by the floor
care and specialty motors businesses, and the benefits of
ongoing cost reduction programs. In the fourth quarter of 2004,
the group incurred $2.5 million of expense related to
severance and the acceleration of depreciation expense
associated with the planned movement of production to low-cost
manufacturing locales. Additionally, the Group experienced higher


employee compensation and workers’ compensation insurance
expense in 2004. The Group’s operating margins for 2004
improved to 16.7% of sales compared with operating margins of
15.9% of sales in 2003.

Year Ended December 31, 2003, Compared with Year Ended
December 31, 2002

Results of Operations

In 2003, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
income, and diluted earnings per share, despite the difficult
economic environment within the manufacturing sector. These
records were achieved through contributions from the 2003
acquisitions, as well as higher sales due to strengthening
foreign currencies. Margins benefited from the acquisitions, as
well as from continued cost reduction initiatives in base
businesses.

The Company reported sales in 2003 of $1,091.6 million, an
increase of $51.1 million or 4.9% from sales of
$1,040.5 million in 2002. Strengthening foreign currencies
contributed $23.9 million to the sales increase. The
economic slowdown that affected the manufacturing sector
impacted many of the Company’s businesses. Net sales for
the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) were
$561.9 million in 2003, an increase of 4.2% from sales of
$539.4 million in 2002. The 2003 sales increase for EIG was
due mainly to the first quarter 2003 acquisition of Solidstate
Controls, Inc. (SCI) and the third quarter 2003 acquisition
of Chandler Instruments Company, LLC (Chandler), as well as
strength in the high-end analytical instruments business,
partially offset by continued weakness in the aerospace and
power businesses. Net sales for the Electromechanical Group
(EMG) were $529.7 million in 2003, an increase of 5.7%
from sales of $501.1 million in 2002 primarily driven by
the first quarter 2003 acquisition of Airtechnology Holdings
Limited (Airtechnology). The EMG sales increase was partially
offset by a decline in sales within the Group’s floor care
and specialty motors businesses.

Total international sales were $435.7 million in 2003 and
represented 39.9% of consolidated net sales, compared with
$353.4 million or 34.0% of sales in 2002. International
sales increased 23.3% in 2003, primarily due to the 2003
acquisitions. Export shipments from the United States in 2003
were $200.8 million, an increase of 4.6% compared with
$192.0 million in 2002.

New orders in 2003 were $1,136.9 million, compared with
$1,004.8 million in 2002, an increase of
$132.1 million or 13.1%. The order backlog at
December 31, 2003 was $286.2 million, compared with
$240.9 million at December 31, 2002, an increase of
$45.3 million or 18.8%. The increase in orders and backlog
was due mainly to the three acquisitions completed in 2003. The
Company experienced order declines in its floor care and
specialty motors businesses.

Segment operating income was $179.1 million in 2003, an
increase of 6.8%, compared with segment operating income of
$167.7 million in 2002. Segment operating margins in 2003
were 16.4% of sales, an increase from 16.1% of sales in 2002.
The increase in segment operating income resulted from the
profit contributions generated by the 2003 acquisitions, as well
as the Company’s successful operational excellence
strategy. This strategy includes the continued migration of
production to low-cost locales in Mexico, China and the Czech
Republic and the aggressive lowering of the Company’s
overall cost structure. Partially offsetting the increase in
segment operating income was the impact of lower sales by the
Company’s aerospace, power instruments, floor care and
specialty motors businesses. An $11.4 million increase in
pension costs, general business insurance and employee benefit
costs, net of benefits from certain insurance programs in 2003,
also lowered segment operating income.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were
$115.2 million in 2003, compared with $104.8 million
in 2002, an increase of $10.4 million or 9.9%. As a
percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 10.6% in 2003,
compared to 10.1% in 2002. The selling expense component, as a
percentage of sales, increased to 8.5% in 2003, compared to 8.3%
in 2002. Lower selling expenses of the Company’s base
businesses were more than offset by selling expense of the
businesses acquired in 2003. The businesses acquired in 2003
were differentiated businesses, which because of their
technology and higher marketing costs incur a higher percentage
of selling expenses than the Company’s base businesses. The
decrease in selling


expense by base businesses reflects the Company’s continual
focus on cost reduction initiatives as a part of its operational
excellence strategy.

Corporate administrative expenses were $22.4 million or
2.0% of sales in 2003, an increase of $3.3 million or
17.6%, when compared with 2002. The increase was primarily the
result of a one-time, noncash expense, in the third quarter of
2003, from the accelerated cost recognition due to the vesting
of a restricted stock grant. Higher net business insurance and
health insurance costs, as well as higher pension costs in 2003,
also contributed to the increase.

Consolidated operating income totaled $156.8 million or
14.4% of sales in 2003, compared to $148.7 million, or
14.3% of sales in 2002, an increase of $8.1 million or 5.4%.

Interest expense was $26.0 million in 2003, an increase of
3.3% compared with $25.2 million in 2002. The increase was
due to higher average debt levels to fund the 2003 acquisitions,
partially offset by lower interest rates.

The effective tax rate in 2003 was 32.5% compared with 31.9% in
2002. The higher tax rate in 2003 was primarily due to the
nondeductibility of the expense recognized in connection with
the vesting of the restricted stock grant mentioned above.

Net income in 2003 was $87.8 million, an increase of 4.9%
from $83.7 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share on a
post-stock split basis was $1.30, an increase of $0.06, when
compared with $1.24 per diluted share in 2002.

Operating Segment Results

Electronic Instruments Group

(EIG) sales were
$561.9 million in 2003, an increase of 4.2% from 2002 sales
of $539.4 million. The sales increase was primarily from
the 2003 Solidstate Controls, Inc. (SCI) and Chandler
acquisitions, as well as strength in the Group’s high-end
analytical businesses. A favorable foreign currency translation
impact of $6.8 million also benefited the sales of this
Group. Conditions remained weak in many of EIG’s markets,
especially in the aerospace and power instruments markets.
EIG’s base business sales were 4.7% lower, including the
favorable foreign currency impacts, when compared with 2002.

EIG’s operating income in 2003 increased to
$95.0 million from $87.5 million in 2002, an increase
of $7.5 million, or 8.6%. The increase was primarily driven
by the SCI and Chandler acquisitions, partially offset by a net
increase of $8.1 million in pension costs and insurance
expenses, as well as lower aerospace and power instruments
operating income due to their lower sales. The Group’s
operating margins in 2003 improved to 16.9% compared with
margins of 16.2% in 2002. The higher margins in 2003 were due to
the acquired businesses and the favorable effects of cost
reduction initiatives.

In September 2003, the Group’s Haveg business unit
experienced a flood at its manufacturing facility in Wilmington,
Delaware. This event did not have a significant impact on the
Company’s results of operations in 2003.

Electromechanical Group

(EMG) sales in 2003 were
$529.7 million, an increase of $28.6 million or 5.7%,
compared with sales of $501.1 million in 2002. The sales
increase was a result of the Airtechnology acquisition and
$17.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation
effects, partially offset by a decline in the floor care and
specialty motors businesses. EMG’s sales by base businesses
were 3.5% lower, including the favorable foreign currency
impacts, when compared with 2002.

EMG’s operating income in 2003 increased to
$84.2 million from $80.2 million in 2002, an increase
of $4.0 million or 4.9%. The increase was a result of the
Airtechnology acquisition, partially offset by lower sales by
the Group’s base businesses and higher benefit costs. The
Group’s operating margins in 2003 were unchanged at 15.9%.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$161.3 million for 2004, compared with $154.9 million
in 2003, an increase of $6.4 million, or 4.1%. The increase
in operating cash flow was primarily the result of higher
earnings, partially offset by higher overall operating working
capital requirements mainly driven by the growth of the
Company’s business to meet the increased sales levels. In
2004, the Company received $10.1 million in gross operating
cash proceeds, directly related to a previously mentioned flood
loss. The insurance proceeds were from the settlement of the
flood insurance claim involving one of the Company’s
manufacturing facilities. Also in 2004, the Company made
contributions to its defined benefit pension plans which totaled
$6.1 million. The strong operating cash flow during 2004
allowed the Company to make two acquisitions in 2004 (see
further discussion below) with limited borrowings under the
Company’s debt agreements. Free cash flow (operating cash
flow less capital spending) was $140.3 million in 2004,
compared with $133.6 million in 2003, an increase of 5.0%.
EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization) was $233.4 million in 2004, compared with
$191.1 million in 2003, a 22.1% improvement. Free cash flow
and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they
are measures that are used by third parties in evaluating the
Company. (See table on page 14 for a reconciliation of
comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures).

Cash used for investing activities was $154.5 million for
2004, compared with $181.0 million for 2003. The
Company’s acquisitions of Taylor Hobson in June 2004 and
Hughes-Treitler in July 2004 used $143.5 million of cash.
In 2003, the Company acquired Airtechnology Holdings Limited,
Solidstate Controls, Inc. and Chandler Instruments for
$163.9 million in cash. Additions to property, plant and
equipment totaled $21.0 million in 2004, compared with
$21.3 million in 2003. Gross proceeds from the flood
insurance claim discussed above related to property, plant and
equipment totaled $9.6 million in 2004.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $15.5 million
in 2004, compared with cash provided of $26.9 million in
2003. The net increase in 2004 came from net borrowings of
$15.5 million, compared with net borrowings of
$24.0 million in 2003. Long-term borrowings had a net
increase of $71.1 million and includes a 40 million
British pound ($76.7 million) twelve-year term loan to
finance the acquisition of Taylor Hobson. The British pound loan
provides a natural hedge of the Company’s investment in
Taylor Hobson, which is based in the United Kingdom. The Company
had available borrowing capacity of $271.5 million under
its $300 million revolving bank credit facility, and
$37.0 million under its $75.0 million accounts
receivable securitization agreement at December 31, 2004.
The revolving bank credit facility was amended on
February 25, 2004 to extend its expiration date from
September 2006 to February 2009. Extension of the credit
facility provides the Company with increased flexibility to
support its growth plans.

At December 31, 2004, total debt outstanding was
$450.1 million compared with $424.4 million at
December 31, 2003. The debt-to-capital ratio improved to
40.6%, from 44.5% at December 31, 2003. The Company’s
debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations
on indebtedness, dividend payments and maintenance of certain
financial ratios. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company was well within the allowable limits of the financial
ratios.

In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
a 100% increase in its quarterly cash dividend effective with
the March 2004 dividend payment. Cash dividends paid in 2004
were $16.3 million, compared to $8.1 million in 2003.

There were no repurchases of the Company’s common stock in
2004. In 2003, the Company purchased 380,000 shares of its
common stock for $5.8 million. As of December 31,
2004, $52.4 million was available, under the current Board
authorization for future share repurchases.


The following table summarizes AMETEK’s contractual cash
obligations at December 31, 2004 and the effect such
obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity
and cash flows in future years.

(a)

The 5.96% Senior Note is a seven-year 50 million
    British pound loan, which is subject to foreign currency
    fluctuation. The loan was obtained in conjunction with the
    Company’s investment in Airtechnology, a United
    Kingdom-based business, which was acquired in January 2003. The
    5.99% Senior Note is a twelve-year 40 million British
    pound loan, which is subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
    The loan was obtained in conjunction with the Company’s
    purchase of Taylor Hobson, a United Kingdom-based business,
    which was acquired in June 2004.

(b)

Amount includes $38.0 million under the accounts receivable
    securitization program, which is classified as short-term
    borrowings at December 31, 2004.

(c)

Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual
    commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

Other Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of
approximately $33.5 million related to performance and
payment guarantees. Based on experience with these arrangements,
the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will
not be material to its financial position.

Although it has not done so in recent years, the Company may,
from time to time, redeem, tender for, or repurchase its
long-term debt in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions depending upon availability, market conditions and
other factors.

As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in
2004, cash and cash equivalents increased to $37.6 million
at December 31, 2004, compared with $14.3 million at
December 31, 2003. The Company believes it has sufficient
cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted
foreign sources, and available financing alternatives to enable
it to meet its operating needs and contractual commitments.

Transactions with Related Parties

A member of the Company’s Board of Directors is also a
member of the law firm of Stroock & Stroock &
Lavan LLP, with which the Company has a business relationship.
In 2004, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP billed
fees to the Company in the aggregate for services rendered of
$538,000.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its most critical accounting policies
as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact
on the presentation of the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations, and that require the use of complex
and subjective estimates based upon past experience and
management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent
in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the
estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and
related notes contain information that is pertinent to the
Company’s accounting policies and to management’s
discussion and analysis. The information that follows


represents additional specific disclosures about the
Company’s accounting policies regarding risks, estimates,
subjective decisions, or assessments whereby materially
different results of operations and financial condition could
have been reported had different assumptions been used or
different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the
Company’s significant accounting policies is in Note 1
of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,”
included elsewhere in this report.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenues in
    accordance with invoice terms, generally when products are
    shipped and services are rendered. The policy with respect to
    sales returns and allowances generally provides that the
    customer may not return products or be given allowances, except
    at the Company’s option. Accruals for sales returns, other
    allowances, and estimated warranty costs are provided at the
    time of shipment based upon past experience. At
    December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the accrual for future
    warranty obligations was $7.3 million, $6.9 million
    and $6.4 million, respectively. The Company’s expense
    for warranty obligations approximated $5.0 million in each
    of the last three years. The warranty periods for products sold
    vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the
    most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
    warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and
    adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
    expenses. If actual future sales returns, allowances and
    warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional
    warranty accruals may be required.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the last-in, first-out
    (LIFO) method of accounting for more than half of its
    inventories, whereby inventories reported on its balance sheet
    are conservatively valued. If the Company had used the first-in,
    first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which
    approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have
    been approximately $28.8 million and $26.8 million
    higher than the amount reported in the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company
    provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and
    obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future
    demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing
    financial difficulties, and related management initiatives. If
    these factors are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill.

The Company accounts for goodwill under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”.
    Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is not amortized; rather,
    it is tested for impairment at least annually. As required by
    SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortization of all
    goodwill as of January 1, 2002.

SFAS No. 142 requires a two-step impairment test for
    goodwill. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of
    the reporting unit’s assets to the fair value of the
    reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no
    further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is
    recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then
    the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the
    fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability,
    with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss
    occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the
    implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record such
    impairment losses. The determination of the fair value of the
    Company’s reporting units is based, among other things, on
    estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit
    being valued. Changes in interest rates and market conditions,
    among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. The
    Company’s acquisitions have generally included a large
    goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make
    acquisitions. At December 31, 2004, goodwill totaled
    $601.0 million or 42.3% of the Company’s total assets.
    The Company performed its required annual impairment test in the
    fourth quarter of 2004 and determined that the Company’s
    goodwill was not impaired. There can be no assurance that
    goodwill impairment will not occur in the future.

•

Pensions

U.S. Defined Benefit Plans

The Company has defined benefit and defined contribution pension
    plans. AMETEK accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in
    accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
    Accounting for


Pensions”, which requires that amounts recognized in the
    financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. The
    most significant elements in determining the Company’s
    pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability
    discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The
    pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at
    which the pension liabilities could be settled at the year-end
    valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines
    the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan
    liabilities. In estimating this rate, the Company looks to rates
    of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments. The
    discount rate used in determining the 2004 pension cost was
    6.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The discount
    rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at
    December 31, 2004, and determining the 2005
    U.S. defined benefit pension plan cost is 5.75%. The
    Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    for U.S. defined benefit pension plans for 2004 of 8.9%,
    and will use a rate of 8.5% for 2005. The rate of compensation
    increase used in determining the 2004 and 2005 pension expense
    for these plans was 3.5%. The unrecognized pension loss, which
    results from the net effect of changes in the assumed discount
    rate, the effect of differences between the expected return and
    the actual return on plan assets, and other changes in actuarial
    assumptions, has been deferred and is subject to amortization
    over the estimated service periods of the participants. The
    unrecognized pension loss totaled $67.2 million for
    U.S. defined benefit pension plans at December 31,
    2004, compared with $62.2 million at December 31,
    2003. Based on future actuarial assumptions, this deferred loss
    could possibly affect future pension costs.

U.S. and Foreign Defined Benefit Plans

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
    recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of
    $2.6 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit
    pension plans, which includes approximately $0.3 million in
    curtailment costs. This compares with pretax pension expense of
    $7.4 million recognized from these plans in 2003. The
    Company made cash contributions to certain of its defined
    benefit pension plans during 2004 which totaled
    $6.1 million, compared with $5.2 million in 2003.
    Based on the current economic outlook, the Company anticipates
    making cash contributions of approximately $6.0 million to
    its defined benefit pension plans in 2005.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains allowances for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific
    customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A
    specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount
    due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company
    recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time
    specific receivables are past due based on its historical
    experience. If the financial condition of the Company’s
    customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to
    make payments, additional allowances may be required. The
    allowance for possible losses on receivables at
    December 31, 2004 was $7.6 million, compared with
    $7.9 million at December 31, 2003.

New Accounting Standards

In the first quarter of 2004, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Financial
Interpretation No. 46-R (“FIN 46-R”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51”, which replaced FIN 46.
FIN 46-R requires a company to consolidate a variable
interest entity (“VIE”) if it is designated as a
primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not
have a majority voting interest in the entity. A VIE is
generally defined as an entity in which equity investors do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or
do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance
its own activities without additional financial support from
other parties, or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of
ownership. The disclosure requirements of FIN 46-R were
effective for financial statements issued after
December 31, 2003. The initial recognition provisions of
FIN 46-R relating to VIE’s created or obtained prior
to February 2003 were to be implemented no later than the end of
the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004.
Adoption of FIN 46-R had no effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows.


In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment,” a revision to
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation” and superseding Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” SFAS No. 123(R) will
require the Company to expense the fair value of grants made
under its employee stock option plans. That cost will be
recognized over the vesting period of the grants.
SFAS No. 123(R) is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period after June  15, 2005.
SFAS No. 123(R) permits companies to adopt its
requirements using either a “modified prospective”
method, or a “modified retrospective” method. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amounts previously
disclosed under SFAS No. 123 will be recorded in the
consolidated statement of income. As more fully described in
Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company currently
accounts for share-based payments to employees using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25.
The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be
completely predicted at this time because it will depend on,
among other things, the level of share-based payments granted in
the future. The Company is still assessing the effect of
adopting SFAS No. 123(R) and the appropriate
transition method. Also, the Company has not determined whether
the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in amounts
that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under
SFAS No, 123 (See Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated
financial statements).

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in
ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,”
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). Among
other provisions, the new rule requires that such items be
recognized as current-period charges. SFAS No. 151 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
The Company is still evaluating the effects of adopting SFAS
No. 151.

Internal Reinvestment

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $21.0 million for 2004, compared
with $21.3 million for 2003. Approximately 55% of the
expenditures in 2004 were for equipment to increase productivity
and expand capacity. The Company’s 2005 capital
expenditures are expected to increase when compared with 2004
levels, with a continuing emphasis on spending to improve
productivity and expand low-cost manufacturing facilities. The
Company expects 2005 capital expenditures to increase from the
2004 level with continued emphasis on increases in productivity
and capacity expansion. For 2005 capital expenditures are
expected to approximate a range of 2% to


/


%
of sales.

Product Development and Engineering

Product development and engineering expenses are directed toward
the development and improvement of new and existing products and
processes. Such expenses before customer reimbursement were
$66.0 million in 2004, an increase from $56.1 million
in 2003, and $46.8 million in 2002. Customer reimbursements
in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $6.2 million, $6.2 million
and $8.0 million, respectively. Included in the amounts
above are net expenses for research and development of
$25.5 million for 2004, $21.4 million for 2003, and
$23.7 million for 2002.

Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
existing at that time, the Company has been named a Potentially
Responsible Party (PRP) regarding waste remediation at
several non-AMETEK sites that are the subject of
government-mandated cleanups. In addition to these non-AMETEK
sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves
for probable remediation activities at certain of its
manufacturing locations and for claims and proceedings against
the Company with respect to other environmental matters once the
Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable.
Total environmental reserves at December 31,


2004 and 2003 were approximately $7.3 million and
$6.4 million, respectively. In 2004, the Company spent
approximately $1.0 million on such environmental matters,
compared with approximately $1.1 million in 2003. The
Company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its
acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned
businesses. Under certain of the agreements the former or new
owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company
against, certain environmental and other liabilities under
certain circumstances. The Company and some of the other parties
carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To
date, those parties have met their obligations in all material
respects. The Company has no reason to believe that such third
parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future.
However, if the Company were required to record a liability with
respect to all, or a portion of, such matters on its balance
sheet, the effect on income and the amount of the liability
would not be significant. In the opinion of management, based
upon presently available information and past experience related
to such matters, either adequate provision for probable costs
has been made, or the ultimate cost resulting from these actions
is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Market Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are
fluctuations in interest rates on its short-term and long-term
debt, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for
certain raw material purchases.

All of the Company’s long-term debt carries fixed rates and
its short-term debt is variable-rate debt. These financial
instruments are more fully described in the notes to the
financial statements.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most
significant exchange rate exposure include the euro, the British
pound, the Mexican peso and the Japanese yen. Exposure to
foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when
possible, mitigated through the occasional use of derivative
financial instruments, and use of local borrowings in the
foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign
subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is
included in other comprehensive income, within
stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transactions have
not had a significant effect on the operating results reported
by the Company.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure
are raw material purchases of nickel, copper and steel. Exposure
to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated
through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product,
and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward
contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest
rates, commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, the
potential losses in future earnings, fair value of
risk-sensitive financial instruments, and cash flows are not
material, although the actual effects may differ materially from
the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are
“forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995, which
involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Company’s
operations and business environment, and are subject to change
based on various important factors. The Company wishes to take
advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA
by cautioning readers that numerous important factors discussed
below, among others, in some cases have caused, and in the
future could cause, the Company’s actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. The following
include some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ from projections:

•

An economic slowdown, or unforeseen price reductions in the
    Company’s global market segments, could have adverse
    effects on profit margins.

•

The Company’s inability to continue achieving its cost

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
the consolidated financial statements and related information.
The statements are prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently
applied and include certain amounts based on management’s
best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
financial information, management maintains a system of internal
accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
division of responsibility and the application of written
policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
of internal controls, although there are inherent limitations in
the effectiveness of any system of internal controls that is
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and
reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated
financial statements.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Company’s activities according to the highest standards of
personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
of the Company for its 2005 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have
direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, are engaged to render an
opinion as to whether management’s financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s
financial position and results of operations. That report is
included on page 31.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on the
framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2004.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears on page 30.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying

Report of Management —
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

, that AMETEK, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
AMETEK, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that AMETEK, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 4, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
(the “Company”), and include the accounts of the
Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant
intercompany transactions in the consolidation. The
Company’s investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures
are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Such
investments are not significant.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents, Securities, and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, all of the Company’s
equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those
of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as
“available-for-sale”, although the Company may hold
fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income
securities generally mature within four years. The aggregate
market value of equity and fixed income securities at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was: 2004 —
$18.7 million ($16.8 million amortized cost) and
2003 — $14.8 million ($13.4 million
amortized cost). The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such
securities is recorded as a separate component of other
comprehensive income (in stockholders’ equity), and is not
material. The Company had no other-than-temporary impairment
losses in 2004. The Company recognized other-than-temporary
impairment losses against earnings of $0.7 million in 2003
and $0.3 million in 2002. Certain of the Company’s
other investments are accounted for by the equity method.

Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
receivables is recorded against the amounts due from these
customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
specific receivables are past due based on its past experience.
The allowance for possible losses on receivables at
December 31, 2004 was $7.6 million, compared with
$7.9 million at December 31, 2003. See Note 5.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined for more than half of inventories by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory valuation, and
market on the basis of the lower of replacement cost or
estimated net proceeds from sales. The excess of the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) value over the LIFO value at December 31,
2004 and 2003 was $28.8 million and $26.8 million,
respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs, and dies,
and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets.


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company generally recognizes revenue when products are
shipped and services are rendered. The policy with respect to
sales returns and allowances generally provides that a customer
may not return products, or be given allowances, except at the
Company’s option. Accruals for sales returns, other
allowances, and estimated warranty costs are provided at the
time of shipment based upon past experience, and are adjusted
periodically to reflect actual expenses. The warranty periods
for products sold vary widely among the Company’s
operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The
Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past
warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to
reflect actual warranty expenses. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the accrual for future warranty obligations was
$7.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively.

Research and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
operations as incurred and during the past three years were:
2004 — $25.5 million, 2003 —
$21.4 million, and 2002 — $23.7 million.

Earnings Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the
effect of all potentially dilutive securities (primarily
outstanding common stock options). The following table presents
the number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings
per share and diluted earnings per share:




Weighted average shares (in thousands):

67,254

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and
their results of operations are translated using average
exchange rates for the year.

Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are
made in currencies other than their functional currency.
Exchange gains and losses from those transactions generally are
included in operating results for the year. Where those
transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the
gains and losses on those transactions are deferred in other
comprehensive income (within stockholders’ equity) to the
extent they are effective as hedges.

Stock-Based Compensation

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

and SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosures

, which amends SFAS 123, encourage entities
to recognize compensation expense for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value, but provide the option of
measuring compensation expense using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25).
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
with APB 25. The exercise price of stock options, set at
the time of the grant, is not less than the fair market value
per share at the date of the grant. Had the Company applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, pretax
stock-based compensation expense would have increased
$5.1 million, $4.9 million, and $4.5 million for
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Diluted earnings per share


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

would have been lower by $0.04 for 2004 and 2003, and $0.03 for
2002. Options generally have a four year full vesting period
from the date of grant. Note 9 presents pro forma results
of operations as if SFAS 123 had been used to account for
stock-based compensation plans.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange, and
forward contract exposure. The Company does not hold or trade in
derivatives for speculative purposes. On the date a derivative
contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative
as either (1) a fair value hedge, (2) a cash flow
hedge, or (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation. Interest rate swap and cap agreements are accounted
for as cash flow hedges, and are sometimes used to manage the
interest rate characteristics of certain outstanding revolving
credit loans to a more desirable fixed or variable rate basis,
or to limit the Company’s exposure to rising interest
rates. These swaps and caps are matched with the underlying
fixed or variable rate debt, and any periodic cash payments are
accrued on a settlement basis and accounted for as adjustments
to interest costs. There were no interest rate swap or cap
agreements in place at, or during the years ended,
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Qualifying
derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments are
accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item is
an investment in a foreign subsidiary. Foreign currency forward
contracts are entered into from time to time to hedge specific
firm commitments for certain inventory purchases or export
sales, thereby minimizing the Company’s exposure to foreign
currency fluctuation. When present, all derivative financial
instruments are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”. There was one forward
contract outstanding at December 31, 2004, which was
acquired with one of the 2003 acquisitions, for the purchase of
certain inventories. The amount of the forward contract and the
gain recognized in earnings on the underlying transactions were
not material to the Company. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
the Company had $172.7 million and $89.3 million,
respectively, of British-pound-denominated loans, which are
designated as a hedge against the net investment in foreign
subsidiaries acquired in 2004 and 2003. As a result of these
British Pound denominated loans being designated, and effective
as net investment hedges, approximately $10.1 million and
$9.4 million of currency losses have been included in the
translation adjustment in other comprehensive income at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142,
purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
are not amortized, rather, they are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company ceased the
amortization of goodwill in accordance with
SFAS No. 142. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, goodwill by segment was: Electronic Instrument
Group (EIG) — $366.6 million and
$309.0 million; Electromechanical Group (EMG) —
$234.4 million and $197.9 million. The net increase in
goodwill in 2004 is primarily due to the acquisitions of Taylor
Hobson and Hughes-Treitler.

In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives for impairment under SFAS No. 142, a
determination of the fair value of the Company’s reporting
units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required
and is based upon, among other things, estimates of future
operating performance of the reporting unit being valued.
Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an
impact on these estimates. The Company completed its required
annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2004 and
determined that there was no impairment.

Reclassifications

Stock Split

On January 27, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one split of its common stock distributed on
February 27, 2004, to shareholders of record on
February 13, 2004. All share and per share amounts included
in this report reflect the stock split.

3.

Accounting Pronouncements

In the first quarter of 2004, the Company adopted FASB Financial
Interpretation No. 46-R (“FIN 46-R”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51”, which replaced FIN 46.
FIN 46-R requires a company to consolidate a variable
interest entity (“VIE”) if it is designated as a
primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not
have a majority voting interest in the entity. A VIE is
generally defined as an entity in which equity investors do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or
do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance
its own activities without additional financial support from
other parties, or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of
ownership. The disclosure requirements of FIN 46-R were
effective for financial statements issued after
December 31, 2003. The initial recognition provisions of
FIN 46-R relating to VIE’s created or obtained prior
to February 2003 were to be implemented no later than the end of
the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004.
Adoption of FIN 46-R had no effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment,” a revision to
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation” and superseding Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” SFAS No. 123(R) will
require the Company to expense the fair value of grants made
under its employee stock option plans. That cost will be
recognized over the vesting period of the grants.
SFAS No. 123(R) is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period after June 15, 2005.
SFAS No. 123(R) permits companies to adopt its
requirements using either a “modified prospective”
method, or a “modified retrospective” method. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amounts previously
disclosed under SFAS No. 123 will be recorded in the
consolidated statement of income. As more fully described in
Note 1, the Company currently accounts for share-based
payments to employees using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25. The impact of adopting
SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be completely predicted at this
time because it will depend on, among other things, the level of
share-based payments granted in the future. The Company is still
assessing the effect of adopting SFAS 123(R) and the
appropriate transition method. Also, the Company has not
determined whether the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma
disclosures under SFAS No, 123 (See Notes 1 and 9).

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in
ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,”
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). Among
other provisions, the new rule requires that such items be
recognized as current-period charges. SFAS No. 151 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
The Company is still evaluating the effects of adopting SFAS
No. 151.

Acquisitions

In 2004, the Company made two acquisitions. In June 2004, the
Company acquired Taylor Hobson Holdings Limited (Taylor Hobson)
for approximately 51.0 million British pounds, or
$93.8 million in cash,


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

net of cash received. Taylor Hobson is a leading manufacturer of
ultraprecise measurement instrumentation for a variety of
markets, including optics, semiconductors, hard disk drives and
nanotechnology research. Taylor Hobson is a part of the
Company’s Electronic Instruments Group. In July 2004, the
Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Hughes-Treitler Mfg. Corp. (Hughes-Treitler) for approximately
$48.0 million in cash. Hughes-Treitler is a supplier of
heat exchangers and thermal management subsystems for the
aerospace and defense markets. Hughes-Treitler is a part of the
Company’s Electromechanical Group. The aggregate purchase
price paid for the 2004 acquisitions is subject to adjustment
upon finalization of the value of the net assets acquired.

The operating results of the above acquisitions are included in
the Company’s consolidated results from their respective
dates of acquisition.

The acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
method in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations.” The following table presents the preliminary
allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the 2004
acquisitions based on their estimated fair values:

In millions

Goodwill

95.1

Other assets

37.5

Other long-term liabilities

(13.0

)

Total net assets

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefit
the Company expects to realize from expanding its measurement
instruments capabilities into ultraprecise applications through
Taylor Hobson and its thermal management systems offerings for
the aerospace market through Hughes-Treitler.

The $37.5 million in other assets was assigned to
intangibles, other than goodwill, primarily technology and
patents; with estimated lives up to 20 years.

The Company is in the process of completing third party
valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired
with the new businesses. Therefore, the allocation of purchase
price to these acquisitions is subject to revision.

In 2003, the Company made three acquisitions. In January 2003,
the Company acquired Airtechnology Holdings Limited
(Airtechnology) from Candover Partners Limited, for
approximately 50 million British pounds, or about
$80 million in cash. Airtechnology is a supplier of motors,
fans and environmental control systems for the aerospace and
defense markets. Airtechnology is a part of the Company’s
Electromechanical Group. In February 2003, the Company acquired
Solidstate Controls, Inc. (SCI) from Marmon Industrial Companies
LLC for approximately $34 million in cash. SCI is a leading
supplier of uninterruptible power supply systems for the process
and power generation industries. SCI is a part of the
Company’s Electronic Instruments Group. In August 2003, the
Company acquired Chandler Instruments Company, LLC. (Chandler
Instruments) for approximately $49 million in cash.
Chandler Instruments is a leading manufacturer of high-quality
measurement instrumentation for the oil and gas industry.
Chandler Instruments is a part of the Company’s Electronic
Instruments Group.

Had the acquisitions of Taylor Hobson and Hughes-Treitler been
made at the beginning of 2004, unaudited pro forma net sales,
net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 2004 would not have been materially different
than the amounts reported. Had these acquisitions, along with
the 2003 Chandler acquisition, been made at the beginning of
2003, unaudited pro forma net sales for the year

Flood Damage Gain

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company settled an insurance
claim in connection with a flood loss, which occurred at one of
its manufacturing plants in the third quarter of 2003. The flood
caused significant damage to the building, and the plant’s
operating assets. Since the occurrence of the flood, the Company
received insurance proceeds totaling $24.2 million in
settlement of the damage claim and loss of these assets. Gross
cash proceeds totaling $19.7 million, were received in
2004. Proceeds of $4.5 million were received in 2003. The
portion of the claim relating to the building, its contents, and
the operating assets was finalized with the Company’s
insurers in the third quarter of 2004 resulting in the
recognition of a pretax gain of $2.8 million in that
quarter. The remaining portion of the insurance claim, which
related primarily to business interruption and other expenses
was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2004, resulting in the
recognition of an additional $2.5 million pretax gain. The
total pretax gain recognized in 2004 from this insurance claim
was $5.3 million and is included in operating income in the
consolidated statement of income. As a result of the flood, the
Company has decided to cease operations at this location. Plant
closure costs of $3.6 million associated with this decision
were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004, and have been
reflected in the determination of the gain.

In November 2004, the Company issued 40 million British
pound ($76.7 million at December 31, 2004) 5.99%
senior note due in 2016. In September 2003, the Company issued
50 million British pound ($96.0 million at
December 31, 2004) 5.96% senior note due in 2010.

The Company has an unsecured $300 million Revolving Credit
Facility that matures on February 25, 2009. Interest rates
on outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are
either at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a
negotiated spread over LIBOR, or at the U.S. prime rate. At
December 31, 2004, the Company had no revolving credit
loans outstanding. At December 31, 2004,
$271.5 million was unused and available under the Revolving
Credit Facility. The Company had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $28.5 million at December 31, 2004.

The Revolving Credit Facility places certain restrictions on
allowable foreign debt, and the measurement of the pro forma
effect of potential acquisitions in certain debt covenant
compliance calculations. The Revolving Credit Facility also
places certain restrictions on certain cash payments, including
the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2004, retained
earnings of approximately $27.2 million were not subject to
the dividend limitation.

The Company’s accounts receivable financing agreement with
a bank provides for borrowings of up to $75.0 million
against its trade accounts receivable. At December 31, 2004
and 2003, $38.0 million and $64.0 million,
respectively, was used under this secured credit facility. The
weighted average interest rate on the amount outstanding under
the accounts receivable securitization during December 31,
2004 and 2003 was 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
facilities with local foreign lenders of approximately
$44.7 million. Foreign debt outstanding at
December 31, 2004 was $13.5 million including
$2.4 million reported in long-term debt.

The approximate weighted average interest rate, during the year,
on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was
6.2% and 5.6%, respectively.

Stockholders’ Equity

In March 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
a $50 million share repurchase program, adding to the
remaining authorization under the 1998 share repurchase
program. In 2004, the Company did not repurchase any shares of
its common stock under its current share repurchase
authorization, compared with repurchases of 380,000 shares
at a total cost of $5.8 million in 2003. At
December 31, 2004, approximately $52.4 million of the
current share purchase authorization was unexpended. At
December 31, 2004, the Company held approximately
1.7 million shares in its treasury at a cost of
$24.5 million compared with approximately 2.1 million
shares at a cost of $29.6 million at the end of 2003. The
number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2004 was
68.7 million shares, compared with 67.0 million shares
at December 31, 2003.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of
one-half of a Right for each share of Company common stock owned
at the inception of the Plan. The Plan provides, under certain
conditions involving acquisition of the Company’s common
stock, that holders of Rights, except for the acquiring entity,
would be entitled (i) to purchase shares of preferred stock
at a specified exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares
of common stock of the Company, or the acquiring company, having
a value of twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the
Plan expire in 2007.

9.

Stock Option and Award Plans

The Company’s 2002 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant
of up to 4.0 million shares of common stock to eligible
employees and non-employee directors of the Company in the form
of options, phantom stock awards, restricted stock awards and
stock rights. The Company’s 1999 Stock Incentive Plan
permits the grant of up to 4.0 million shares of common
stock in the same form as those under the 2002 Plan. The
Company’s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of up
to 7.6 million shares of common stock in the same form as
those under the 2002 Plan. Stock options may be granted as
non-qualified stock options or as incentive stock options.

Beginning in 2004, the Company adopted a change in its long-term
incentive compensation program for officers and other senior
managers to grant approximately 50% of the value of its
long-term incentive awards as restricted stock and 50% as stock
options, rather than primarily stock options as it had
previously. Restricted awards of the Company’s common stock
are made to eligible employees and non-employee directors at
such cost to the grantee as the stock option committee of the
Board of Directors may determine. Such shares are granted
subject to certain conditions with respect to transfer and other
restrictions as prescribed by the plan. Upon grant of restricted
stock, unearned compensation, equivalent to the excess of the
market price of the shares awarded over the price paid by the
grantee at the date of grant, is charged as a reduction of
capital in excess of par value in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense over the
periods until the restrictions lapse. In 2004,
367,625 shares of restricted stock were granted at an
average market value of $27.96 per restricted share.
Compensation expense related to restricted stock amortization
was $1.1 million, $2.4 million, and $0.6 million
in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Restricted stock
compensation expense in 2003 included $2.1 million in
connection with the acceleration of vesting of a restricted
stock grant. There were 364,945 shares of restricted stock
outstanding at December 31, 2004. No restricted stock
awards were granted in 2003 and 2002. Under the terms of the
existing Stock Incentive Plans, at December 31, 2004,
349,807 additional shares of restricted stock may be granted.

In 2004, the Company reserved 16,793 shares of common
stock, and there were reductions for retirements and
terminations which totaled 15,410 shares, under a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”),
bringing the total number of shares reserved to
173,863 shares of common stock as of December 31,
2004. Charges to expense under the SERP, not significant in
amount, are considered pension expense (see Note 12), with
the offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par
value.

At December 31, 2004, 6,919,840 (8,615,898 in 2003) shares
of common stock were reserved for issuance, including stock
options outstanding, under the 2002, 1999 and 1997 plans. The
options are exercisable at prices not less than market prices on
dates of grant, and in installments over four- to ten-year
periods from dates of grant. Options vest on a straight-line
basis generally over a four-year period. The Company had no
stock appreciation rights outstanding at December 31, 2004

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”, in accounting for its stock option awards,
which recognizes expense based on the intrinsic value of the
award at the date of grant. Since stock options have been issued
with the exercise price per share equal to the fair market value
per share at the date of grant, no compensation expense has
resulted related to these types of awards. Had the Company
accounted for stock awards in accordance with the fair value

$53.7 million, consisting of annual payments of
$9.0 million in 2005, $7.4 million in 2006,
$5.3 million in 2007, $4.5 million in 2008,

In 2004, U.S. deferred income taxes totaling
$1.6 million were provided on undistributed earnings of
certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not expected to be
permanently reinvested in such companies. There has been no
provision for U.S. deferred income taxes for the
undistributed earnings of certain other subsidiaries, which
total approximately $23.5 million at December 31,
2004, because the Company intends to reinvest these earnings
indefinitely in operations outside the United States. Upon
distribution of those earnings to the United States, the Company
would be subject to U.S. income taxes based on the excess
of the U.S. statutory rate over statutory rates in the
foreign jurisdiction and withholding taxes payable to the
various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the
unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these
undistributed earnings is not practicable.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $12.7 million for tax
purposes, which were primarily related to recent acquisitions.
The net operating loss carryforwards will be available to offset
future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will
expire between 2005 and 2018. The Company maintains a 100%
valuation allowance to offset the deferred tax assets resulting
from these benefits based on the likelihood of realization. Any
reductions in the valuation allowance resulting from the
realization of the loss carryforwards of acquired companies will
result in a reduction of the acquired goodwill.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act
(“AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Company may elect to
apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in
2005. The Company has started an evaluation of the effects of
the repatriation provision of AJCA; however, the Company is
unable to complete this evaluation until Congress or the
Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on
key elements of the provision. The Company expects to complete
its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision
within a reasonable period of time following the publication of
the additional clarifying language. The range of possible
amounts that the Company is reviewing for possible repatriation
under this provision is between zero and $23.5 million (see
above discussion of undistributed earnings). The related
potential range of income tax liability is between zero and
$0.9 million. Beginning in 2005, the AJCA provides for a
deduction for a portion of income attributable to
U.S. production activities. In addition, there is a
phased-in elimination of the tax benefit related to qualified
export sales. The Company is in the process of determining the
potential tax effect that could result from these aspects of the
new tax law.

Retirement Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits

Retirement and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of
service and/or compensation. The following is a brief
description of the Company’s retirement and pension plans.


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans. As a result of the acquisition of United
Kingdom based Airtechnology in 2003 and Taylor Hobson in 2004,
the Company obtained two foreign defined benefit pension plans,
which are similar to the Company’s U.S. defined
benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined
benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. Based on current
economic conditions, AMETEK estimates that it will make cash
contributions of approximately $6 million to its
worldwide-defined benefit pension plans in 2005.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its
U.S. defined benefit pension plans and an October 1,
measurement date for its foreign defined benefit pension plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for
eligible employees. Participants in the savings plan may
contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a
dollar-for-dollar basis up to 6% of eligible compensation or a
maximum of $1,200 per participant.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined
contribution retirement feature principally to cover
U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after
December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s
salary. Employees of certain of the Company’s foreign
operations participate in various local defined contribution
plans.

The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
certain of its U.S. acquired businesses for the benefit of
eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed 6% of
the participant’s base compensation.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
arrangements and/or a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(SERP) covering certain current and former executives of
the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to
compensate the employee for retirement benefits that would have
been provided under the Company’s primary retirement plan,
except for statutory limitations on compensation that may be
taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit
obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be
funded by a grant of shares of the Company’s common stock
upon retirement or termination of the executives. The Company is
providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the
applicable periods.

The following tables set forth the changes in benefit
obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the funded and
unfunded defined benefit plans for 2004 and 2003:


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) at the end
of 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following:

On an ABO basis, in the aggregate, the Company’s funded
U.S. defined benefit pension plans were 102% funded at
December 31, 2004 and 2003. Foreign defined benefit pension
plans were 91% and 81% funded at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. For a presentation of the plans whose ABO

AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of plan assets for these plans was
$341.5 million and $318.2 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The expected long-term rate of
return on these plan assets was 8.90% in 2004 and 2003. Equity
securities included 662,800 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common
stock in the amount of $23.6 million (6.9% of total plan
investment assets) and 1,142,800 shares in the amount of
$27.6 million (8.7% of total plan investment assets) at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit
plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the Plans’
funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
established. Since there may be periods of time where both
equity and fixed income markets provide poor returns, an
allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
overall portfolio’s diversification and return potential.
The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation taking
into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
established targets and ranges, and rebalanced when necessary.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
component.

The objective of the fixed income portion of the pension assets
is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, which is
described in note (a) on page 50, certain investments
are prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital,
private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin
trading, commodities, limited partnerships, short selling, and
rights and warrants. Swaps, options, forwards and futures may be
used to avoid market exposure, and to manage foreign currency
exposure.

Foreign Defined Benefit Pension Plans

(a)

Primarily cash and cash equivalents.

The objectives of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit
plans’ investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
of the Plan. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
different asset classes, relative to the Plans’ liabilities
and how this can be affected by diversification, relative
returns available on equities, fixed income investments, real
estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those returns
and the cash flow requirements of the Plans’ are
considered. It is expected that equities will outperform fixed
interest investments over the long term. However, the trustees
recognize the fact that fixed income investments may better
match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the relatively
young active employee group covered by the plans, and the
immature nature of the plans, the Trustees have chosen to adopt
an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity
investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed
from time to time in view of changes in market conditions and in
the Plans’ liability profile.

The following table provides the components of net periodic
benefit expense (income) for the three years ended
December 31:

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine the above net
periodic expense (income) were:

Expected return on plan assets

Expected return on plan assets

7.20%

Rate of compensation increase (where applicable)

4.00%

4.25%

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
assets. This review also considered current capital market
conditions and expectations of projected future investment
returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
The current low interest rate environment also influences this
outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for
U.S. Plans is being reduced from 8.90% in 2004 to 8.5% for
2005. The expected return on assets for the foreign plans for
2005 remains unchanged from 2004 at 7.2%.

Postretirement Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
pensions for certain retirees and a small number of current and
former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not
funded and are not significant. In connection with the flood
loss and closure of the plant described in Note 6, in the
fourth quarter of 2004, the Company accelerated the recognition
of deferred actuarial losses under the affected postretirement
benefit plan resulting in a $1.0 million pre-tax charge
against earnings.

The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
invested in either, or a combination of, (a) an
interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
the general assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of
a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common
stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
plan, including income earned, was $5.4 million and
$4.3 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by
the Company and is not significant.

13.

Financial Instruments

As discussed in Note 1, the Company makes limited use of
derivative financial instruments, and does not use them for
trading purposes.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to reduce the
potential impact of increases in interest rates on the
Company’s borrowings. Accordingly, the Company may enter
into these agreements to effectively convert floating-rate loans
to fixed-rate loans and to cap certain interest rates that are
indexed to LIBOR rates to reduce the risk from rising interest
rates. During 2004 and 2003, the Company was not party to such
agreements.

Qualifying derivatives and nonderivative financial instruments
are accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item
is an investment in a foreign subsidiary. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the Company had $172.7 million and
$89.3 million, respectively, of British pound denominated
loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net
investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in 2004 and 2003. As
a result, approximately $10.1 million and $9.4 million
of currency losses have been included in the translation
adjustment in other comprehensive income during 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Forward currency contracts may be utilized from time to time to
hedge certain firm inventory purchases and export sales
commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of
such hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk
that the eventual net cash dollar outflows and inflows resulting
from the purchase of certain inventories or the sales to foreign
customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange
rates. The terms of the currency contracts are dependent on the
firm commitment. During 2004, and


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2003, the Company was party to one forward contract for the
purchase of certain inventories in connection with one of its
2003 acquisitions. The amounts involved are not material to the
Company.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments are compared below to the recorded amounts at
December 31, 2004 and 2003. Cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities are recorded at fair value at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the accompanying balance
sheet.

The fair value of fixed-income investments is based on quoted

on the carrying value at year-end. The fair value of the
Company’s long-term debt, which consists primarily of
publicly traded notes, is based on the quoted market price for
such notes and borrowing rates currently available to the
Company for loans with similar terms and maturities.

Additional Income Statement and Cash Flow Information

Included in other income are interest and other investment
income of $2.0 million, $1.0 million, and
$0.9 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Income
taxes paid in 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $45.7 million,
$25.1 million, and $26.9 million, respectively. Cash
paid for interest was $27.0 million, $24.1 million,
and $24.0 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Business Segment and Geographic Information

Descriptive Information About Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, the Electronic
Instruments Group and the Electromechanical Group. The Company
manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments for
segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
type, production processes, distribution methods, and management
organizations.

The Electronic Instruments Group produces instrumentation for
various electronic applications used in types of transportation
industries, including aircraft cockpit instruments and displays,
airborne electronics systems that monitor and record flight and
engine data, and pressure, temperature, flow and liquid-level
sensors for commercial airlines and aircraft and jet engine
manufacturers. The Group also produces analytical
instrumentation for the laboratory and research markets, as well
as instruments for food service equipment, measurement and
monitoring instrumentation for various process industries and
instruments and complete instrument panels for heavy truck
manufacturers and heavy construction and agricultural vehicles.
The Group also manufactures ultraprecise measurement
instrumentation, and thermoplastic compounds for automotive,
appliance, and telecommunications applications.

The Electromechanical Group produces air-moving electric motors
and motor-blower systems for manufacturers of floor care
appliances and outdoor power equipment, and fractional
horsepower and brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass
transit, medical equipment, computer and business machine
applications. The Group also produces high-purity metal powders
and alloys in powder, strip, and wire form for electronic
components, aircraft and automotive products, as well as heat
exchangers and thermal management subsystems. Sales of electric
motors, blowers, and fans represented 39.3% in 2004, 42.2% in
2003, and 41.7% in 2002 of the Company’s consolidated net
sales.

Measurement of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
and expenses (including certain administrative and other
expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include an
allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales,
which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are generally
based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment assets
include allocations directly related to the segment’s
operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of investments,
insurance deposits, and deferred taxes.

17.

Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. The
amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
point in time. The maximum amount of future payment obligations
relative to these various guarantees was approximately
$56.2 million, and the outstanding liability under certain
of those guarantees was approximately $7.8 million at
December 31, 2004. These guarantees expire in 2005 and 2006.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified
events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations, or retention of
previously existing


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

environmental, tax or employee liabilities) whose terms range in
duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where
appropriate, the obligation for such indemnifications is
recorded as a liability. Because the amount of these types of
indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the
overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
Company indemnifies its directors and officers who are or were
serving at the Company’s request in such capacities.
Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related
to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The
Company believes that future payments, if any, under all
existing indemnification agreements would not have a material
impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows.

Product Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the
most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and
adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
expenses.

Changes in the Company’s accrued product warranty
obligation for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
were as follows (in thousands):

Contingencies

Asbestos Litigation

The Company and/or its subsidiaries have been named as
defendants, along with many other companies, in a number of
asbestos-related lawsuits. To date, no judgments have been made
against the Company. The Company believes it has strong defenses
to the claims, and intends to continue to defend itself
vigorously in these matters. Other companies are also
indemnifying the Company against certain of these claims.

Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
existing at that time, the Company has been named a Potentially
Responsible Party (PRP) regarding waste remediation at
several non-AMETEK sites that are the subject of
government-mandated cleanups. In addition to these non-AMETEK
sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves
for probable remediation activities at certain of its
manufacturing locations and for claims and proceedings against
the Company with respect to other environmental matters once the
Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable.
Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2004 and 2003
were approximately $7.3 million and $6.4 million,
respectively. In 2004, the Company spent approximately
$1.0 million on such environmental matters, compared with
approximately $1.1 million in 2003.


AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also has agreements with former owners of certain of
its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously
owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements the former or
new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
under certain circumstances. The Company and some of the other
parties carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters.
To date, those parties have met their obligations in all
material respects. The Company has no reason to believe that
such third parties would fail to perform their obligations in
the future. However, if the Company were required to record a
liability with respect to all, or a portion of, such matters on
its balance sheet, the effect on income and the amount of the
liability would not be significant. In the opinion of
management, based upon presently available information and past
experience related to such matters, either adequate provision
for probable costs has been made, or the ultimate cost resulting
from these actions is not expected to materially affect the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows of the Company.
