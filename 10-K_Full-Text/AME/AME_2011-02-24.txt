Products
    and Services

The Company markets its products worldwide through two operating
    groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and
    the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). EIG builds
    monitoring, testing, calibration and display devices for the
    process, aerospace, industrial and power markets. EMG is a
    supplier of electromechanical devices. EMG produces highly
    engineered electromechanical connectors for hermetic
    (moisture-proof) applications, specialty metals for niche
    markets and brushless air-moving motors, blowers and heat
    exchangers. End markets include aerospace, defense, mass
    transit, medical, office products and other industrial markets.
    The Company continues to grow through strategic acquisitions
    focused on differentiated niche markets in instrumentation and
    electromechanical devices.

Competitive
    Strengths

Management believes that the Company has several significant
    competitive advantages that assist it in sustaining and
    enhancing its market positions. Its principal strengths include:

Significant Market Share.

AMETEK maintains a
    significant share in many of its targeted niche markets because
    of its ability to produce and deliver high-quality products at
    competitive prices. In EIG, the Company maintains significant
    market positions in many niche segments within the process,
    aerospace, industrial and power instrumentation markets. In EMG,
    the Company maintains significant market positions in many niche
    segments including aerospace, defense, mass transit, medical,
    office products and air-moving motors for the floorcare market.

Technological and Development
    Capabilities.

AMETEK believes it has certain
    technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to
    develop innovative products and maintain leading market
    positions. Historically, the Company has grown by extending its
    technical expertise into the manufacture of customized products
    for its customers, as well as through strategic acquisitions.
    EIG competes primarily on the basis of



product innovation in several highly specialized instrumentation
    markets, including process measurement, aerospace, power and
    heavy-vehicle dashboard instrumentation. EMG’s
    differentiated businesses focus on developing customized
    products for specialized applications in aerospace and defense,
    medical, business machines and other industrial applications. In
    its floorcare and specialty motor business, EMG focuses on low-
    cost design and manufacturing, while enhancing motor-blower
    performance through advances in power, efficiency, lighter
    weight and quieter operation.

Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing
    Operations.

EMG has motor manufacturing plants in
    China, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Brazil to lower its costs
    and achieve strategic proximity to its customers, providing the
    opportunity to increase international sales and market share.
    Certain of the Company’s electronic instrument businesses
    have relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
    Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and joint ventures in
    Europe, North America and Asia have resulted in additional cost
    savings and synergies through the consolidation of operations,
    product lines and distribution channels, which benefits both
    operating groups.

Experienced Management Team.

Another key
    component of AMETEK’s success is the strength of its
    management team and its commitment to the performance of the
    Company. AMETEK’s senior management has extensive
    experience, averaging approximately 25 years with the
    Company, and is financially committed to the Company’s
    success through Company-established stock ownership guidelines
    and equity incentive programs.

Business
    Strategy

AMETEK’s objectives are to increase the Company’s
    earnings and financial returns through a combination of
    operational and financial strategies. Those operational
    strategies include business acquisitions, new product
    development, global and market expansion and Operational
    Excellence programs designed to achieve double-digit annual
    percentage growth in earnings per share over the business cycle
    and a superior return on total capital. To support those
    operational objectives, financial initiatives have been, or may
    be, undertaken, including public and private debt or equity
    issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain
    foreign countries, accounts receivable securitization and share
    repurchases. AMETEK’s commitment to earnings growth is
    reflected in its continued implementation of cost-reduction
    programs designed to achieve the Company’s long-term
    best-cost objectives.

AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key
    strategies:

Operational Excellence.

Operational Excellence
    is AMETEK’s cornerstone strategy for improving profit
    margins and strengthening the Company’s competitive
    position across its businesses. Through its Operational
    Excellence strategy, the Company seeks to reduce production
    costs and improve its market positions. The strategy has played
    a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies.
    AMETEK believes that Operational Excellence, which focuses on
    Six Sigma process improvements, global sourcing and lean
    manufacturing and also emphasizes team building and a
    participative management culture, has enabled the Company to
    improve operating efficiencies and product quality, increase
    customer satisfaction and yield higher cash flow from
    operations, while lowering operating and administrative costs
    and shortening manufacturing cycle times.

    acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately
    $935 million, including 6 acquisitions in 2010 (see
    “Recent Acquisitions”). Through these and prior
    acquisitions, the Company’s management team has gained
    considerable experience in successfully acquiring and
    integrating new businesses. The Company intends to continue to
    pursue this acquisition strategy.



    OVERVIEW

Operating
    Performance

In 2010, AMETEK generated sales of $2.5 billion, an
    increase of 18% from 2009 and established records for operating
    income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings
    per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these
    results from strong internal growth in each of the
    Company’s two reportable segments, as well as contributions
    from recent acquisitions.

On November 2, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors
    declared a

three-for-two

split of the Company’s common stock. The stock split
    resulted in the issuance of one additional share for every two
    shares owned. The stock split was paid on December 21,
    2010, to stockholders of record at the close of business on
    December 10, 2010. Additionally, the Board of Directors
    approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate on
    the Company’s common stock to $0.06 per common share from
    $0.04 per common share on a post-split basis. All share and per
    share information included in this report reflects the impact of
    the stock split. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

In 2010, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its
    common stock for $78.6 million in cash under its current
    share purchase authorization. In 2009, the Company did not
    repurchase any shares of its common stock. At December 31,
    2010, $64.9 million was available under the current Board
    authorization for future share repurchases.

Financing

In the third quarter of 2010, the Company paid in full an
    expiring 50 million British pound ($78.2 million)
    5.96% senior note. In the third quarter of 2010, the
    Company issued an 80 million British pound
    ($124.8 million at December 31,
    2010) 4.68% senior note due in September 2020.

    blowers and pumps that offer long life, reliability and near
    maintenance-free operation. These motor-blower systems and heat
    exchangers are used for thermal management and other
    applications on a wide variety of military and commercial
    aircraft and military ground vehicles, and are used increasingly
    in medical and other applications, in which their long life, and
    spark-free and reliable operation is very important. These
    motors provide cooling and ventilation for business machines,
    computers and mass transit vehicles.

Haydon Enterprises, acquired in July 2010, has a product line
    which complements the Company’s highly differentiated
    technical motor business, which shares common markets, customers
    and distribution channels, and places AMETEK in a unique
    position as the premier industry provider of high-end linear and
    rotary motion control solutions.

EMG also serves the commercial and military aerospace
    third-party maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”)
    market. These businesses provide these services on a global
    basis with facilities in the United States, Europe and Singapore.

Ameron Global, acquired in December 2009, is a manufacturer of
    highly engineered pressurized gas components and systems for
    commercial and aerospace customers and is a leader in MRO of
    fire suppression and oxygen supply systems.

High Standard Aviation, acquired in January 2009, is a provider
    of electrical and electromechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic
    repair services to the aerospace industry.



Engineered
    Materials, Interconnects and Packaging Markets and
    Products

31% of EMG’s 2010 sales were engineered materials,
    interconnects and packaging products. AMETEK is an innovator and
    market leader in specialized metal powder, strip, wire and
    bonded products. It produces stainless steel and nickel clad
    alloys; stainless steel, cobalt and nickel alloy powders; metal
    strip; specialty shaped and electronic wire; and advanced metal
    matrix composites used in electronic thermal management. Its
    products are used in automotive, appliance, medical and
    surgical, aerospace, telecommunications, marine and general
    industrial applications. Its niche market focus is based upon
    proprietary manufacturing technology and strong customer
    relationships.

TSE, acquired in June 2010, expands the Company’s position
    in the medical device market and is an excellent fit with the
    HCC Industries division, which manufactures highly engineered
    electronic interconnects and microelectronics packaging for
    sophisticated electronic applications.

Floorcare
    and Specialty Motor Markets and Products

22% of EMG’s 2010 sales were to floorcare and
    specialty motor markets, where it has the leading share, through
    its sales of air-moving electric motors to most of the
    world’s major floorcare OEMs, including vertically
    integrated OEMs that produce some of their own motors. EMG
    produces motor-blowers for a full range of floorcare products,
    ranging from hand-held, canister and upright vacuums to central
    vacuums for residential use. High-performance vacuum motors also
    are marketed for commercial and industrial applications.

The Company also manufactures a variety of specialty motors used
    in a wide range of products, such as household and personal care
    appliances; fitness equipment; electric materials handling
    vehicles; and sewing machines. Additionally, its products are
    used in outdoor power equipment, such as electric chain saws,
    leaf blowers, string trimmers and power washers.

EMG has been successful in directing a portion of its global
    floorcare marketing at vertically integrated vacuum cleaner
    manufacturers, who seek to outsource all or part of their motor
    production. By purchasing their motors from EMG, these customers
    are able to realize economic and operational advantages by
    reducing or discontinuing their own motor production and
    avoiding the capital investment required to keep their motor
    manufacturing current with changing technologies and market
    demands.

Customers

EMG is not dependent on any single customer such that the loss
    of that customer would have a material adverse effect on
    EMG’s operations. Approximately 10% of EMG’s 2010
    sales were made to its five largest customers.

Marketing

The Company’s marketing efforts generally are organized and
    carried out at the division level. EIG makes significant use of
    distributors and sales representatives in marketing its
    products, as well as direct sales in some of its more
    technically sophisticated products. Within aerospace, its
    specialized customer base of aircraft and jet engine
    manufacturers is served primarily by direct sales engineers.
    Given the technical nature of many of its products, as well as
    its significant worldwide market share, EMG conducts much of its
    domestic and international marketing activities through a direct
    sales force and makes some use of sales representatives and
    distributors both in the United States and in other countries.

Competition

In general, most of the Company’s markets are highly
    competitive. The principal elements of competition for the
    Company’s products are product technology, distribution,
    quality, service and price.



In the markets served by EIG, the Company believes that it ranks
    among the leading U.S. producers of certain measuring and
    control instruments. It also is a leader in the
    U.S. heavy-vehicle instrumentation and power instrument
    markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers
    to the commercial aviation market. Competition remains strong
    and can intensify for certain EIG products, especially its
    pressure gauge and heavy-vehicle instrumentation products. Both
    of these businesses have several strong competitors. In the
    process and analytical instruments market, numerous companies in
    each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality,
    performance and innovation. The aerospace and power instrument
    businesses have a number of diversified competitors, which vary
    depending on the specific market niche.

EMG’s differentiated businesses have competition from a
    limited number of companies in each of their markets.
    Competition is generally based on product innovation,
    performance and price. There also is competition from
    alternative materials and processes. In its floorcare and
    specialty motor businesses, EMG has limited domestic competition
    in the U.S. floorcare market from independent
    manufacturers. Competition is increasing from Asian motor
    manufacturers that serve both the U.S. and the European
    floorcare markets. Increasingly, global vacuum motor production
    is being shifted to Asia where AMETEK has a smaller but growing
    market position. There is potential competition from vertically
    integrated manufacturers of floorcare products that produce
    their own motor-blowers. Many of these manufacturers would also
    be potential EMG customers if they decided to outsource their
    motor production.

Backlog
    and Seasonal Variations of Business

The Company’s backlog of unfilled orders by business
    segment was as follows at December 31:

The higher backlog at December 31, 2010 was due to higher
    order levels and the acquired backlog of 2010 acquisitions.

Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31,
    2010, approximately 83% is expected to be shipped by
    December 31, 2011. The Company believes that neither its
    business as a whole, nor either of its reportable segments, is
    subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain
    individual operations experience some seasonal variability.

Availability
    of Raw Materials

The Company’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and
    supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than
    one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various
    base metals and certain steel components, are available only
    from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes its
    sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs.

Research,
    Product Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development and engineering costs
    before customer reimbursement were $112.1 million,
    $101.4 million and $115.9 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were $6.4 million, $5.5 million and
    $6.1 million, respectively. These amounts included net
    Company-funded research and development expenses of
    $56.8 million, $50.5 million and $57.5 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



All such expenditures were directed toward the development of
    new products and processes and the improvement of existing
    products and processes.

Environmental
    Matters

Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth
    in the section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations entitled
    “Environmental Matters” and in Note 20 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Patents,
    Licenses and Trademarks

The Company owns numerous unexpired U.S. patents and
    foreign patents, including counterparts of its more important
    U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the
    world. The Company is a licensor or licensee under patent
    agreements of various types and its products are marketed under
    various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign
    trademarks and trade names. However, the Company does not
    consider any single patent or trademark, or any group thereof,
    essential either to its business as a whole or to either of its
    business segments. The annual royalties received or paid under
    license agreements are not significant to either of its
    reportable segments or to the Company’s overall operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2010, the Company employed approximately
    11,600 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of
    whom approximately 2,300 employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. The Company has two collective
    bargaining agreements that will expire in 2011, which cover less
    than 100 employees. The Company expects no material adverse
    effects from the pending labor contract negotiations.

Working
    Capital Practices

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital
    requirements in either of its reportable segments. Customers
    generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include
    extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled
    and maintained at levels related to production cycles and are
    responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all
    other information contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect
    our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

A
    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor markets could adversely affect
    our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in
    nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control.
    A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor markets could have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our
    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be
    able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate
    recent and future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of
    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2006, through
    December 31, 2010, we have completed 27 acquisitions. We
    plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our
    global market position and broaden our product offerings.
    Although we have been successful with



our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to
    successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a
    number of factors, including:

•

Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;

•

The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may
    increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate
    acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a
    greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;

•

Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including
    integrating the financial, technological and management
    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses
    with those of our existing operations;

•

Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms
    acceptable to us;

•

U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting
    our ability to make certain acquisitions;

•

Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of
    acquired businesses;

•

Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

•

Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity
    and complexity of our operations.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing
    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and
    may require additional financial resources and attention from
    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing
    development or expansion of our existing operations.
    Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired
    business may not achieve the results we expected or produce
    expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue
    with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of
    acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

We may
    experience unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    product line transfers.

Certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently
    relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
    Unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    completing product line transfers, as well as possible
    underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in
    production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our
    business and operations.

Our
    substantial international sales and operations are subject to
    customary risks associated with international
    operations.

International sales for 2010 and 2009 represented 49.0% and
    49.2% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result
    of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of
    sales outside the United States will increase in the future.
    International operations are subject to the customary risks of
    operating in an international environment, including:

•

Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;

•

Overlap of different tax structures;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;



•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including
    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries
    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;

•

Restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

General economic conditions;

•

Unstable political situations;

•

Nationalization of assets; and

•

Compliance with a wide variety of international and
    U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.

Our
    international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by
    compliance with export laws.

We are required to comply with various import, export, export
    control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our
    transactions with certain customers, business partners and other
    persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our
    employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export
    control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the
    export of certain products, services and technologies and in
    other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export
    license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure
    to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil
    and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions
    to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export
    products and services and damage to our reputation.

Any
    inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to
    compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate
    acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those
    businesses, manage our expanding international operations and
    otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and
    retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary
    to attract and motivate these officers and employees may
    adversely affect our results of operations.

If we
    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could
    adversely affect our business and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our
    ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced
    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.
    Although we believe we have certain technological and other
    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages
    will require us to continue investing in research and
    development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance
    that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments,
    that we will be able to make the technological advances
    necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can
    recover major research and development expenses. We are not
    currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which
    could render our existing products obsolete, although there can
    be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able
    to develop and successfully market new products.

A
    shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could
    increase our operating costs.

We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material
    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;
    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel
    components, are available only from a limited number of
    suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations.
    Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could
    affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our
    competitive position, which could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.



Certain
    environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs
    associated with hazardous or toxic substance

clean-up

which may adversely affect our financial
    condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a
    number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
    occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning,
    among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the
    use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage,
    transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
    Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing
    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous
    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of
    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at
    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew
    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous
    materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint
    and several liability for

clean-up

costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing
    hazardous substances to sites designated for

clean-up

under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible
    party at several sites, which are the subject of
    government-mandated

clean-ups.

As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that
    use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous
    materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation,
    removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to
    compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to
    precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending
    environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we
    believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have
    a material adverse effect on our financial position or future
    results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations,
    new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement
    of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis
    for new or increased liabilities that could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. There can be no assurance that future
    environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental
    damages due to prior or present practices will not result in
    future liabilities.

We are
    subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be
    burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and
    foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing
    laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new
    laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change,
    may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our
    products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or
    regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and
    regulations will have on our business or operations.

We may
    be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with
    alleged or actual harm caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product
    liability claims in the event that the use of our products is
    alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For
    example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for
    personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for
    instance, an aircraft component that has been designed,
    manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant
    liability if product liability lawsuits against us are
    successful. While we believe our current general liability and
    product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from
    future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate
    to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be
    able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an
    acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for
    which third-party indemnification is not available could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We
    operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely
    affect our results of operations or ability to expand our
    business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and
    internationally, with individual producers, as well as with
    vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have
    resources greater than we do. The principal elements of
    competition for our products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality and service. EMG’s competition in
    specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and
    processes. In the markets served by



EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is
    strong and could intensify. In the pressure gauge, aerospace and
    heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limited number of
    companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance
    and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve
    existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt
    more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our
    customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not
    be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in
    which it operates or that our products will be able to compete
    successfully with those of our competitors.

Restrictions
    contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt
    agreements may limit our ability to incur additional
    indebtedness.

Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements
    contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our
    ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit
    our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our
    financial flexibility.

We are
    subject to possible insolvency of financial
    counterparties.

We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts
    including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit
    facilities, financial derivatives and investment management
    agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to
    the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become
    insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its obligations
    under such contracts.

Our
    goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial
    amount of our total assets and write-off of such substantial
    goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible
    assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2010, goodwill
    and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
    totaled $2,335.2 million or 61% of our total assets. The
    goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess
    of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other
    identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum,
    we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the
    value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance
    at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly
    below current levels, we could record, under current applicable
    accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for
    goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination
    requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or
    other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Properties

The Company has 110 operating plant facilities in 23 states
    and 13 foreign countries. Of these facilities, 54 are owned by
    the Company and 56 are leased. The properties owned by the
    Company consist of approximately 674 acres, of which
    approximately 4.3 million square feet are under roof. Under
    lease is a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet.
    The leases expire over a range of years from 2011 to 2082, with
    renewal options for varying terms contained in many of the
    leases. Production facilities in China, Taiwan and Japan provide
    the Company with additional production capacity through the
    Company’s investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures.
    The Company’s executive offices in Berwyn, Pennsylvania,
    occupy approximately 43,000 square feet under a lease that
    expires in September 2023.

The Company’s machinery and equipment, plants and offices
    are in satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the
    uses to which they are put. The operating facilities of the
    Company by business segment were as follows at December 31,
    2010:

for information regarding certain litigation matters.

In addition to those litigation matters described above, the
    Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of
    litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business.
    These lawsuits may involve claims for damages arising out of the
    use of the Company’s products and services, personal
    injury, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes and
    intellectual property matters. The Company may also become
    subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions.
    Based upon the Company’s experience, the Company does not
    believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material
    adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position
    or cash flows.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The principal market on which the Company’s common stock is
    traded is the New York Stock Exchange and it is traded under the
    symbol “AME.” On January 31, 2011, there were
    approximately 2,200 holders of record of the Company’s
    common stock.

Market price and dividend information with respect to the
    Company’s common stock is set forth below. Future dividend
    payments by the Company will be dependent on future earnings,
    financial requirements, contractual provisions of debt
    agreements and other relevant factors.

Under its share repurchase program, the Company repurchased
    3.1 million shares of common stock for $78.6 million
    in 2010 to offset the dilutive effect of shares granted as
    equity-based compensation. The Company did not repurchase shares
    in 2009.

EBITDA represents income before
    interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is
    presented because the Company is aware that it is used by rating
    agencies, securities analysts, investors and other parties in
    evaluating the Company. It should not be considered, however, as
    an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the
    Company’s operating performance or as an alternative to
    cash flows as a measure of the Company’s overall liquidity
    as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Furthermore, EBITDA measures shown for the Company
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
    companies. The following table presents the reconciliation of
    net income reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted

Business
    Overview

As a global business, AMETEK’s operations are affected by
    global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the
    Company’s strategic geographic and industry
    diversification, and its mix of products and services, have
    helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable
    developments in any one industry or the economy of any single
    country on its consolidated operating results. In 2010, the
    Company posted strong sales and established records for
    operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted
    earnings per share and operating cash flow. The impact of
    contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful
    Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on
    2010 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic
    initiatives under AMETEK’s four growth strategies:
    Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and
    Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.
    Highlights of 2010 were:

•

In 2010, sales were $2.47 billion, an increase of
    $372.6 million or 18% from 2009, on internal growth of
    approximately 15% in the Electronic Instruments Group
    (“EIG”) and 12% in the Electromechanical Group
    (“EMG”) excluding the effect of foreign currency
    translation, and contributions from the 2009 and 2010
    acquisitions.

•

Net income for 2010 was $283.9 million, an increase of
    $78.1 million or 37.9% when compared with
    $205.8 million in 2009.

•

During 2010, the Company completed the following acquisitions:

•

In January 2010, the Company acquired Sterling Ultra Precision,
    a privately held reseller of machine tools for the ophthalmic
    lens market.

•

In April 2010, the Company acquired Imago Scientific
    Instruments, a privately held manufacturer of 3D atom probes.

•

In June 2010, the Company acquired Technical Services for
    Electronics (“TSE”), a manufacturer of engineered
    interconnect solutions for the medical device industry.

•

In July 2010, the Company acquired Haydon Enterprises, a leader
    in linear actuators and lead screw assemblies for the medical,
    industrial equipment, aerospace, analytical instrument, computer
    peripheral and semiconductor industries.

•

In August 2010, the Company acquired American Reliance’s
    Power Division (“AMREL Power”), a provider of highly
    differentiated direct current power supplies and electronic
    loads for the automated test equipment market.

•

In November 2010, the Company acquired Atlas Material Testing
    Technology LLC (“Atlas”), the world’s leading
    provider of weathering test instruments and related testing and
    consulting services.

•

Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow provided by
    operating activities that totaled $423.0 million, a
    $58.3 million or 16.0% increase from 2009.



•

The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales
    presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales,
    were $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of consolidated sales in
    2010, compared with $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of
    consolidated sales in 2009.

•

New orders for 2010 were $2,651.3 million, an increase of
    $623.2 million or 30.7% when compared with
    $2,028.1 million in 2009. As a result, the Company’s
    backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2010 was a
    record at $828.8 million.

•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research,
    development and engineering, spending $112.1 million in
    2010 before customer reimbursement of $6.4 million. Sales
    from products introduced in the last three years were
    $473.2 million or 19.2% of sales.

•

In the third quarter of 2010, the Company paid in full an
    expiring 50 million British pound ($78.2 million)
    5.96% senior note. In the third quarter of 2010, the
    Company issued an 80 million British pound
    ($124.8 million at December 31,
    2010) 4.68% senior note due in September 2020.

•

On November 2, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors
    declared a

three-for-two

split of the Company’s common stock. The stock split
    resulted in the issuance of one additional share for every two
    shares owned. The stock split was paid on December 21,
    2010, to stockholders of record at the close of business on
    December 10, 2010. Additionally, the Board of Directors
    approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate on
    the Company’s common stock to $0.06 per common share from
    $0.04 per common share on a post-split basis. See Note 2 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Year
    Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2009

Results
    of Operations

In 2010, the Company posted strong sales and established records
    for operating income, operating income margins, net income,
    diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company
    achieved these results from strong internal growth in both EIG
    and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions completed in
    2010 and the acquisitions of High Standard Aviation in January
    2009 and Ameron Global in December 2009. In the fourth quarter
    of 2009, the Company began to experience increased order rates
    which continued through 2010. The full year impact of the 2010
    acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities should
    have a positive impact on our 2011 results.

Net sales for 2010 were $2,471.0 million, an increase of
    $372.6 million or 17.8% when compared with net sales of
    $2,098.4 million in 2009. Net sales for EIG were
    $1,324.1 million in 2010, an increase of 15.5% from sales
    of $1,146.6 million in 2009. Net sales for EMG were
    $1,146.8 million in 2010, an increase of 20.5% from sales
    of $951.8 million in 2009. The increase in net sales was
    primarily attributable to higher order rates, as well as the
    impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales
    increase for 2010 was driven by strong internal sales growth of
    approximately 13%, with no impact from foreign currency
    translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the
    remainder of the net sales increase.

Total international sales for 2010 were $1,211.3 million or
    49.0% of consolidated net sales, an increase of
    $179.6 million or 17.4% when compared with international
    sales of $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of consolidated net
    sales in 2009. The $179.6 million increase in international
    sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above, as well as
    continued expansion into Asia, and includes the effect of
    foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the
    Company maintain a strong international sales presence in Europe
    and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are
    included in total international sales, were $564.5 million
    in 2010, an increase of $150.4 million or 36.3% compared
    with $414.1 million in 2009. Export shipments improved due
    to increased exports from both the base businesses and the
    acquisitions noted above.

New orders for 2010 were $2,651.3 million, an increase of
    $623.2 million or 30.7% when compared with
    $2,028.1 million in 2009. Throughout most of 2009, the
    Company experienced lower order rates primarily as a result of
    the global economic recession, which began in late 2008 and
    continued through most of 2009. However, order rates stabilized
    in the third quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth
    quarter of 2009. For 2010, internal order growth was
    approximately 23%, excluding a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign
    currency translation, driven by both the Company’s
    differentiated and cost-driven businesses, with the acquisitions
    mentioned above accounting for the remainder of the increase. As
    a result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at
    December 31, 2010 was $828.8 million, an increase of
    $180.4 million or 27.8% when compared with
    $648.4 million at December 31, 2009.

Segment operating income for 2010 was $526.6 million, an
    increase of $127.1 million or 31.8% when compared with
    segment operating income of $399.5 million in 2009. Segment
    operating income, as a percentage of sales, increased to 21.3%
    in 2010 from 19.0% in 2009. The increase in segment operating
    income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from the
    leveraged impact of the Company’s net sales increase noted
    above, as well as the benefits of the Company’s lower cost
    structure through Operational Excellence initiatives, which
    includes the impact of the 2008 restructuring.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses for 2010 were $296.5 million, an increase of
    $42.4 million or 16.7% when compared with
    $254.1 million in 2009. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
    expenses were 12.0% for 2010, compared with 12.1% in 2009.
    Selling expense increased $32.4 million or 14.7% for 2010,
    which is in line with internal sales growth. Selling expenses,
    as a percentage of sales, decreased to 10.3% for 2010, compared
    with 10.5% for 2009. Additionally, the Company’s
    acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated
    businesses, which because of their distribution channels and
    higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling
    expenses. Base business selling expenses increased approximately
    11.1%.



Corporate administrative expenses for 2010 were
    $43.1 million, an increase of $9.9 million or 29.8%
    when compared with $33.2 million in 2009. As a percentage
    of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.7% for 2010,
    compared with 1.6% in 2009. The increase in corporate
    administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher
    compensation related expenses, as well as other costs necessary
    to grow the business.

Consolidated operating income was $482.2 million or 19.5%
    of sales for 2010, an increase of $116.1 million or 31.7%
    when compared with $366.1 million or 17.4% of sales in 2009.

Interest expense was $67.5 million for 2010, a decrease of
    $1.3 million or 1.9% when compared with $68.8 million
    in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the
    repayment of 40 million British-pound-denominated debt
    under the revolving credit facility in the second quarter of
    2009 and 50 million British-pound-denominated senior note
    in the third quarter of 2010, partially offset by the issuance
    of an 80 million British-pound-denominated senior note in
    the third quarter of 2010.

Other expenses, net were $8.4 million for 2010, an increase
    of $5.7 million when compared with $2.7 million in
    2009. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition related
    expenses.

The effective tax rate for 2010 was 30.1% compared with 30.2% in
    2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 primarily reflects the
    impact of settlements of income tax examinations and the
    benefits obtained from international and state income tax
    planning initiatives. See Note 14 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further details.

Net income for 2010 was $283.9 million, an increase of
    $78.1 million or 37.9% when compared with
    $205.8 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share for 2010
    was $1.76, an increase of $0.49 or 38.6% when compared with
    $1.27 per diluted share in 2009.

Segment
    Results

EIG’s

sales totaled $1,324.1 million for 2010,
    an increase of $177.5 million or 15.5% when compared with
    $1,146.6 million in 2009. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 15%, with no impact from
    foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EIG’s
    process, power and industrial businesses. The acquisition of
    Atlas primarily accounted for the remainder of the sales
    increase.

EIG’s operating income was $316.2 million for 2010, an
    increase of $83.3 million or 35.8% when compared with
    $232.9 million in 2009. EIG’s operating margins were
    23.9% of sales for 2010 compared with 20.3% of sales in 2009.
    The increase in segment operating income and operating margins
    was driven by the leveraged impact of the Group’s increase
    in sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Group’s
    lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.

EMG’s

sales totaled $1,146.8 million for 2010,
    an increase of $195.0 million or 20.5% from
    $951.8 million in 2009. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 12%, with no impact from
    foreign currency translation. The acquisitions of Ameron Global,
    TSE and Haydon Enterprises primarily accounted for the remainder
    of the sales increase.

EMG’s operating income was $210.4 million for 2010, an
    increase of $43.8 million or 26.3% when compared with
    $166.6 million in 2009. EMG’s operating margins were
    18.3% of sales for 2010 compared with 17.5% of sales in 2009.
    EMG’s increase in operating income and operating margins
    was primarily due to the leveraged impact of the Group’s
    higher sales, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above.

Results
    of Operations

In 2009, the Company posted solid sales, operating income, net
    income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow given the
    global economic recession. The Company’s results include
    contributions from acquisitions completed in 2009 and the
    acquisitions of Motion Control Group (“MCG”), Drake
    Air (“Drake”) and Newage Testing Instruments in
    February 2008, Reading Alloys in April 2008, Vision Research,
    Inc. in June 2008, the programmable power business of Xantrex
    Technology, Inc. (“Xantrex Programmable”) in August
    2008 and Muirhead Aerospace Limited (“Muirhead”) in
    November 2008. The impact of the global economic recession
    stabilized in the third quarter of 2009, with improved operating
    results in the fourth quarter of 2009 in most of the
    Company’s markets when compared to the previous quarters of
    2009.

Net sales for 2009 were $2,098.4 million, a decrease of
    $432.7 million or 17.1% when compared with net sales of
    $2,531.1 million in 2008. Net sales for EIG were
    $1,146.6 million in 2009, a decrease of 18.3% from sales of
    $1,402.7 million in 2008. Net sales for EMG were
    $951.8 million in 2009, a decrease of 15.7% from sales of
    $1,128.5 million in 2008. The decline in net sales was
    primarily attributable to lower order rates as a result of the
    global economic recession, partially offset by the impact of the
    acquisitions mentioned above. The Company’s internal sales
    declined approximately 21% in 2009, which excludes a 2%
    unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The
    acquisitions mentioned above offset approximately 6% of the
    Company’s internal sales decline.

Total international sales for 2009 were $1,031.7 million or
    49.2% of consolidated net sales, a decrease of
    $193.8 million or 15.8% when compared with international
    sales of $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of consolidated net
    sales in 2008. The decline in international sales resulted from
    decreased international sales from base businesses of
    $272.5 million, which includes the effect of foreign
    currency translation, partially offset by the impact of the
    acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2008. The Company maintains a
    strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia by both
    reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States,
    which are included in total international sales, were
    $400.6 million in 2009, a decrease of $77.9 million or
    16.3% compared with $478.5 million in 2008. Export
    shipments declined primarily due to decreased exports from the
    base businesses, partially offset by the acquisitions noted
    above.

New orders for 2009 were $2,028.1 million, a decrease of
    $533.4 million or 20.8% when compared with
    $2,561.5 million in 2008. Throughout most of 2009, the
    Company experienced lower order rates as a result of the global
    economic recession. However, order rates stabilized in the third
    quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of
    2009. As a result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders
    at December 31, 2009 was $648.4 million, a decrease of
    $70.2 million or 9.8% when compared with
    $718.6 million at December 31, 2008.

Segment operating income for 2009 was $399.5 million, a
    decrease of $82.4 million or 17.1% when compared with
    segment operating income of $481.9 million in 2008. Segment
    operating income, as a percentage of sales, was 19.0% in both
    2009 and 2008. The decrease in segment operating income resulted
    primarily from the decrease in sales noted above and higher
    defined benefit pension expense, partially offset by profit
    contributions made by the acquisitions and cost reduction
    initiatives, including $135 million of cost savings
    achieved in 2009 primarily from the restructuring activities
    related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges.

SG&A expenses for 2009 were $254.1 million, a decrease
    of $68.5 million or 21.2% when compared with
    $322.6 million in 2008. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
    expenses were 12.1% for 2009, compared with 12.7% in 2008. The
    decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of lower
    sales and the Company’s cost savings initiatives.
    Additionally, 2008 SG&A expenses include both a
    $7.1 million charge, recorded in corporate administrative
    expenses, related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2005
    restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2008 and
    $7.1 million of SG&A expense related to fourth quarter
    of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. Base
    business selling expenses decreased approximately 22%, which was
    in line with the Company’s 2009 sales decline. Selling
    expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 10.5% for 2009,
    compared with 10.8% in 2008 due to the previously mentioned cost
    savings initiatives.



Corporate administrative expenses for 2009 were
    $33.2 million, a decrease of $16.0 million or 32.5%
    when compared with $49.2 million in 2008. As a percentage
    of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.6% for 2009,
    compared with 1.9% in 2008. The decrease in corporate
    administrative expenses was driven by the equity-based
    compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of
    restricted stock in the second quarter of 2008, lower short-term
    incentive compensation in 2009 and the Company’s cost
    saving initiatives, including the restructuring activities,
    noted above.

Consolidated operating income was $366.1 million or 17.4%
    of sales for 2009, a decrease of $66.6 million or 15.4%
    when compared with $432.7 million or 17.1% of sales in 2008.

Interest expense was $68.8 million for 2009, an increase of
    $5.1 million or 8.0% when compared with $63.7 million
    in 2008. The increase was due to the full-year impact of the
    funding of the long-term private placement senior notes in the
    third and fourth quarters of 2008, partially offset by the
    repayment of 40 million British-pound-denominated debt
    under the revolving credit facility in the second quarter of
    2009.

The effective tax rate for 2009 was 30.2% compared with 32.6% in
    2008. The lower effective tax rate for 2009 primarily reflects
    the impact of settlements of income tax examinations and the
    benefits obtained from state and international income tax
    planning initiatives. The higher effective tax rate for 2008
    primarily reflects an increase in state and foreign income taxes
    and the impact of accelerated vesting of non-deductible
    restricted stock amortization, offset by the impact of
    settlements of various income tax issues with U.S. taxing
    authorities and a favorable agreement in the United Kingdom
    related to deductible interest expense for which previously
    unrecognized tax benefits were recognized. See Note 14 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further details.

Net income for 2009 was $205.8 million, a decrease of
    $41.2 million or 16.7% when compared with
    $247.0 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2009
    was $1.27, a decrease of $0.26 or 17.0% when compared with $1.53
    per diluted share in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2008
    includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted
    earnings by $0.17 per diluted share.

Segment
    Results

EIG’s

sales totaled $1,146.6 million for 2009,
    a decrease of $256.1 million or 18.3% when compared with
    $1,402.7 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an
    internal sales decline of approximately 20%, excluding an
    unfavorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation, driven
    primarily by EIG’s process and industrial products
    businesses. Partially offsetting the sales decrease were the
    2008 acquisitions of Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex
    Programmable.

EIG’s operating income was $232.9 million for 2009, a
    decrease of $73.9 million or 24.1% when compared with
    $306.8 million in 2008. EIG’s operating margins were
    20.3% of sales for 2009 compared with 21.9% of sales in 2008.
    The decrease in segment operating income and operating margins
    was driven by the decrease in sales noted above, predominantly
    by weakness in the aerospace aftermarket, process and industrial
    businesses and higher defined benefit pension expense, which was
    partially offset by the cost savings achieved from the
    restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008
    restructuring charges. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million had a
    negative impact on EIG’s operating margins of
    140 basis points.

EMG’s

sales totaled $951.8 million for 2009, a
    decrease of $176.7 million or 15.7% from
    $1,128.5 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an
    internal sales decline of approximately 21%, excluding an
    unfavorable 3% effect of foreign currency translation, driven
    primarily by the engineered materials, interconnects and
    packaging (“EMIP”) and cost-driven motors businesses.
    Partially offsetting the sales decrease were the 2009
    acquisition of High Standard Aviation and the 2008 acquisitions
    of Drake, MCG, Reading Alloys and Muirhead.

EMG’s operating income was $166.6 million for 2009, a
    decrease of $8.6 million or 4.9% when compared with
    $175.2 million in 2008. EMG’s decrease in operating
    income was driven by the decrease in sales noted above,



predominantly by weakness in the EMIP businesses, which was
    partially offset by profit contributions made by the
    acquisitions mentioned above and the fourth quarter of 2008
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs of
    $19.4 million. EMG’s operating margins were 17.5% of
    sales for 2009 compared with 15.5% of sales in 2008. The
    increase in operating margins was primarily driven by
    Operational Excellence capabilities and cost reduction
    initiatives throughout the Group, including the cost savings
    achieved from the restructuring activities related to the fourth
    quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. The
    fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs of $19.4 million had a negative impact on
    operating margins of 170 basis points.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were
    $523.5 million, a decrease of $100.2 million or 16.1%
    when compared with net sales of $623.7 million for the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for EIG were
    $286.0 million in 2009, a decrease of 20.9% from sales of
    $361.6 million in 2008. Net sales for EMG were
    $237.5 million in 2009, a decrease of 9.4% from sales of
    $262.1 million in 2008. The Company’s internal sales
    decline was approximately 20%, which excludes a 2% favorable
    effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions
    mentioned above offset approximately 2% of the Company’s
    internal sales decline.

The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include
    pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the
    effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.17 per
    diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million),
    as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the
    $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in
    cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges
    and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in
    segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG,
    $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate
    administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans
    established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives
    that were broadly implemented across the Company’s various
    businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include
    the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of
    production to low-cost locales and a general reduction in
    workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes
    in certain of the Company’s businesses. The Company
    recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance
    costs for more than 10% of the Company’s workforce. The
    Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for
    lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain
    facilities in 2009. See Note 6 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further details.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was
    $51.9 million, an increase of $8.1 million or 18.5%
    when compared with $43.8 million for the fourth quarter of
    2008. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009
    was $0.32, an increase of $0.05 or 17.1% when compared with
    $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Diluted
    earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of
    2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which
    negatively impacted earnings by $0.17 per diluted share.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $423.0 million in 2010, an increase of $58.3 million
    or 16.0% when compared with $364.7 million in 2009. The
    increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily
    due to the $78.2 million increase in net income and a
    $17.6 million reduction in defined benefit pension
    contributions paid. The increase in cash provided by operating
    activities was partially offset by higher overall operating
    working capital levels necessary to grow the Company’s
    businesses. Free cash flow (cash flow provided by operating
    activities less capital expenditures) was $383.8 million in
    2010, compared to $331.6 million in 2009. EBITDA (earnings
    before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization)
    was $545.9 million in 2010, compared with
    $428.0 million in 2009. Free cash flow and EBITDA are
    presented because the Company is aware that they are measures
    used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the
    “Notes to Selected Financial Data” included in
    Item 6 in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (“GAAP”) measures to comparable non-GAAP
    measures).



Cash used for investing activities totaled $566.8 million
    in 2010, compared with $106.3 million in 2009. In 2010, the
    Company paid $538.6 million for six business acquisitions,
    net of cash received, compared with $72.9 million paid for
    three business acquisitions, net of cash received, in 2009.
    Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled
    $39.2 million in 2010, compared with $33.1 million in
    2009.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $62.6 million
    in 2010, compared with $102.5 million of cash used for
    financing activities in 2009. The change in financing cash flow
    was primarily the result of the net total borrowings increase
    described further below, partially offset by $78.6 million
    used for repurchases of 3.1 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock in 2010. No shares were repurchased
    in 2009. In January 2010, the Board of Directors approved an
    increase of $75 million in the authorization for the
    repurchase of its common stock. This increase was added to the
    $68.5 million that remained available at December 31,
    2009 from existing authorizations approved in 2008, for a total
    of $143.5 million available for repurchases of the
    Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2010,
    $64.9 million was available under the current Board
    authorization for future share repurchases.

In 2010, net total borrowings increased by $139.3 million,
    compared with a net total borrowings decrease of
    $92.4 million in 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, the
    Company paid in full an expiring 50 million British pound
    ($78.2 million) 5.96% senior note. In the third
    quarter of 2010, the Company issued an 80 million British
    pound ($124.8 million at December 31,
    2010) 4.68% senior note due in September 2020. In the
    second quarter of 2009, the Company paid in full a
    40 million British pound ($62.0 million) borrowing
    under the revolving credit facility. In the fourth quarter of
    2009, the Company paid in full a 10.5 million British pound
    ($16.9 million) floating-rate term note.

The Company’s revolving credit facility’s total
    borrowing capacity is $550 million, which includes an
    accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an
    additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at
    any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under
    certain conditions. The facility expires in June 2012. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had $437.3 million
    available under its revolving credit facility, including the
    $100 million accordion feature. At December 31, 2010,
    $92.0 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility.

At December 31, 2010, total debt outstanding was
    $1,168.5 million, compared with $1,041.7 million at
    December 31, 2009, with no significant maturities until
    2012. The

debt-to-capital

ratio was 39.7% at December 31, 2010, compared with 39.9%
    at December 31, 2009. The net

debt-to-capital

ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the
    sum of net debt and stockholders’ equity) was 36.2% at
    December 31, 2010, compared with 33.7% at December 31,
    2009. The net

debt-to-capital

ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this
    measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See
    the “Notes to Selected Financial Data” included in
    Item 6 in this Annual Report on

for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable
    non-GAAP measures).

Additional financing activities for 2010 include the receipt of
    net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of
    $21.5 million compared with $11.6 million in 2009.
    Cash dividends paid were $28.6 million in 2010, compared
    with $25.6 million in 2009.

As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in
    2010, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010
    totaled $163.2 million, compared with $246.4 million
    at December 31, 2009. The Company is in compliance with all
    covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt
    agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient
    cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted
    foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to
    long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs
    and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.

Other
    Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of
    $23.2 million related to performance and payment guarantees
    at December 31, 2010. Based on experience with these
    arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may
    arise will not be material to its financial position.

The Company may, from time to time, repurchase its long-term
    debt in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon
    availability, market conditions and other factors.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as
    those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on
    the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations and that require the use of complex and
    subjective estimates based upon past experience and
    management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent
    in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the
    estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and
    related notes contain information that is pertinent to the
    Company’s accounting policies and to Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents
    additional specific disclosures about the Company’s
    accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective
    decisions or assessments whereby



materially different results of operations and financial
    condition could have been reported had different assumptions
    been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of
    the Company’s significant accounting policies is in
    Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is
    complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the
    customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under
    which title and risk of loss have been transferred,
    collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or
    determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and
    risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes
    revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other
    criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with
    respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that
    the customer may not return products or be given allowances,
    except at the Company’s option. The Company has agreements
    with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return
    for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from
    the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to
    the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
    incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume
    discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a
    reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for
    sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are
    provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past
    experience. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    accrual for future warranty obligations was $18.3 million,
    $16.0 million and $16.1 million, respectively. The
    Company’s expense for warranty obligations was
    $10.6 million, $8.2 million and $12.2 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The warranty periods for
    products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations,
    but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company
    calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty
    experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect
    actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and
    allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience,
    additional accruals may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains
    allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
    specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the
    Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against
    the amount due from these customers. For all other customers,
    the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the
    length of time specific receivables are past due based on its
    historical experience. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their
    inability to make payments, additional allowances may be
    required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $6.0 million and $5.8 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which
    approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 69% of
    its inventories at December 31, 2010. The

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to
    determine cost for the remaining 31% of its inventory at
    December 31, 2010. For inventories where cost is determined
    by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been
    $23.9 million and $20.8 million higher than the LIFO
    value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company
    provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and
    obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future
    demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing
    financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If
    these factors are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily
    trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are
    tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for
    goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is to
    compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net
    assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair
    value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is
    required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying
    amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be
    completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the
    reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess
    being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount
    of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The
    Company would be required to record any such impairment losses.



The Company identifies its reporting units at the component
    level, which is one level below our operating segments.
    Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific
    operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in
    which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting
    units are composed of the business units one level below our
    operating segment at which discrete financial information is
    prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow
    analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
    which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an
    appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market
    participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to
    determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale
    transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the
    Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning
    future levels of revenue growth, operating margins,
    depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements,
    which are based upon the Company’s long-range plan. The
    Company’s long-range plan is updated as part of its annual
    planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The
    discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of
    return required by a market participant whose weighted average
    cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk
    premium. While the Company uses the best available information
    to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual
    future cash flows or market conditions could differ
    significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to
    recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in
    assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions,
    the Company’s overall methodology and the population of
    assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate
    the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in
    the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical
    10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The results
    (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective
    reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10%
    decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Company’s
    reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values
    by 26% to 406% for each of the Company’s reporting units.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than
    goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a
    comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible
    asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment
    testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its
    indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty
    method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a
    widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value
    derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the
    discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such
    trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for
    their use.

The Company’s acquisitions have generally included a
    significant goodwill component and the Company expects to
    continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2010,
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled
    $1,818.3 million or 47.6% of the Company’s total
    assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment
    tests in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determined that the
    Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were
    not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or
    indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the
    future.

Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
    carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of
    other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired
    when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those
    assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss
    is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value
    exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value
    is determined primarily using present value techniques based on
    projected cash flows from the asset group.

•

Pensions.

The Company has U.S. and
    foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
    The most significant elements in determining the Company’s
    pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability
    discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The
    pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at
    which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation
    date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the
    assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities.
    In estimating this rate for 2010, the Company considered rates
    of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have
    maturities consistent



with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The
    discount rate used in determining the 2010 pension cost was
    5.90% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 5.98% for
    foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded
    status of the plans at December 31, 2010 and determining
    the 2011 defined benefit pension cost is 5.6% for
    U.S. plans and 5.71% for foreign plans. In estimating the
    U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Company’s
    actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to
    the plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on yields
    derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent
    maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets for 2010 of 8.25% for U.S. defined
    benefit pension plans and 6.97% for foreign plans. The Company
    will use 6.96% for the foreign plans in 2011 and expects to
    lower the U.S. plans’ rate to 8.0% in 2011. The
    Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based
    primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension
    plans’ investments. Additionally, the Company considers
    historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and
    equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed
    appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in
    determining the 2010 pension expense for the U.S. plans was
    3.75% and was 2.98% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of
    compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2011. The foreign
    plans’ rates of compensation increase will decrease
    slightly to 2.97% in 2011. For the year ended December 31,
    2010, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income
    of $3.2 million from its U.S. and foreign defined
    benefit pension plans as compared with pre-tax pension expense
    of $10.3 million recognized for these plans in 2009. The
    Company estimates its 2011 U.S. and foreign defined benefit
    pension pre-tax income to be approximately $7.9 million.

All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition
    obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been
    recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other
    comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be
    amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The
    Company uses a December 31 measurement date (the date at which
    plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its
    U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its
    defined benefit pension plans during 2010 which totaled
    $3.6 million, compared with $21.1 million in 2009. The
    Company anticipates making approximately $3.0 million to
    $5.0 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit
    pension plans in 2011.

Income Taxes.

The process of providing for
    income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts
    requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments
    regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a
    broad range of operations around the world and is therefore
    subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international
    taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes
    and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain.
    Management must make judgments currently about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax
    assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs,
    future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and
    liabilities may be necessary.

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax
    assets, taking into consideration the Company’s forecast of
    future taxable income, available net operating loss
    carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could
    be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this
    assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the
    amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s
    deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances
    change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances
    may be required.

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by
    applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is
    required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the
    financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a
    more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates
    is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax
    benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the
    highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be
    realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax
    examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based
    on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax
    audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or
    by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There
    can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be
    realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and
    audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
    accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.



Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASU

2010-06”).

ASU

2010-06

provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and
    require new disclosures related to fair value measurements,
    providing greater disaggregated information on each class of
    assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers
    between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair
    value measurements. The Company adopted the applicable
    provisions within ASU

2010-06

effective January 1, 2010. See Note 4 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further details. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact of adopting the level 3 disclosures of ASU

2010-06

that
    are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.

In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-09,

Subsequent Events

(“ASU

2010-09”).

ASU

2010-09

removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date in
    both the issued and revised financial statements for which the
    Company evaluated events that occur after the balance sheet date
    but before financial statements are issued or are available to
    be issued. ASU

2010-09

was
    effective as of February 2010.

In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-17,

Revenue Recognition — Milestone Method

(“ASU

2010-17”).

ASU

2010-17

establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered
    substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is
    achieved in research or development arrangements. In addition,
    it requires disclosure of certain information with respect to
    arrangements that contain milestones. ASU

2010-17

is
    effective for the Company prospectively beginning
    January 1, 2011. The Company has evaluated ASU

2010-17

and
    does not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on
    the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
    position or cash flows.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-29,

Business Combinations

(“ASU

2010-29”).

ASU

2010-29

addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the
    pro forma disclosure requirement for business combinations. ASU

2010-29

requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings for the
    current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all
    business combinations that occurred during the year had been as
    of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both the
    current and any comparable periods reported. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting the disclosure
    requirements of ASU

2010-29

that
    are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010.

Internal
    Reinvestment

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $39.2 million or 1.6% of sales in
    2010, compared with $33.1 million or 1.6% of sales in 2009.
    52% of the expenditures in 2010 were for improvements to
    existing equipment or additional equipment to increase
    productivity and expand capacity. The Company’s 2010
    capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on
    spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing
    capabilities. The 2011 capital expenditures are expected to
    approximate 1.6% of sales, with a continued emphasis on spending
    to improve productivity.

Product
    Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development and engineering costs
    before customer reimbursement were $112.1 million,
    $101.4 million and $115.9 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were $6.4 million, $5.5 million and
    $6.1 million, respectively. These amounts included net
    Company-funded research and development expenses of
    $56.8 million, $50.5 million and $57.5 million,
    respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the
    development of new products and processes and the improvement of
    existing products and processes.



Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company
    believes these waste products were handled in compliance with
    regulations existing at that time. At December 31, 2010,
    the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party
    (“PRP”) at 16

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a
    “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the
    low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the
    amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites,
    the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the
    de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting
    executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement
    amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company
    is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
    attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
    responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an
    appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where
    the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is
    participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved
    these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably
    expects this result will continue. In addition to these
    non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of
    providing reserves for probable remediation activities at
    certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing
    locations (the “owned” sites). For claims and
    proceedings against the Company with respect to other
    environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company
    has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This
    estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various
    stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and
    corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company
    has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has
    recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is
    reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the
    individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the
    amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements;
    however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to
    result in a material change to the consolidated financial
    statements. In estimating the Company’s liability for
    remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate
    share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of
    the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $31.3 million and $27.0 million, respectively,
    for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2010, the Company
    recorded $6.4 million in reserves, related primarily to a
    2010 business acquisition. These reserves relate to the
    estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at an
    owned site associated with the acquired business. Additionally,
    the Company spent $2.1 million on environmental matters in
    2010. The Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009 include reserves of
    $18.9 million and $19.2 million, respectively, for an
    owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of
    HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is the designated
    performing party for the performance of remedial activities for
    one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site
    in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has
    obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from
    the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required
    remedial activities. At December 31, 2010, the Company had
    $14.2 million in receivables related to HCC for probable
    recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
    third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the
    Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for
    approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain
    of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously
    owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or
    new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
    Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
    under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other
    parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental
    matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in
    all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for
    bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 and, as a result, the Company is
    performing investigation and remediation of a formerly owned
    site under a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are
    sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing
    claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe
    that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations
    in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon
    presently available information



and past experience related to such matters, an adequate
    provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost
    resulting from these actions is not expected to materially
    affect the consolidated results of operations, financial
    position or cash flows of the Company.

Market
    Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are
    fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
    and commodity prices, which could impact its results of
    operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its
    exposure to these risks through its normal operating and
    financing activities. The Company’s differentiated and
    global business activities help to reduce the impact that any
    particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a
    whole.

The Company’s short-term debt carries variable interest
    rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates.
    These financial instruments are more fully described in the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most
    significant exchange rate exposure are the Chinese renminbi, the
    Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso.
    Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and
    when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local
    borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign
    country affected. The effect of translating foreign
    subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is
    included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant
    effect on the operating results reported by the Company because
    revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally
    transacted in the same foreign currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure
    are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel,
    titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these
    commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in
    selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order
    pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes
    used to manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest
    rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the
    Company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in
    future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial
    instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual
    effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain matters discussed in this

Form 10-K

are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
    (“PSLRA”), which involve risk and uncertainties that
    exist in the Company’s operations and business environment
    and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or
    unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be
    important in determining the Company’s actual future
    results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe
    harbor” provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that
    numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in
    the future could cause, the Company’s actual results to
    differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
    statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not
    all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ from present expectations are set forth above
    and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no
    obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or
    otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

Management’s
    Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
    the consolidated financial statements and related information.
    The statements are prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently
    applied and include certain amounts based on management’s
    best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
    elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
    financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
    financial information, management maintains a system of internal
    accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
    program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
    division of responsibility and the application of written
    policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
    reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
    preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. We maintain
    a system of internal controls that is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and
    presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however,
    there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
    system of internal controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
    Company’s activities according to the highest standards of
    personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
    characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
    all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
    Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
    other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
    Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
    firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
    that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
    report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
    of the Company for its 2011 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
    registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
    direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an
    opinion as to whether management’s financial statements
    present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s
    financial position and operating results. This report is
    included on page 39.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in the Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the
    framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that
    evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2010.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, which appears on page 38.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We have audited AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 24,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
    equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 24, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis of
    Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
    operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
    (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the
    Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany
    transactions in the consolidation. The Company’s
    investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted
    for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not
    significant to the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Cash
    Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
    less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of the Company’s
    equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those
    of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as

“available-for-sale,”

although the Company may hold fixed-income securities until
    their maturity dates. Fixed-income securities generally mature
    within three years. The aggregate market value of equity and
    fixed-income securities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was
    $4.7 million ($4.5 million amortized cost) and
    $13.2 million ($13.5 million amortized cost),
    respectively. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such
    securities is recorded as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (in stockholders’ equity), and
    is not significant. Certain of the Company’s other
    investments, which are not significant, are also accounted for
    by the equity method of accounting as discussed above.

Accounts
    Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
    from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
    obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
    receivables is recorded against the amount due from these
    customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
    reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
    specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The
    allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $6.0 million and $5.8 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 9.

Inventories

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which
    approximates current replacement cost, for 69% of its
    inventories at December 31, 2010. The

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to
    determine cost for the remaining 31% of the Company’s
    inventory at December 31, 2010. For inventories where cost
    is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value
    over the LIFO value was $23.9 million and
    $20.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves
    for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current
    assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers
    who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related
    management initiatives.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
    for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
    lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies,
    and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
    incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
    principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable
    assets is generally three to ten years for machinery and
    equipment, five to 27 years for leasehold improvements and
    25 to 50 years for buildings.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
    when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when
    products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of
    an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have
    been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of
    sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery,
    the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer,
    assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The
    policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances, generally
    provides that the customer may not return products or be given
    allowances, except at the Company’s option. The Company has
    agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights
    of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the
    product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss
    transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer
    substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors
    other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for these
    sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is
    recognized in the income statement. Accruals for sales returns,
    other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at
    the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the accrual for future
    warranty obligations was $18.3 million, $16.0 million
    and $16.1 million, respectively. The Company’s expense
    for warranty obligations was $10.6 million in 2010,
    $8.2 million in 2009 and $12.2 million in 2008. The
    warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the
    Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed
    one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision
    based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made
    periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Research
    and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
    operations as incurred and were $56.8 million in 2010,
    $50.5 million in 2009 and $57.5 million in 2008.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and
    were $33.3 million in 2010, $24.6 million in 2009 and
    $34.0 million in 2008.

Earnings
    Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
    weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding
    during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per
    share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities
    (principally outstanding common stock options and restricted
    stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the
    calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per
    share was as follows for the years ended December 31:

Financial
    Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
    using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and
    their results of operations are translated using average
    exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company
    and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their
    functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those
    transactions are included in operating results for the year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
    instruments. Forward contracts are entered into from time to
    time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain inventory
    purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the Company’s
    exposure to raw material commodity price or foreign currency
    fluctuation. No forward contracts were outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 or 2009. In instances where transactions
    are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the gains and
    losses on those transactions are included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within
    stockholders’ equity to the extent they are effective as
    hedges. The Company has designated certain
    foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of
    the net investment in certain foreign operations. These net
    investment hedges are the Company’s
    British-pound-denominated long-term debt and Euro-denominated
    long-term debt, pertaining to certain European acquisitions
    whose functional currencies are either the British pound or the
    Euro. These acquisitions were financed by
    foreign-currency-denominated borrowings under the Company’s
    revolving credit facility and were subsequently refinanced with
    long-term private placement debt. These borrowings were designed
    to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign
    subsidiaries on their respective dates of acquisition. On the
    respective dates of acquisition, the Company designated the
    British pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as
    hedging instruments to offset foreign exchange gains or losses
    on the net investment in the acquired business due to changes in
    the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment
    hedges were evidenced by management’s documentation
    supporting the contemporaneous hedge designation on the
    acquisition dates. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument
    (the debt) following hedge designation, is reported in AOCI in
    the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment
    based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure
    hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, all
    net investment hedges were effective. At December 31, 2010,
    the translation losses on the net carrying value of the
    foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the
    translation gains on the carrying value of the underlying debt
    and the difference is included in AOCI. At December 31,
    2009, the translation gains on the net carrying value of the
    foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the
    translation losses on the carrying value of the underlying debt
    and the difference is included in AOCI. An evaluation of hedge
    effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis
    and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate. See
    Note 5.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,

Compensation — Stock Compensation.

Accordingly,
    the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its
    share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated
    financial statements over the requisite service period of the
    grants. See Note 12.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives,
    primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather,
    they are tested for impairment at least annually.

The Company identifies its reporting units at the component
    level, which is one level below our operating segments.
    Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific
    operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in
    which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting
    units are composed of the business units one level below our
    operating segment at which discrete financial information is
    prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow
    analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
    which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an
    appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market
    participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to
    determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sales
    transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the
    Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning
    future levels of revenue growth, operating margins,
    depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements,
    which are based upon the Company’s long-range plan. The
    Company’s long-range plan is updated as part of its annual
    planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The
    discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of
    return required by a market participant whose weighted average
    cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk
    premium. While the Company uses the best available information
    to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual
    future cash flows or market conditions could differ
    significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to
    recorded goodwill balances.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than
    goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a
    comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible
    asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment
    testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its
    indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty
    method. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty
    method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized
    from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to
    pay a royalty for their use.

The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in
    the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009 and 2008 and determined that
    the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with
    indefinite lives were not impaired.

The Company evaluates impairment of its long-lived assets, other
    than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets when events
    or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
    be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group
    is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted
    cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and
    are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is
    recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value
    exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
    Fair market value is determined primarily using present value
    techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
    Losses on long-lived assets held for sale, other than goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a
    similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for
    disposal costs.



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents are being
    amortized over useful lives of four to 20 years. Customer
    relationships are being amortized over a period of five to
    20 years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being
    amortized over a period of four to 20 years. The Company
    periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated
    useful lives of these intangible assets.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s annual provision for income taxes and
    determination of the related balance sheet accounts requires
    management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding
    outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad
    range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to
    complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing
    jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and
    potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain.
    Management must make judgments currently about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax
    assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs,
    future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and
    liabilities may be necessary. The Company recognizes interest
    and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in
    income tax expense.

The Company also is required to assess the realizability of its
    deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the
    Company’s forecast of future taxable income, the reversal
    of other existing temporary differences, available net operating
    loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that
    could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based
    on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and
    amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s
    deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances
    change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances
    may be required.

Stock
    Split

On November 2, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors
    declared a

three-for-two

split of the Company’s common stock. The stock split
    resulted in the issuance of one additional share for every two
    shares owned. The stock split was paid on December 21,
    2010, to stockholders of record at the close of business on
    December 10, 2010. Additionally, the Board of Directors
    approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate on
    the Company’s common stock to $0.06 per common share from
    $0.04 per common share on a post-split basis. All share and per
    share information included in this report has been retroactively
    adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.

Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASU

2010-06”).

ASU

2010-06

provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and
    require new disclosures related to fair value measurements,
    providing greater disaggregated information on each class of
    assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers
    between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair
    value measurements. The Company adopted the applicable
    provisions within ASU

2010-06

effective January 1, 2010. See Note 4 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the
    level 3 disclosures of ASU

2010-06

that
    are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.

In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-09,

Subsequent Events

    business combinations that occurred during the year had been as
    of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both the
    current and any comparable periods reported. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting the disclosure
    requirements of ASU

2010-29

that
    are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010.

Fair
    Value Measurement

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
    received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
    price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date.

The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the
    inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This
    hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
    follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2
    inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
    liability, either directly or indirectly through market
    corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on
    the company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and
    liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s
    classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
    lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

At December 31, 2010, $3.6 million of the
    Company’s cash and cash equivalents and marketable
    securities are valued as level 1 investments. In addition,
    the Company held $4.7 million of marketable securities in
    an institutional diversified equity securities mutual fund.
    These securities are valued as level 2 investments. During
    2010, the Company sold its level 2 investments in
    fixed-income securities. The marketable securities are shown as
    a separate line on the consolidated balance sheet. The
    fixed-income securities are included in the investments and
    other assets line of the consolidated balance sheet. For the
    year ended December 31, 2010, gains and losses on the
    investments noted above were not significant. No transfers
    between level 1 and level 2 investments occurred
    during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Fair value of the institutional equity securities mutual fund
    was estimated using the net asset value of the Company’s
    ownership interests in the fund’s capital. The mutual fund
    seeks to provide long-term growth of capital by investing
    primarily in equity securities traded on U.S. exchanges and
    issued by large, established companies across many business
    sectors. Fair value of the fixed-income securities was estimated
    using observable market inputs and the securities are primarily
    corporate debt instruments and U.S. Government securities.
    There are no restrictions on the Company’s ability to
    redeem these equity and fixed-income securities investments.

Hedging
    Activities

The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated
    long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain
    foreign operations. These net investment hedges are the
    Company’s British-pound-denominated long-term debt and
    Euro-denominated long-term debt, pertaining to certain European
    acquisitions whose functional currencies are either the British
    pound or the Euro. These acquisitions were financed by
    foreign-currency-denominated borrowings under the Company’s
    revolving credit facility and subsequently refinanced with
    long-term private placement debt. These borrowings were designed
    to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign
    subsidiaries on their respective dates of acquisition. On the
    respective dates of acquisition, the Company designated the
    British pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as

    (the debt) following hedge designation, is reported in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the

At December 31, 2010, the Company had $187.2 million
    of British-pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a
    hedge against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries
    acquired in 2008, 2006, 2004 and 2003. At December 31,
    2009, the Company had $145.5 million of
    British-pound-denominated loans, which were designated as a
    hedge against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries
    acquired in 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    the Company had $66.9 million and $71.6 million,
    respectively, of Euro-denominated loans, which were designated
    as a hedge against the net investment in a foreign subsidiary
    acquired in 2005. As a result of these British-pound- and
    Euro-denominated loans being designated and effective as net
    investment hedges, $9.9 million of currency remeasurement
    gains and $15.3 million of currency remeasurement losses
    have been included in the foreign currency translation component
    of other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively.

Fourth
    Quarter of 2008 Restructuring Charges and Asset
    Write-Downs

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax
    charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of
    reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.17 per diluted
    share). These charges included restructuring costs for employee
    reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well
    as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). The charges included
    $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the
    Company’s workforce and $1.5 million for lease
    termination costs associated with the closure of certain
    facilities. Of the $40.0 million in charges,
    $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million
    of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded
    in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in
    2008 segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in
    Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”),
    $19.4 million in Electromechanical Group (“EMG”)
    and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other
    expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and
    facility closures relate to plans established by the Company in
    2008 as part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly
    implemented across the Company’s various businesses during
    fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs resulted from the
    consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of
    production to low-cost locales and a general reduction in
    workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes
    in certain of the Company’s businesses.

Acquisitions

The Company spent $538.6 million in cash, net of cash
    acquired, to acquire Technical Services for Electronics
    (“TSE”) in June 2010, Haydon Enterprises in July 2010,
    Atlas Material Testing Technology LLC (“Atlas”) in
    November 2010, as well as the small acquisitions of Sterling
    Ultra Precision in January 2010, Imago Scientific Instruments in
    April 2010 and American Reliance’s Power Division in August
    2010. TSE is a manufacturer of engineered interconnect solutions
    for the medical device industry. Haydon Enterprises is a leader
    in linear actuators and lead screw assemblies for the medical,
    industrial equipment, aerospace, analytical instrument, computer
    peripheral and semiconductor industries. Atlas is the
    world’s leading provider of weathering test instruments and
    related testing and consulting services. Atlas is a part of EIG
    and TSE and Haydon Enterprises are part of EMG.

The operating results of the above acquisitions have been
    included in the Company’s consolidated results from the
    respective dates of acquisitions.

The following table represents the allocation of the aggregate
    purchase price for the net assets of the above acquisitions
    based on their estimated fair value (in millions):

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits
    the Company expects to realize from the acquisitions as follows:
    TSE expands the Company’s position in the medical device
    market and is an excellent fit with the HCC division, which
    manufactures highly engineered electronic interconnects and
    microelectronics packaging for sophisticated electronic
    applications. Haydon Enterprises’ product line complements
    the Company’s highly differentiated technical motor
    business, which shares common markets, customers and
    distribution channels, and places AMETEK in a unique position as
    the premier industry provider of high-end linear and rotary
    motion control solutions. Atlas has products which include
    weather exposure test systems, corrosion-testing instruments,
    specialty lighting systems, and large-scale weathering test
    chambers. In addition, Atlas offers indoor laboratory and
    outdoor testing services, photovoltaic and solar testing and
    consulting. Atlas provides the Company with another

growth platform in the materials testing equipment market and
    broadens AMETEK’s presence in the fast-growing photovoltaic
    testing market. The Company expects approximately
    $36.3 million of the goodwill recorded in connection with
    2010 acquisitions will be tax deductible in future years.

The Company is in the process of conducting third-party
    valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired.
    Adjustments to the allocation of purchase price will be recorded
    when this information is finalized. Therefore, the allocation of
    the purchase price is subject to revision.

At December 31, 2010, purchase price allocated to other
    intangible assets of $276.3 million consists of
    $80.6 million of indefinite-lived intangible trademarks and
    trade names, which are not subject to amortization. The
    remaining $195.7 million of other intangible assets consist
    of $159.7 million of customer relationships, which are
    being amortized over a period of 20 years and
    $36.0 million of purchased technology, which are being
    amortized over a period of 12 to 16 years.

In 2009, the Company spent $72.9 million in cash, net of
    cash acquired, to acquire High Standard Aviation in January
    2009, a small acquisition of two businesses in India, Unispec
    Marketing Pvt. Ltd. and Thelsha Technical Services Pvt. Ltd., in
    September 2009 and Ameron Global in December 2009. High Standard
    Aviation is a provider of electrical and electromechanical,
    hydraulic and pneumatic repair services to the aerospace
    industry. Ameron Global is a manufacturer of highly engineered
    pressurized gas components and systems for commercial and
    aerospace customers and is also a leader in maintenance, repair
    and overhaul of fire suppression and oxygen supply systems. High
    Standard Aviation and Ameron Global are a part of EMG.

The 2010 acquisitions noted above had an immaterial impact on
    reported net sales, net income and diluted earnings per share
    for the year ended December 31, 2010. Had the 2010
    acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2010, unaudited pro
    forma net sales, net income and diluted earnings per share for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 would not have been
    materially different than the amounts reported.

Had the 2010 acquisitions and the 2009 acquisitions been made at
    the beginning of 2009, unaudited pro forma net sales would have
    been $2,290.8 million and net income and diluted earnings
    per share would not have been materially different than the
    amounts reported.

Pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results
    that would have occurred if the acquisitions had been completed
    at the beginning of 2009.

In 2008, the Company spent $463.0 million in cash, net of
    cash acquired, for six acquisitions and one small technology
    line. The acquisitions include Drake Air (“Drake”) and
    Motion Control Group (“MCG”) in February 2008, Reading
    Alloys in April 2008, Vision Research, Inc. in June 2008, the
    programmable power business of Xantrex Technology, Inc.
    (“Xantrex Programmable”) in August 2008 and Muirhead
    Aerospace Limited (“Muirhead”) in November 2008. Drake
    is a provider of heat-transfer repair services to the commercial
    aerospace industry and further expands the Company’s
    presence in the global aerospace maintenance, repair and
    overhaul services industry. MCG is a leading global manufacturer
    of highly customized motors and motion control solutions for the
    medical, life sciences, industrial automation, semiconductor and
    aviation markets. MCG enhances the Company’s capability in
    providing precision motion technology solutions. Reading Alloys
    is a global leader in specialty titanium master alloys and
    highly engineered metal powders used in the aerospace, medical
    implant, military and electronics markets. Vision Research is a
    leading manufacturer of high-speed digital imaging systems used
    for motion capture and analysis in numerous test and measurement
    applications. Xantrex Programmable is a leader in alternating
    current and direct current programmable power supplies used to
    test electrical and electronic products. Muirhead is a leading
    manufacturer of motion technology products and a provider of
    avionics repair and overhaul

The Company’s revolving credit facility’s total
    borrowing capacity is $550 million, which includes an
    accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an
    additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at
    any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under
    certain conditions. The facility expires in June 2012. The
    revolving credit facility places certain restrictions on
    allowable additional indebtedness. At December 31, 2010,
    the Company had available borrowing capacity of
    $437.5 million under its revolving bank credit facility.

Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit
    facility are at the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate
    (“LIBOR”) plus a negotiated spread, or at the
    U.S. prime rate. At December 31, 2010, the Company had
    $92.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving
    credit facility. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no
    borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The
    weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility
    for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was 0.82%
    and 0.60%, respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of
    credit totaling $22.6 million and $19.8 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The private placements, the senior notes and the revolving
    credit facility are subject to certain customary covenants,
    including financial covenants that, among other things, require
    the Company to maintain certain

debt-to-EBITDA

and interest coverage ratios. The Company was in compliance with
    all provisions of the debt arrangements at December 31,
    2010.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
    facilities with local foreign lenders of $54.5 million at

Stockholders’
    Equity

In January 2010, the Board of Directors approved an increase of
    $75 million in the authorization for the repurchase of its
    common stock. This increase was added to the $68.5 million
    that remained available at December 31, 2009 from existing
    authorizations approved in 2008, for a total of
    $143.5 million available for repurchases of the
    Company’s common stock. In 2010, the Company repurchased
    approximately 3,071,000 shares of common stock for
    $78.6 million in cash under its current share repurchase
    authorization. The Company did not repurchase shares in 2009. At
    December 31, 2010, $64.9 million was available under
    the current Board authorization for future share repurchases.

At December 31, 2010, the Company held 7.3 million
    shares in its treasury at a cost of $153.6 million,
    compared with 4.7 million shares at a cost of
    $83.3 million at December 31, 2009. The number of
    shares outstanding at December 31, 2010 was
    160.7 million shares, compared with 161.8 million
    shares at December 31, 2009.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
    Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one
    Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the close
    of business on June 2, 2007, and has authorized the
    issuance of one Right for each share of common stock of the
    Company issued between the Record Date and the Distribution
    Date. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving
    acquisition of the Company’s common stock, that holders of
    Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be entitled
    (i) to purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified
    exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares of common stock
    of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of
    twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the Plan
    expire in June 2017.

Share-Based
    Compensation

Under the terms of the Company’s stockholder-approved
    share-based plans, incentive and non-qualified stock options and
    restricted stock awards have been, and may be, issued to the
    Company’s officers, management-level employees and members
    of its Board of Directors. Employee and non-employee director
    stock options generally vest at a rate of 25% per year,
    beginning one year from the date of the grant, and restricted
    stock awards generally have a four-year cliff vesting. Stock
    options generally have a maximum contractual term of seven
    years. At December 31, 2010, 8.3 million shares of
    Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the
    Company’s share-based plans, including 6.1 million
    shares for stock options outstanding.

The Company issues previously unissued shares when stock options
    are exercised and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the
    award of restricted stock.

The Company measures and records compensation expense related to
    all stock awards by recognizing the grant date fair value of the
    awards over their requisite service periods in the financial
    statements. For grants under any of the Company’s plans
    that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the
    Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period for the entire award.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the
    date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.
    The following weighted average assumptions were used in the
    Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair values of
    options granted during the years indicated:

Expected stock volatility is based on the historical volatility
    of the Company’s stock. The Company used historical
    exercise data to estimate the stock options’ expected life,
    which represents the period of time that the stock options
    granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates
    that the future stock option holding periods will be similar to
    the historical stock option holding periods. The risk-free
    interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the
    stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at
    the time of grant. Compensation expense recognized for all
    share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The
    Company’s estimated forfeiture rates are based on its
    historical experience.

As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately
    $14.1 million of expected future pre-tax compensation
    expense related to the 3.2 million nonvested stock options
    outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
    average period of less than two years.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Company’s
    restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of the
    number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the
    Company’s common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock,
    the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation)
    at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of capital in
    excess of par value in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over
    the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived
    service period as determined on the grant date.

Restricted stock awards are subject to accelerated vesting due
    to certain events, including doubling of the grant price of the
    Company’s common stock as of the close of business during
    any five consecutive trading days. On May 19, 2008, the
    April 27, 2005 grant of 1,059,908 shares (as adjusted
    to reflect a

three-for-two

stock split paid to stockholders on December 21, 2010. See
    Note 2.) of restricted stock vested under this accelerated
    vesting provision. The pre-tax charge to income due to the
    accelerated vesting of these shares was $7.8 million
    ($7.3 million net after-tax charge) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

The total fair value of the restricted stock that vested was
    $5.7 million and $17.8 million in 2010 and 2008,
    respectively, and 2009 was not significant. The weighted average
    fair value of restricted stock granted per share during 2010 and
    2009 was $29.01 and $21.83 (as adjusted to reflect a

three-for-two

stock split paid to stockholders on December 21, 2010. See
    Note 2.), respectively. As of December 31, 2010, there
    was approximately $20.9 million of expected future pre-tax
    compensation expense related to the 1.5 million nonvested
    restricted shares outstanding, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two
    years.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) in 2010, the Company reserved
    27,301 shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements
    and terminations were 3,599 shares in 2010. The total
    number of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was
    423,167 as of December 31, 2010. Charges to expense under
    the SERP are not significant in amount and are considered
    pension expense with the offsetting credit reflected in capital
    in excess of par value.

Leases
    and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases
    in effect at December 31, 2010 (principally for production
    and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to
    $97.1 million, consisting of payments of $19.6 million
    in 2011, $15.6 million in 2012, $11.5 million in 2013,
    $7.9 million in 2014, $6.8 million in 2015 and
    $35.7 million thereafter. Rental expense was
    $23.1 million in 2010, $22.8 million in 2009 and
    $22.7 million in 2008. The leases expire over a range of
    years from 2011 to 2082, with renewal or purchase options,
    subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of
    the leases.

The Company acquired a capital lease obligation in 2007 for land
    and a building. The lease has a term of 12 years, which
    began July 2006, and is payable quarterly. Property, plant and
    equipment as of December 31, 2010 includes a building of
    $11.9 million, net of $2.2 million of accumulated
    depreciation, and land of $2.0 million related to this
    capital lease. Amortization of the leased assets of
    $0.6 million is included in 2010 depreciation expense.
    Future minimum lease payments are estimated to be
    $0.9 million in each of the years 2011 through 2015 and
    $7.6 million thereafter, for total minimum lease payments
    of $12.1 million, net of interest.

At December 31, 2010, U.S. deferred income taxes
    totaling $5.7 million were provided on undistributed
    earnings of certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries

that are not expected to be permanently reinvested in such
    companies. There has been no provision for U.S. deferred
    income taxes for the undistributed earnings of certain other
    subsidiaries, which total approximately $284.3 million at
    December 31, 2010, because the Company intends to reinvest
    these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United
    States. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United
    States, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes
    and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had tax benefits of
    $11.4 million related to net operating loss carryforwards,
    which will be available to offset future income taxes payable,
    subject to certain annual or other



AMETEK,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This amount
    includes net operating loss carryforwards of $8.4 million
    for federal income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of
    $3.3 million, $2.7 million for state income tax
    purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.3 million, and
    $0.3 million for foreign income tax purposes with a
    valuation allowance of $0.1 million. These net operating
    loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2011 and
    2031. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had
    $2.0 million of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain
    deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to
    be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred
    tax assets established for net operating loss carryforwards. In
    2010, the Company recorded an increase of $0.7 million in
    the valuation allowance primarily related to state tax credits
    that will not be utilized due to net operating loss
    carryforwards.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had gross unrecognized
    tax benefits of $22.8 million, of which $18.3 million,
    if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax
    benefits of $26.5 million, of which $25.6 million, if
    recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to
    uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company reported
    $6.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related
    to interest and penalty exposure as accrued income tax expense
    in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    the Company recognized $1.9 million of expense,
    $0.7 million of income and $0.8 million of expense,
    respectively, for interest and penalties in the income statement.

The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the
    United States. The Company files income tax returns in various
    state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple
    legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open
    tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and
    six years in these jurisdictions. In 2010, the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) completed the examination of the
    Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2006 and 2007.
    In 2009, the Company concluded an exam in Germany for the period
    2004 through 2006. The Company has not materially extended any
    other statutes of limitation for any significant location and
    has reviewed and accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities
    for open periods. Tax years in certain state and foreign
    jurisdictions remain subject to examination; however the
    uncertain tax positions related to these jurisdictions are not
    considered material.

During 2010, the Company added $5.4 million of tax,
    interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and
    reversed $8.4 million of tax and interest related to
    statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.
    During 2009, the Company added $15.9 million of tax,
    interest and penalties related to 2009 activity for identified
    uncertain tax positions and reversed $4.8 million of tax
    and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of
    prior uncertain positions.

Retirement
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement
    and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
    covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
    generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of
    service

and/or

compensation. The following is a brief description of the
    Company’s retirement and pension plans.

The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
    benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
    trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
    Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined
    benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
    based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
    of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company
    estimates that it will make both required and discretionary cash
    contributions of approximately $3 million to
    $5 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans
    in 2011.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal
    year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension
    plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for
    eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the savings plan
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
    basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis up to six percent of eligible compensation or a maximum of
    $1,200 per participant.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined
    contribution retirement feature principally to cover
    U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after
    December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
    Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
    pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary
    subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the
    Company’s foreign operations participate in various local
    defined contribution plans.



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
    certain of its U.S. acquired businesses for the benefit of
    eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
    participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed six
    percent of the participant’s base compensation.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
    Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
    supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
    arrangements

and/or

a
    SERP covering certain current and former executives of the
    Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate
    the executive for retirement benefits that would have been
    provided under the Company’s primary retirement plan,
    except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be
    taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit
    obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be
    funded by a grant of shares of the Company’s common stock
    upon retirement or termination of the executive. The Company is
    providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the
    applicable periods.

The following tables set forth the changes in net projected
    benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the

The expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was
    8.25% in 2010 and 2009. Equity securities included
    861,300 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market
    value of $33.8 million (7.3% of total plan investment
    assets) at December 31, 2010 and 1,018,800 shares of
    AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of
    $26.0 million (6.0% of total plan investment assets) at
    December 31, 2009.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the plans’
    funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
    expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
    term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
    established. Since there may be periods of time where both
    equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an
    allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
    overall portfolio’s diversification and return potential.
    The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking
    into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
    streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
    actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
    established targets and ranges and is rebalanced when necessary.
    The target allocations for the U.S. defined benefits plans
    are approximately 50% equity securities, 30% fixed-income
    securities and 20% other securities

and/or

cash.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
    style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
    component.

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets
    is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
    assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
    portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
    guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
    interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in
    the footnote to the table above, certain investments are
    prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital,
    private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin
    trading, commodities, short selling and rights and warrants.
    Foreign currency futures, options and forward contracts may be
    used to manage foreign currency exposure.

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
    rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
    level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
    of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
    different asset classes, relative to the plans’ liabilities
    and how this can be affected by diversification, and the
    relative returns available on equities, fixed-income
    investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility
    of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are
    considered. It is expected that equities will outperform
    fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the
    trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may
    better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
    relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and
    the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to
    adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward
    equity



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed,
    from time to time, in view of changes in market conditions and
    in the plans’ liability profile. The target allocations for
    the foreign defined benefit plans are approximately 75% equity
    securities, 10% fixed-income securities and 15% other
    securities, insurance or cash.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
    developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
    the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
    assets. This review also considered current capital market
    conditions and projected future investment returns. The
    estimates of future capital market returns by asset class are
    lower than the actual long-term historical returns. The current
    low interest rate environment influences this outlook.
    Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans was
    reduced 25 basis points to 8.0% and foreign plans are 6.96%
    for 2011.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
    and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected
    benefit obligation in excess of plan assets and pension plans
    with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets

    represent amounts to be paid from pension trust assets. Amounts
    included that are to be paid from the Company’s assets are
    not significant in any individual year.

Postretirement
    Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
    pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former
    employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and
    are not significant.

The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
    certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
    retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
    employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
    retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
    compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
    invested in either, or a combination of, (a) an
    interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
    the general assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of
    a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common
    stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
    plan, including income earned, was $16.9 million and
    $16.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by
    the Company and is not significant.

Reportable
    Segments and Geographic Areas Information

Descriptive
    Information about Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, EIG and EMG. The
    Company manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments
    for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
    type, production processes, distribution methods and management
    organizations.

EIG produces instrumentation for various electronic applications
    used in transportation industries, including aircraft cockpit
    instruments and displays, airborne electronics systems that
    monitor and record flight and engine data, and pressure,
    temperature, flow and liquid-level sensors for commercial
    airlines and aircraft and jet engine manufacturers. EIG also
    produces analytical instrumentation for the laboratory and
    research markets, as well as instruments for food service
    equipment, measurement and monitoring instrumentation for
    various process industries and instruments and complete
    instrument panels for heavy trucks, and heavy construction and
    agricultural vehicles. EIG also manufactures ultraprecise
    measurement instrumentation, as well as thermoplastic compounds
    for automotive, appliance and telecommunications applications.

EMG produces brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass
    transit, medical equipment, computer and business machine
    applications. EMG also produces high-purity metal powders and
    alloys in powder, strip and wire form for electronic components,
    aircraft and automotive products, as well as heat exchangers and
    thermal management subsystems. EMG also supplies hermetically
    sealed (moisture-proof) connectors, terminals and headers. These
    electromechanical devices are used in aerospace, defense and
    other industrial applications. Additionally, EMG produces
    air-moving electric motors and motor-blower systems for
    manufacturers of floorcare appliances and outdoor power
    equipment. Sales of floorcare and specialty motors represented
    10.3% in 2010, 10.8% in 2009 and 12.1% in 2008 of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales.

Measurement
    of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
    and expenses (including certain administrative and other
    expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include an
    allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
    reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and
    profits, which are insignificant in amount. Reported segment
    assets include allocations directly related to the
    segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of
    investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits and deferred
    taxes.

    of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
    business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
    parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
    enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. The
    amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
    the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
    point in time. At December 31, 2010, the maximum amount of
    future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees
    was $59.3 million and the outstanding liability under
    certain of those guarantees was $5.9 million.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
    transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
    compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
    unfavorable financial consequences resulting from

specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or
    retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee
    liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not
    explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such
    indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount
    of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically
    stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
    indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
    Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims
    against them in connection with their positions with the
    Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims
    related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the
    Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any,
    under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a
    material impact on its consolidated results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Product
    Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
    sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
    vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the
    most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
    warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and
    adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
    expenses.

Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as
    follows at December 31:

Contingencies

Asbestos
    Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a
    defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of
    asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate
    to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not
    involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company
    or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which
    are under new ownership. In connection with many of these
    lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the
    case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these
    claims (the “Indemnified Claims”). The Indemnified
    Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such
    sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met
    their obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not
    have any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill
    their obligations in the future; however, one of these companies
    filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007. To date, no judgments
    have been rendered against the Company as a result of any
    asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong
    defenses to the claims being asserted and intends to continue to
    vigorously defend itself in these matters.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company is named a Potentially
    Responsible Party (“PRP”) at 16

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a
    “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the
    low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the
    amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites,
    the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the
    de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting
    executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement
    amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company
    is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
    attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
    responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an
    appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where
    the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is
    participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved
    these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably
    expects this result will continue. In addition to these
    non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of
    providing reserves for probable remediation activities at
    certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing
    locations (the “owned” sites). For claims and
    proceedings against the Company with respect to other
    environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company
    has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This
    estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various
    stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and
    corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company
    has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has
    recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is
    reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the
    individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the
    amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements;
    however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to
    result in a material change to the consolidated financial
    statements. In estimating the Company’s liability for
    remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate
    share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of
    the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $31.3 million and $27.0 million, respectively,
    for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2010, the Company
    recorded $6.4 million in reserves, related primarily to a
    2010 business acquisition. These reserves relate to the
    estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at an
    owned site associated with the acquired business. Additionally,
    the Company spent $2.1 million on environmental matters in
    2010. The Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009 include reserves of
    $18.9 million and $19.2 million, respectively, for an
    owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of
    HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is the designated
    performing party for the performance of remedial activities for
    one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site
    in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has
    obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from
    the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required
    remedial activities. At December 31, 2010, the Company had
    $14.2 million in receivables related to HCC for probable
    recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
    third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the
    Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for
    approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain
    of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously
    owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or
    new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
    Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
    under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other
    parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental
    matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in
    all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for
    bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 and, as a result, the Company is
    performing investigation and remediation of a formerly owned
    site under a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement.



AMETEK,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company believes it has established reserves which are
    sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing
    claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe
    that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations
    in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon
    presently available information and past experience related to
    such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been
    made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not
    expected to materially affect the consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and
    procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    information which is required to be disclosed is accumulated and
    communicated to management in a timely manner. Under the

    principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
    of our system of disclosure controls and procedures as required

    Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer have concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.

Such evaluation did not identify any change in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the year ended December 31, 2010 that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
