significant competitive advantages that help strengthen and sustain its market positions. Those advantages include:

Significant Market Share

.    AMETEK maintains significant market shares in a number of targeted niche markets through its ability to produce and deliver high-quality products at
competitive prices. EIG has significant market positions in niche segments of the process, aerospace, power and industrial instrument markets. EMG holds significant positions in niche segments of the aerospace and defense, precision motion control,
factory automation, robotics, medical and mass transit markets.

Technological and
Development Capabilities

.    AMETEK believes it has certain technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to maintain its leading market positions. Historically, it has demonstrated an ability to develop
innovative new products that anticipate customer needs and to bring them to market successfully. It has consistently added to its investment in research, development and engineering and improved its new product development efforts with the adoption
of Design for Six Sigma and Value Analysis/Value Engineering methodologies. These have improved the pace and quality of product innovation and resulted in the introduction of a steady stream of new products across all of AMETEK’s lines of
business.



Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing
Operations.

Through its Operational Excellence initiatives, AMETEK has established a lean manufacturing platform for its businesses. In its effort to achieve best-cost manufacturing, AMETEK has relocated manufacturing and
expanded plants in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, and Serbia. These plants offer proximity to customers and provide opportunities for increasing international sales. Acquisitions also have allowed AMETEK to reduce costs and
achieve operating synergies by consolidating operations, product lines and distribution channels, benefitting both of AMETEK’s operating groups.

Experienced Management Team

.    Another component of AMETEK’s success is
the strength of its management team and that team’s commitment to improving Company performance. AMETEK senior management has extensive industry experience and an average of approximately 23 years of AMETEK service. The management team is
focused on achieving results, building stockholder value and continually growing AMETEK. Individual performance is tied to financial results through Company-established stock ownership guidelines and equity incentive programs.

Business Strategy

AMETEK is committed to achieving earnings growth through the successful implementation of a Corporate Growth Plan. The goal of that plan is double-digit annual percentage growth in earnings per share over
the business cycle and a superior return on total capital. In addition, other financial initiatives have or may be undertaken, including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain foreign countries
and share repurchases.

AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key strategies:

Operational Excellence.

Operational Excellence is AMETEK’s cornerstone
strategy for improving profit margins and strengthening its competitive position across its businesses. Operational Excellence focuses on cost reductions, improvements in operating efficiencies and sustainable practices. It emphasizes team building
and a participative management culture. AMETEK’s Operational Excellence strategies include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, Design for Six Sigma and Value Engineering/Value Analysis. Each plays an important role in improving efficiency,
enhancing the pace and quality of innovation and cost reduction. Operational Excellence initiatives have yielded lower operating and administrative costs, shortened manufacturing cycle times, higher cash flow from operations and increased customer
satisfaction. It also has played a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies.

Strategic Acquisitions

.    Acquisitions are a key to achieving the goals of AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan. Since the beginning of 2010 through December 31, 2014,
AMETEK has completed 26 acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately $1.4 billion, including five acquisitions in 2014 (see “Recent Acquisitions”). AMETEK targets companies that offer the right strategic, technical
and cultural fit. It seeks to acquire businesses in adjacent markets with complementary products and technologies. It also looks for businesses that provide attractive growth opportunities, often in new and emerging markets. Through these and prior
acquisitions, AMETEK’s management team has developed considerable skill in identifying, acquiring and integrating new businesses. As it has executed its acquisition strategy, AMETEK’s mix of businesses has shifted toward those that are
more highly differentiated and, therefore, offer better opportunities for growth and profitability.

Global & Market Expansion

.    AMETEK has experienced dramatic growth outside the United States, reflecting an expanding international customer base and the attractive
growth potential of its businesses in overseas markets. Its largest presence outside the United States is in Europe, where it has operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Romania, Austria,
Switzerland and the Netherlands. While Europe remains its largest overseas market, AMETEK has pursued growth opportunities worldwide, especially in key emerging markets. It has grown sales in Latin America



and Asia by building, acquiring and expanding manufacturing facilities in Reynosa, Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Shanghai, China; and Penang, Malaysia. AMETEK also has expanded its sales and
service capabilities in China and enhanced its sales presence and engineering capabilities in India. Elsewhere in Asia and in the Middle East, it has expanded sales, service and technical support. Recently acquired businesses have further added to
AMETEK’s international presence. In recent years, AMETEK has acquired businesses with plants in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Serbia and China as well as acquired domestically located businesses that derive a substantial portion of
their revenues from global markets.

New Products

.    New products
are essential to AMETEK’s long-term growth. As a result, AMETEK has maintained a consistent investment in new product development and engineering. In 2014, AMETEK added to its highly differentiated product portfolio with a range of new products

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents we
incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our
control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and
future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic
businesses. Since the beginning of 2010, through December 31, 2014, we have completed 26 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we
have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:

•

Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;

•

The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on
favorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;

•

Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controls
of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;

•

Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;

•

U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;

•

Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;

•

Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

•

Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating
difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the
acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated
cost savings or benefits from, our cost reduction initiatives.

Our success is partly dependent upon
properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, our ongoing production and procurement initiatives, including the relocation of manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the
company more efficient, which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely
affect our business and operations.



Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with
international operations.

International sales for 2014 and 2013 represented 54.6% and 55.2% of our
consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. Approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured
outside the United States. We have manufacturing operations in 18 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic and Mexico. A prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these
countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations. International operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:

•

Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;

•

Overlap of different tax structures;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;

•

the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;

•

Restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

General economic conditions;

•

Unstable political situations;

•

Nationalization of assets; and

•

Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.

Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in
the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas, which may
adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external
reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial
statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.

Our international sales and operations may be adversely
impacted by compliance with export laws.

We are required to comply with various import, export,
export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances,
export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition,
failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.



Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees
could impede our ability to compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient
number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if
we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.

If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically
advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and
development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can
recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be
able to develop and successfully market new products.

Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this
technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Many of our products rely on proprietary
technology; therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights,
unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to
enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.

A shortage of, or price increases for, our raw materials could increase our operating costs.

While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices
for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, supplier’s allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price
levels. In addition, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore
could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the



costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous
materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites
designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture,
store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify
the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.
In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require
us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not
occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.

We are subject to numerous
governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are
subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be
adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.

We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is
alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed,
manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future
claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which
third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as
with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. EMG’s competition in specialty
metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limited
number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing
requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our
competitors.



Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our
ability to incur additional indebtedness.

Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt
agreements contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make
capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the
financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial
ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could
elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other
indebtedness.

Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business
disruptions.

Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems
may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, armed conflict, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. For
example, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunications or utility failures, or
other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, our distribution system, or our
information technology, telecommunications or other systems, could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, damage customer relationships and our reputation, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or
corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large repair and replacement expenses.

Our goodwill and other intangible assets
represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2014,
goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $4,239.6 million or 66% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and
other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall
significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant
portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Business Overview

AMETEK’s operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Company’s
strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated
operating results. In 2014, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational
Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2014 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEK’s four key strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global & Market Expansion
and New Products. Highlights of 2014 were:

•

In 2014, net sales were $4,022.0 million, an increase of $427.9 million or 11.9% from 2013, on contributions from the 2013 and 2014
acquisitions and internal growth of approximately 4% in the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and 2% in the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”) excluding the effect of foreign currency translation.

•

Net income for 2014 was $584.5 million, an increase of $67.5 million or 13.1%, compared with $517.0 million in 2013.

•

During 2014, the Company spent $573.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire five businesses:

•

In January 2014, the Company acquired Teseq Group, a leading manufacturer of test and measurement instrumentation for electromagnetic
compatibility testing;

•

In February 2014, the Company acquired VTI Instruments (“VTI”), a manufacturer of high precision test and measurement
instrumentation;

•

In May 2014, the Company acquired Luphos GmbH. Luphos’ core technology is used in the measurement of complex aspheric optical surfaces and
other surfaces through non-contact methods;

•

In June 2014, the Company acquired Zygo Corporation, a provider of optical metrology solutions, high-precision optics and optical assemblies
used in a wide range of scientific, industrial and medical applications; and

•

In August 2014, the Company acquired Amptek, Inc., a manufacturer of instruments and detectors used to identify composition of materials using

x-ray

fluorescence technology.

•

Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow provided by operating activities that totaled $726.0 million for 2014, a $65.3 million or
9.9% increase from 2013.



•

The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales, were
$2,196.2 million or 54.6% of net sales in 2014, compared with $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net sales in 2013.

•

New orders for 2014 were a record at $4,079.3 million, an increase of $457.4 million or 12.6%, compared with $3,621.9 million in
2013. As a result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2014 was $1,197.3 million.

•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $208.3 million in 2014 before customer
reimbursement of $8.9 million. Sales from products introduced in the past three years were $921.0 million or 22.9% of net sales.

•

In the third quarter of 2014, AMETEK completed a private placement agreement to sell $700 million in senior notes to a group of
institutional investors. There are three funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2014 for $500 million, consisting of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.73% senior notes due
September 2024, $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.83% senior notes due September 2026 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.98% senior notes due September 2029. The second funding date will be in
June 2015 for $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.91% senior notes due June 2025. The third funding date will be in August 2015 for $150 million, consisting of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of
3.96% senior notes due August 2025 and $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.45% senior notes due August 2035. The senior notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.88%. The proceeds from the first funding of the
senior notes were used to pay down all domestic borrowings under AMETEK’s revolving credit facility.

Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended
December 31, 2013

In 2014, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income,
net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from contributions from the acquisitions completed in 2014 and the acquisitions of Powervar, Inc. in December 2013, Creaform, Inc. in
October 2013 and Controls Southeast (“CSI”) in August 2013, internal sales growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives. The full year impact of the 2014 acquisitions and our continued focus
on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on our 2015 results while a stronger U.S. dollar is expected to be a headwind in 2015.

Net sales for 2014 were $4,022.0 million, an increase of $427.9 million or 11.9%, compared with net sales of
$3,594.1 million in 2013. EIG net sales were $2,421.6 million in 2014, an increase of 19.0% from $2,034.6 million in 2013. EMG net sales were $1,600.3 million in 2014, an increase of 2.6% from $1,559.5 million in 2013. The
increase in net sales for 2014 was attributable to higher order rates which drove internal sales growth of approximately 3% and acquisition growth of 9%.

Total international sales for 2014 were $2,196.2 million or 54.6% of net sales, an increase of $211.7 million or 10.7%, compared with international sales of $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net
sales in 2013. The $211.7 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above and higher sales growth, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain
strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $1,148.1 million in 2014, an increase of $111.1 million or 10.7%, compared with
$1,037.0 million in 2013. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2014 and 2013 acquisitions noted above, excluding Teseq and Creaform.

New orders for 2014 were a record at $4,079.3 million, an increase of $457.4 million or 12.6%, compared with
$3,621.9 million in 2013. The increase in orders for 2014 was due to internal order growth of approximately 4%, acquisitions added 10% and foreign currency translation was an unfavorable 1% effect. As a result, the Company’s backlog of
unfilled orders at December 31, 2014 was $1,197.3 million, an increase of $57.3 million or 5.0%, compared with $1,140.0 million at December 31, 2013.

Segment operating income for 2014 was $948.0 million, an increase of $86.5 million or 10.0%, compared with
segment operating income of $861.5 million in 2013. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions and internal sales growth mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Company’s Operational
Excellence initiatives, partially offset by $18.9 million in “Zygo integration costs,” comprised of $10.4 million in severance charges, a $4.5 million fair value inventory adjustment and $4.0 million in other charges,
related to the Zygo acquisition. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 23.6% in 2014, compared with 24.0% in 2013. The decrease in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the Zygo integration costs noted
above, partially offset by the benefits of the Company’s Operational Excellence initiatives.

Selling,
general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for 2014 were $462.6 million, an increase of $64.4 million or 16.2%, compared with $398.2 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.5% for 2014,
compared with 11.1% in 2013. Selling expenses for 2014 were $413.8 million, an increase of $61.6 million or 17.5%, compared with $352.2 million in 2013. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 10.3% for 2014,
compared with 9.8% in 2013. The selling expenses increase and the corresponding increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions. The Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire
differentiated businesses, which, because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs, tend to have a higher rate of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased approximately 4% for 2014 compared to 2013, which was in
line with internal sales growth.

Corporate administrative expenses for 2014 were $48.8 million, an
increase of $2.8 million or 6.1%, compared with $46.0 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.2% for 2014, compared with 1.3% in 2013.



Consolidated operating income was $898.6 million or 22.3% of net sales
for 2014, an increase of $83.5 million or 10.2%, compared with $815.1 million or 22.7% of net sales in 2013.

Interest expense was $79.9 million for 2014, an increase of $6.3 million or 8.6%, compared with $73.6 million in 2013. The increase was due to the impact of the initial funding of the
private placement senior notes in the third quarter of 2014 and higher borrowings under the revolving credit facility to help fund the recent acquisitions.

Other expenses, net were $13.8 million for 2014, a decrease of $2.9 million, compared with $16.7 million in 2013. The decrease was driven by an $8.0 million insurance policy gain in
the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by a $5.5 million reversal of an insurance policy receivable related to a specific uncertain tax position liability of an acquired entity in the third quarter of 2014.

The effective tax rate for 2014 was 27.4%, compared with 28.7% in 2013. Both years’ effective tax rate reflect the
improving mix of foreign earnings subject to tax at lower rates and a continued trend in lower state tax rates. The 2014 effective tax rate reflects a release of $12.9 million of uncertain tax position liabilities related to an acquired entity
due to the final closure of a tax year and foreign tax credit benefit on amounts repatriated during the year. On a comparative basis, the 2013 effective tax rate reflected the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development
(“R&D”) tax credit. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further details.

Net income for 2014 was $584.5 million, an increase of $67.5 million or 13.1%, compared with
$517.0 million in 2013. Diluted earnings per share for 2014 were $2.37, an increase of $0.27 or 12.9%, compared with $2.10 per diluted share in 2013.

Segment Results

EIG’s

net sales
totaled $2,421.6 million for 2014, an increase of $387.0 million or 19.0%, compared with $2,034.6 million in 2013. The net sales increase included internal sales growth of approximately 4%, primarily driven by increases in EIG’s
process instruments businesses, and the 2014 acquisitions and 2013 acquisitions of Powervar and Creaform added 15%.

EIG’s operating income was $613.0 million for 2014, an increase of $60.9 million or 11.0%, compared with $552.1 million in 2013. EIG’s increase in operating income was primarily
due to higher sales mentioned above, partially offset by the Zygo integration costs noted above. EIG’s operating margins were 25.3% of net sales for 2014, compared with 27.1% of net sales in 2013. EIG’s decrease in operating margins
resulted primarily from the Zygo integration costs noted above, partially offset by the benefits of the Group’s Operational Excellence initiatives. EIG’s 2013 operating margins included a $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility
recorded in third quarter, which was partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses recorded in the third and fourth quarters.

EMG’s

net sales totaled $1,600.3 million for 2014, an increase of $40.8 million or 2.6%, compared with $1,559.5 million in 2013. The net sales increase was attributable to
internal sales growth, driven by increases in EMG’s differentiated businesses.

EMG’s operating
income was $335.0 million for 2014, an increase of $25.6 million or 8.3%, compared with $309.4 million in 2013. EMG’s operating margins were 20.9% of net sales for 2014, compared with 19.8% of net sales in 2013. EMG’s
increase in operating income and operating margins was driven by the stronger performance in its differentiated businesses, which have higher operating margins than the Group’s floor care and specialty motors businesses.



Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with the year ended
December 31, 2012

In 2013, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income,
operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results primarily through contributions from acquisitions completed in 2013 and the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren GmbH in May 2012,

Micro-Poise

Measurement Systems

(“Micro-Poise”)

in October 2012, Aero Components International (“ACI”), Avtech Avionics and Instruments
(“Avtech”), Sunpower, Inc. and Crystal Engineering in December 2012, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives.

Net sales for 2013 were $3,594.1 million, an increase of $259.9 million or 7.8%, compared with net sales of $3,334.2 million in 2012. EIG net sales were $2,034.6 million in 2013, an
increase of 8.7% from $1,872.6 million in 2012. EMG net sales were $1,559.5 million in 2013, an increase of 6.7% from $1,461.7 million in 2012. The increase in net sales was attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of
the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2013 included internal sales growth of approximately 2%. Foreign currency translation was flat period over period.

Total international sales for 2013 were $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net sales, an increase of $276.9 million
or 16.2%, compared with international sales of $1,707.6 million or 51.2% of net sales in 2012. The $276.9 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above, primarily driven by Dunkermotoren and

Micro-Poise,

and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United
States, which are included in total international sales, were $1,037.0 million in 2013, an increase of $174.4 million or 20.2%, compared with $862.6 million in 2012. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2013 and
2012 acquisitions noted above, excluding Creaform and Dunkermotoren.

New orders for 2013 were a record at
$3,621.9 million, an increase of $86.8 million or 2.5%, compared with $3,535.1 million in 2012. The increase in orders was primarily attributable to 2013 and 2012 acquisitions. As a result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled
orders at December 31, 2013 was $1,140.0 million, an increase of $27.7 million or 2.5%, compared with $1,112.3 million at December 31, 2012.

Segment operating income for 2013 was $861.5 million, an increase of $72.2 million or 9.1%, compared with
segment operating income of $789.3 million in 2012. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Company’s lower cost structure through Operational
Excellence initiatives. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.0% in 2013, compared with 23.7% in 2012. The increase in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Company’s lower cost
structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.

SG&A expenses for 2013 were $398.2 million, an
increase of $17.7 million or 4.7%, compared with $380.5 million in 2012. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.1% for 2013, compared with 11.4% in 2012. Selling expenses increased $14.8 million or 4.4% for 2013
primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.8% for 2013, compared with 10.1% in 2012. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 2% for 2013 compared to 2012,
primarily due to cost containment initiatives.

Corporate administrative expenses for 2013 were
$46.0 million, an increase of $2.9 million or 6.7%, compared with $43.1 million in 2012. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher consulting and professional fees. As a percentage of net sales,
corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for both 2013 and 2012.

Consolidated operating income was
$815.1 million or 22.7% of net sales for 2013, an increase of $69.2 million or 9.3%, compared with $745.9 million or 22.4% of net sales in 2012.



Interest expense was $73.6 million for 2013, a decrease of
$1.9 million or 2.5%, compared with $75.5 million in 2012. The decrease was due to lower borrowings under revolving credit facilities.

Other expenses, net were $16.7 million for 2013, an increase of $8.8 million, compared with $7.9 million in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses and
professional fees, and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency in 2013.

The effective tax rate for 2013
was 28.7%, compared with 30.7% in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the higher proportion of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, as well as an improved state effective tax rate that reflects the ongoing benefit of
favorable planning initiatives. In addition, the retroactive extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for calendar year 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2013, resulting in an incremental R&D tax credit in 2013. See Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further details.

Net income for 2013 was $517.0 million, an increase of $57.9 million or 12.6%, compared with
$459.1 million in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $2.10, an increase of $0.22 or 11.7%, compared with $1.88 per diluted share in 2012.

Segment Results

EIG’s

net sales
totaled $2,034.6 million for 2013, an increase of $162.0 million or 8.7%, compared with $1,872.6 million in 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the acquisitions of Powervar, Creaform, CSI and

Micro-Poise.

Internal sales growth was approximately 2%, primarily driven by increases in EIG’s process instruments businesses. Foreign currency translation was flat period over period.

EIG’s operating income was $552.1 million for 2013, an increase of $55.0 million or 11.1%, compared with
$497.1 million in 2012. EIG’s increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EIG’s operating margins were 27.1% of net sales for 2013, compared with 26.5% of net sales in 2012. EIG’s increase in
operating margins was primarily due to the Group’s lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives. EIG’s 2013 operating margins included a $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility recorded in third quarter, which
was partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses recorded in the third and fourth quarters.

EMG’s

net sales totaled $1,559.5 million for 2013, an increase of $97.8 million or 6.7%, compared with $1,461.7 million in 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the
acquisition of Dunkermotoren. Internal sales growth was approximately 1%, driven by EMG’s floor care and specialty motors businesses. Foreign currency translation was flat period over period.

EMG’s operating income was $309.4 million for 2013, an increase of $17.2 million or 5.9%, compared with
$292.2 million in 2012. EMG’s increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EMG’s operating margins were 19.8% of net sales for 2013, compared with 20.0% of net sales in 2012. EMG’s decrease in
operating margins was driven by weaker performance in its differentiated businesses, including the impact of the Dunkermotoren acquisition, which has a lower operating margin than the Group’s base businesses.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $726.0 million in 2014, an increase of $65.3 million or 9.9%,
compared with $660.7 million in 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $67.5 million increase in net income, the $19.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization, the
$19.2 million increase in deferred income taxes and the $10.7 million decrease in gain on sale of facilities, partially offset by higher overall operating working capital levels necessary to grow the Company’s businesses. Free cash
flow (cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $654.6 million in 2014, compared with $597.4 million in 2013. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was
$1,022.6 million in 2014, compared with $916.3 million in 2013. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the “Notes to Selected
Financial Data” included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures to comparable

non-GAAP

measures).

Cash used for investing activities totaled
$641.6 million in 2014, compared with $460.3 million in 2013. In 2014, the Company paid $573.6 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Teseq in January 2014, VTI in February 2014, Luphos in May 2014, Zygo in
June 2014 and Amptek in August 2014. In 2013, the Company paid $414.3 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire CSI in August 2013, Creaform in October 2013 and Powervar in December 2013. The Company received
$1.0 million in 2014 and $12.8 million in 2013 from the sales of facilities, respectively. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $71.3 million in 2014, compared with $63.3 million in 2013.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $24.1 million in 2014, compared with $70.3 million of cash used
for financing activities in 2013. The change in financing cash flow was primarily the result of a net total borrowings increase of $326.6 million in 2014 to partially fund the 2014 acquisitions, compared with a net total borrowings decrease of
$44.9 million in 2013. In 2014, short-term borrowings decreased $172.5 million, compared with a decrease of $45.2 million in 2013. In 2014, long-term borrowings increased $499.1 million, compared with an increase of
$0.3 million in 2013.

In 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 4,755,000 shares of its common
stock for $245.3 million, compared with $8.5 million used to repurchase approximately 206,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in 2013. On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase of
$200 million in the authorization for repurchase of Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2014, $47.1 million was available under the Company’s Board of Directors authorization for future share repurchases.

Additional financing activities for 2014 include cash dividends paid of $80.6 million, compared with
$58.4 million in 2013. On May 8, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate on the Company’s common stock to $0.09 per common share from $0.06 per common share.
Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options were $17.8 million in 2014, compared with $26.1 million in 2013.

In the third quarter of 2014, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $700 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There are three funding dates for
the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2014 for $500 million, consisting of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.73% senior notes due September 2024, $100 million in aggregate principal amount
of 3.83% senior notes due September 2026 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.98% senior notes due September 2029. The second funding date will be in June 2015 for $50 million in aggregate principal amount of
3.91% senior notes due June 2025. The third funding date will be in August 2015 for $150 million, consisting of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.96% senior notes due August 2025 and $50 million in
aggregate principal amount of 4.45% senior notes due August 2035. The senior notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.88%. The senior notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among



other things, require the Company to maintain certain debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the first funding of the senior notes were used to pay down all domestic
borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

The Company has a revolving credit facility
with a total borrowing capacity of $700 million, which excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit
agreement under certain conditions. The revolving credit facility expires in December 2018. Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility are at the applicable benchmark rate plus a negotiated spread or at the
U.S. prime rate. The revolving credit facility provides the Company with additional financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy. At December 31, 2014, the Company had available borrowing
capacity of $771.2 million under its revolving credit facility, including the $200 million accordion feature.

At December 31, 2014, total debt outstanding was $1,714.0 million, compared with $1,415.1 million at December 31, 2013, with no significant maturities until the third quarter of 2015
of $150.8 million. The debt-to-capital ratio was 34.6% at December 31, 2014, compared with 31.1% at December 31, 2013. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and
stockholders’ equity) was 29.2% at December 31, 2014, compared with 26.3% at December 31, 2013. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the
Company. (See the “Notes to Selected Financial Data” included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable

non-GAAP

measures).

As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow
activities in 2014, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 totaled $377.6 million, compared with $295.2 million at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $352.8 million in cash outside the
United States, compared with $291.4 million at December 31, 2013. The Company utilizes this cash to fund its international operations, as well as to acquire international businesses. In January 2014, the Company acquired a Swiss company,
Teseq Group, for approximately 78 million Swiss francs (approximately $87 million). The Company is in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient
cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.

Subsequent Event

In January 2015, the Company contributed $50.0 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans.



The following table summarizes AMETEK’s contractual cash obligations
and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flows in future years at December 31, 2014.

(1)

The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 because the timing
of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further details.

(2)

Includes the $450 million private placement completed in 2007, the $350 million private placement completed in 2008 and the
$500 million private placement completed in 2014.

(3)

Although not contractually obligated, the Company expects to have the capability to repay the revolving credit loan within one year as permitted in
the credit agreement. Accordingly, $88.1 million was classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2014.

(4)

Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca SAS acquisition. The lease has a term of 12 years, which
began in July 2006, and is payable quarterly.

(5)

The leases expire over a range of years from 2015 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in
most of the leases.

(6)

Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

Other Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $44.1 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2014. Based on experience with these arrangements, the
Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a
significant impact on the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment. Because of the
uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Company’s accounting policies and to
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows



represents additional specific disclosures about the Company’s accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial
condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Company’s significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete.
This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable.
For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The Company’s policy, with
respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Company’s option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of
return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than
volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based
upon past experience. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $29.8 million and $28.0 million, respectively. The Company’s expense for warranty obligations was $10.5 million,
$8.6 million and $10.1 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty
expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals
may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific
customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of
time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The
allowance for possible losses on receivables was $10.4 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which approximates
current replacement cost, for approximately 80% of its inventories at December 31, 2014. The last-in,

first-out

(“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 20% of
its inventory at December 31, 2014. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $24.4 million and $23.3 million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial
difficulties and related management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

•

Business Combinations

.

The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when
applicable, the fair value of contingent consideration between tangible assets and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired businesses based on estimated fair values, with any residual of the purchase price recorded as
goodwill. Third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Estimating fair values requires significant judgments, estimates and
assumptions, including but



not limited to: discount rates, future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names, technology, customer relationships, property, plant and equipment, as well as income taxes. These
estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain.

•

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks
and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that
the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the
goodwill impairment test in the current year. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The first step in the quantitative process is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets to the
fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which
involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be
required to record any such impairment losses.

The Company identifies its reporting units
at the component level, which is one level below our operating units. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting
units are composed of the divisions one level below our operating units at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The
annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the
Company’s

long-range

plan. The Company’s long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall
after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount
rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and
market conditions, the Company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company
applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The 2014 results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair
values of the Company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 16% to 600% for each of the Company’s reporting units.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the
carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the
respective carrying values of those assets. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The



Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique
for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.

The Company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to
continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2014, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $3,111.5 million or 48.5% of the Company’s total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the
fourth quarter of 2014 and determined that the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.

Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a
loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.

•

Pensions.

The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most
significant elements in determining the Company’s pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the
pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2014, the Company considered rates of return
on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2014 pension cost was 5.0% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and
4.38% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2014 and determining the 2015 defined benefit pension cost was 4.2% for U.S. plans and 3.44% for foreign plans. In estimating
the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Company’s actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity
dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2014 of 7.75% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.93% for foreign plans. In 2015, the Company will use 7.75% for the U.S. plans and 6.92% for the foreign
plans. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans’ investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and
equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2014 pension income for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and was 2.92% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of compensation
increase will remain unchanged in 2015. The foreign plans’ rates of compensation increase will decrease slightly to 2.88% in 2015. In 2014, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $10.7 million from its U.S. and
foreign defined benefit pension plans, compared with pre-tax pension expense of $0.8 million recognized for these plans in 2013. The Company estimates its 2015 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax income to be approximately
$9.5 million.

All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations
or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses
a December 31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.



To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined
benefit pension plans in 2014, which totaled $5.7 million, compared with $5.9 million in 2013. The Company anticipates making approximately $54 million to $57 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in
2015. The estimated cash contributions range includes a $50.0 million cash contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in January 2015.

•

Income Taxes.

The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires
management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing
jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax assets and
liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Company’s forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available
tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s deferred tax assets. To the
extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax
position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and
record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined
based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately
be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)

No. 2013-05,

Parent’s
Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity

(“ASU 2013-05”).

ASU 2013-05

provides guidance for the treatment of the cumulative translation adjustment when an entity ceases to hold a controlling
financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. The Company adopted

ASU 2013-05

effective January 1, 2014 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In July 2013, the FASB
issued ASU

No. 2013-11

, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists

(“ASU 2013-11”).

ASU 2013-11

provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company adopted

ASU 2013-11

effective January 1, 2014 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation.



In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2014-08

, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity

(“ASU 2014-08”).

ASU

2014-08

revised guidance to only allow disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift (e.g., disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment,
or other major parts of an entity) and that have a major effect on a reporting entity’s operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. The revised guidance also requires expanded disclosure in the financial
statements for discontinued operations as well as for disposals of significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations presentation.

ASU 2014-08

is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The Company does not expect the adoption of

ASU 2014-08

to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. The objective of

ASU 2014-09

is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of

ASU 2014-09

is that an entity recognizes revenue at
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the new guidance, the Company must (1) identify
the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract’s performance obligations; and (5) recognize
revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

ASU 2014-09

applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification.

ASU 2014-09

is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be adopted by the Company using either a full retrospective or modified
retrospective approach, with early adoption prohibited. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts and monitor the developments related to

ASU 2014-09.

The Company has not determined the impact

ASU 2014-09

may have on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows nor decided upon the method of adoption.

Internal Reinvestment

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $71.3 million or 1.8% of net sales in 2014, compared with $63.3 million or 1.8% of
net sales in 2013. In 2014, 52% of capital expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Company’s 2014 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing
emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to approximate 1.7% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.

Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to, and has consistently invested in, research, development and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products. Research, development and engineering costs
before customer reimbursement were $208.3 million, $178.7 million and $154.8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $8.9 million, $9.2 million and $5.0 million,
respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $119.3 million, $93.9 million and $84.9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the
development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.



Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December 31, 2014, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party
(“PRP”) at 14 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the
Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In nine of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The
tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for
remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP
Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In
addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned” sites). For claims and
proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of
investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably
possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a
material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company’s liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs
to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were
$26.6 million and $21.9 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2014, the Company recorded $8.3 million in reserves, of which $3.6 million was related to a 2014 business acquisition. These reserves relate to
the estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at sites associated with the acquired business. Additionally, the Company spent $3.6 million on environmental matters in 2014. The Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities
at December 31, 2014 and 2013 include reserves of $11.7 million and $13.3 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is the designated
performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the
former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $9.3 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third
parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available



information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially
affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Market Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company’s differentiated and global
business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.

The Company’s short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso
and the Swiss franc. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected. The effect of
translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results
reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities are
generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange
rates, the Company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical
analysis.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain matters discussed in this

Form 10-K

are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
(“PSLRA”), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be
important in determining the Company’s actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in
the future could cause, the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events
or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of the consolidated financial statements and related
information. The statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and include certain amounts based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility
for the reliability of the financial information, management maintains a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit program. The system of controls provides for appropriate division of responsibility and the
application of written policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. AMETEK maintains a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however, there are inherent limitations in
the effectiveness of any system of internal controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting
the Company’s activities according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for all employees and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors who are not employees of the Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, the
internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The report of the Audit Committee is included in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Both the
independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an opinion as to whether management’s financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the Company’s financial position and operating results. This report is included herein.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, AMETEK conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.

In June 2014 and August 2014, the Company acquired Zygo Corporation and Amptek, Inc., respectively. As permitted by
related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff interpretative guidance for newly acquired businesses, the Company excluded Zygo Corporation and Amptek, Inc. from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In the aggregate, Zygo Corporation and Amptek, Inc. constituted 8.2% of total assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2.5% of net sales for the year then ended.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We have audited AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Zygo Corporation
and Amptek, Inc

.,

which are included in the 2014 consolidated financial statements of AMETEK, Inc. and constituted 8.2% of total assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2.5% of net sales for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting of AMETEK, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Zygo Corporation and Amptek, Inc.

In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 24, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc. (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the Company
and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions in the consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company’s investment in a fixed-income
mutual fund (held by its captive insurance subsidiary) is classified as “available-for-sale.” The aggregate market value of the fixed-income mutual fund at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $9.2 million ($9.9 million cost
basis) and $8.2 million ($8.6 million cost basis), respectively. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on the fixed-income mutual fund is recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (in stockholders’
equity), and is not significant. Certain of the Company’s other investments, which are not significant, are also accounted for by the equity method of accounting.

Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful receivables is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the
Company recognizes reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $10.4 million and $9.5 million at
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 7.

Inventories

The Company uses the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement
cost, for 80% of its inventories at December 31, 2014. The last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 20% of the Company’s inventory at December 31, 2014. For inventories
where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO value was $24.4 million and $23.3 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for
slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives.

Business Combinations

The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed from



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the
Company’s operating results from the date of acquisition. See Note 5.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their
useful lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies, and maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated principally on a

straight-line

basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable assets is generally three to ten years for machinery and equipment, five to 27 years for
leasehold improvements and 25 to 50 years for buildings.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized;
rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.

The Company identifies its reporting units at the
component level, which is one level below our operating units. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units
are composed of divisions and are one level below our operating units and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit,
which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sales transaction. The
annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the
Company’s long-range plan. The Company’s long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a
market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows
or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the
carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as
the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.

The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2014, 2013 and 2012 and determined that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
lives were not impaired.

The Company evaluates impairment of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the
carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on
projected cash flows from the asset group. Losses on long-lived assets held for sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Patents and technology are being amortized over useful lives of four to 20 years, with a weighted average life of 16 years. Customer relationships are being amortized over a period of five to 20 years, with a weighted average life of 19
years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being amortized over a period of three to 20 years. The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets.

Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their results of operations are translated using average exchange rates for the
year. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those transactions are included in operating results for the year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial instruments. Forward contracts are entered into from time to
time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain inventory purchases, export sales, debt or foreign currency transactions, thereby minimizing the Company’s exposure to raw material commodity price or foreign currency fluctuation. See
Note 3.

In instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the gains and
losses on those transactions are included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to the extent they are effective as hedges. The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as
hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, these net investment hedges included British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debt, pertaining to certain of its investments in 100% owned
subsidiaries whose functional currency is either the British pound or the Euro. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and
Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced by management’s
contemporaneous documentation supporting the hedge designation. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment
on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness. An evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate. See
Note 4.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement
of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company
recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The Company’s policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances, generally provides that the



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Company’s option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold
products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts.
The Company accounts for these sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time
revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $29.8 million and $28.0 million, respectively. The Company’s expense for warranty obligations was
$10.5 million in 2014, $8.6 million in 2013 and $10.1 million in 2012. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Research and Development

Company-funded

research and development costs are included in Cost of sales, excluding depreciation as incurred and were $119.3 million in 2014,
$93.9 million in 2013 and $84.9 million in 2012.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and were $49.0 million in 2014,
$41.9 million in 2013 and $39.0 million in 2012.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company expenses the fair value of share-based awards made under its share-based plans in the consolidated financial
statements over their requisite service period of the grants. See Note 10.

Income Taxes

The Company’s annual provision for income taxes and determination of the related balance sheet accounts requires
management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing
jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax assets and
liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and liabilities may be necessary. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
expense.

The Company also is required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into
consideration the Company’s forecast of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the
deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the
valuation allowances may be required.

In May 2014, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. The objective of

ASU 2014-09

is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of

ASU 2014-09

is that an entity recognizes revenue at
the transfer of promised goods or services to



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the new guidance, the Company must
(1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract’s performance obligations; and
(5) recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification.

ASU 2014-09

is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be adopted by the Company using either a full

Fair Value Measurement

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value.
This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs based on the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement.

The following table provides the Company’s assets that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, consistent with the fair value hierarchy:

The fair value of fixed-income investments, which are valued as level 1 investments,
was based on quoted market prices. The fixed-income investments are shown as a component of long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not significant. No transfers between level 1 and level 2 investments occurred during the year
ended December 31, 2014.

Financial Instruments

Cash, cash equivalents and fixed-income investments are recorded at fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table provides the estimated fair values of the
Company’s financial instruments liabilities, for which fair value is measured for disclosure purposes only, compared to the recorded amounts at December 31, 2014 and 2013:

The fair value of

short-term

borrowings
approximates the carrying value. Short-term borrowings are valued as level 2 investments as they are corroborated by observable market data. The Company’s long-term debt is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore,
the fair value of long-term debt was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments and is considered to be a level 3 liability. See Note 9 for long-term debt principal amounts, interest rates and maturities.

Foreign Currency

At December 31, 2014, the Company had no forward contracts outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2014, realized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts were not
significant. At December 31, 2013, the Company had two Euro forward contracts for a total notional value of 21.7 million Euro ($28 thousand fair value unrealized loss at December 31, 2013) and one 61.0 million Swiss franc
forward contract ($511 thousand fair value unrealized loss at December 31, 2013) outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2013, realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts were $0.1 million. The Company does not
typically designate its foreign currency forward contracts as hedges.

4.

Hedging Activities

The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the
net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December 31, 2014, these net investment hedges included British-pound-denominated long-term debt and Euro-denominated short-term debt. As of December 31, 2013, these net investment hedges
included British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debt. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred
to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges are evidenced by management’s contemporaneous documentation
supporting the hedge designation. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on
changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013,
the Company had $186.7 million and $198.9 million, respectively, of British-pound-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in British pound functional currency foreign subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had a $60.8 million and $68.9 million, respectively, Euro-denominated loan, which was designated as a hedge against the net investment in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As a result of
these British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans being designated and 100% effective as net investment hedges, $20.2 million of currency remeasurement gains and $6.8 million of currency remeasurement losses have been included in the foreign
currency translation component of other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Acquisitions

In 2014, the Company spent $573.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire Teseq Group
in January 2014, VTI Instruments (“VTI”) in February 2014, Luphos GmbH in May 2014, Zygo Corporation in June 2014 and Amptek, Inc. in August 2014. Teseq is a manufacturer of test and measurement
instrumentation for electromagnetic compatibility (“EMC”) testing. VTI is a manufacturer of high precision test and measurement instrumentation. Luphos’ core technology is used in the measurement of complex aspheric optical surfaces
and other surfaces through non-contact methods. Zygo is a provider of optical metrology solutions, high precision optics and optical assemblies for use in a wide range of scientific, industrial and medical applications. Amptek is a manufacturer of
instruments and detectors used to identify composition of materials using x-ray fluorescence technology. Teseq, VTI, Luphos, Zygo and Amptek are part of AMETEK’s Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”).

The following table represents the preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the net assets of the above
acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at acquisition (in millions):

*

Includes $33.9 million in accounts receivable, whose fair value, contractual cash flows and expected cash flows are approximately equal.

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits the Company expects to
realize from the acquisitions as follows: Teseq manufactures a broad line of conducted and radiated EMC compliance testing systems and radio-frequency amplifiers for a range of industries, including aerospace, automotive, consumer electronics,
medical equipment, telecommunications and transportation. Teseq provides the Company with opportunities for accelerating product innovation and market expansion worldwide. VTI broadens the Company’s capabilities in the high end test and
measurement market and provides additional technology differentiation. Luphos’ technology expands the Company’s metrology capabilities across a broader range of surface finishes and profiles. Zygo’s position in non-contact optical
metrology complements the Company’s position in contact metrology and enables the Company to offer its customers a full range of metrology solutions. Amptek broadens the Company’s position in the process and analytical instrumentations
markets. The Company expects approximately $6.3 million of the goodwill recorded in connection with the 2014 acquisitions will be tax deductible in future years.

The Company is in the process of finalizing the measurement of certain tangible and intangible assets and liabilities for
its 2014 Zygo acquisition, as well as accounting for income taxes associated with its 2014 acquisitions and the 2013 acquisition of Creaform, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2014, purchase price allocated to other intangible
assets of $270.7 million consists of $52.7 million of indefinite-lived intangible trademarks and trade names, which are not subject to amortization. The remaining $218.0 million of other intangible assets consist of
$170.6 million of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of five to 20 years, $0.8 million of trade names, which are being amortized over a period of ten years and $46.6 million of purchased
technology, which is being amortized over a period of 15 to 18 years. Amortization expense for each of the next five years for the 2014 acquisitions listed above is expected to approximate $12.3 million per year.

The 2014 acquisitions noted above had an immaterial impact on reported net sales, net income and diluted earnings per
share for the year ended December 31, 2014. Had the 2014 acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2014 or 2013, unaudited pro forma net sales, net income and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively, would not have been materially different than the amounts reported. Pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 2014 or 2013.

In 2013, the Company spent $414.3 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire Controls Southeast,
Inc. (“CSI”) in August, Creaform, Inc. in October, and Powervar, Inc. in December. CSI is a leader in custom-engineered, thermal management solutions used to maintain temperature control of liquid and gas in a broad range of demanding
industrial process applications. Creaform is a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative portable 3D measurement technologies and a provider of 3D engineering services. Powervar is a leading provider of power management systems and
uninterruptible power supply systems. CSI, Creaform and Powervar are part of EIG.

On January 2, 2013, the President of the United States of America
signed legislation that retroactively extended the research and development (“R&D”) tax credit for two years, from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. Similarly, on December 19, 2014, legislation was signed
that extended the R&D tax credit for one year through December 31, 2014.

At December 31, 2014
and 2013, U.S. and foreign deferred income taxes totaling $7.5 million and $2.4 million were provided on undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not expected to be permanently reinvested in such
companies. There has been no provision for U.S. deferred income taxes for the undistributed earnings of certain other subsidiaries, which total approximately $993.2 million and $854.8 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively, because the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United States. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes and
withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

At December 31, 2014, the Company had tax benefits of $10.8 million related to net operating loss
carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes net operating loss carryforwards of $1.7 million for federal
income tax purposes with no valuation allowance, $4.3 million for state income tax purposes with no valuation allowance and $4.8 million for foreign income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $3.3 million. These net operating
loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2015 and 2034.

At December 31, 2014, the Company
had tax benefits of $11.3 million related to tax credit carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes tax
credit carryforwards of $4.7 million for federal income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.7 million, $3.1 million for state income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.3 million and $3.5 million for
foreign income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $3.4 million. These tax credit carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2015 and 2034. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, the Company had $2.2 million of U.S.
foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax
assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for foreign and certain state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. In 2014, the Company recorded an
increase of $5.8 million in the valuation allowance primarily related to foreign net operating losses and tax credits that are not expected to be utilized.

At December 31, 2014, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $71.7 million, of which
$61.1 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. At December 31, 2013, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $55.2 million, of which $50.9 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax
rate.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company reported $11.1 million and $8.6 million,
respectively, related to interest and penalty exposure as accrued income tax expense in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized a net expense of $2.5 million, $0.4 million and $1.0 million,
respectively, for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statement of income as a component of income tax expense.

The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the United States Federal Income Tax. The Company files income tax returns in various other state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for

legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and six years in these jurisdictions. At December 31, 2014,
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been and is continuing to examine the Company’s consolidated U.S. income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011 in addition to the separate U.S. income tax return for Cameca Instruments, Inc.
for 2012. The IRS previously completed the examination of the Company’s consolidated U.S. income tax returns for the years 2008 and 2009. In addition, the IRS is currently examining the U.S. income tax returns of recently acquired Zygo
Corporation & Subsidiaries for their fiscal year 2012 and 2013 tax years. The Company has not materially extended any other statutes of limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and accrued for, where necessary, tax
liabilities for open periods including state and foreign jurisdictions that remain subject to examination. There have been no penalties asserted or imposed by the IRS related to substantial understatement of income, gross valuation misstatement or
failure to disclose a listed or reportable transaction.

During 2014, the Company added $35.0 million of
tax, interest and penalties to identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $16.0 million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions. During 2013, the Company added $29.7 million of
tax, interest and penalties related to identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $10.3 million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.

The following is a reconciliation of the liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31:

In 2014, the additions above primarily reflect the increase in tax liabilities for
uncertain tax positions related to certain foreign and domestic issues, while the reductions above primarily relate to statue expirations and tax paid. At December 31, 2014, tax, interest and penalties of $56.5 million were classified as a
noncurrent liability and $14.9 million was classified as a current liability, of which approximately $8.8 million was previously classified as a noncurrent liability. The net increase in uncertain tax positions for the year ended
December 31, 2014 resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of $1.9 million. At December 31, 2014, the Company classified $14.9 million of tax, interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a current liability as it is
reasonably possible that certain tax audits and tax rulings will be effectively settled within the next 12 months.

$64.2 million in 2016; $271.7 million in 2017; $310.7 million in 2018; $101.1 million in 2019; $124.5 million in 2020; and $555.6 million in 2021 and thereafter.

In the third quarter of 2014, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $700 million in
senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There are three funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2014 for $500 million, consisting of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.73%
senior notes due September 2024, $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.83% senior notes due September 2026 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.98% senior notes due September 2029. The second funding
date will be in June 2015 for $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.91% senior notes due June 2025. The third funding date will be in August 2015 for $150 million, consisting of $100 million in aggregate
principal amount of 3.96% senior notes due August 2025 and $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.45% senior notes due August 2035. The senior notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.88%. The senior notes are
subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and interest coverage
ratios. The proceeds from the first funding of the senior notes were used to pay down all domestic borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

The Company has a revolving credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of $700 million, which excludes an
accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The revolving credit facility expires
in December 2018. The revolving credit facility places certain restrictions on allowable additional indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $771.2 million under its revolving credit
facility, including the $200 million accordion feature.

Interest rates on outstanding loans under the
revolving credit facility are at the applicable benchmark rate plus a negotiated spread or at the U.S. prime rate. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company had $88.1 million and $216.6 million (including a $51.7 million eligible
foreign subsidiary borrowing), respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 1.36% and 1.70%,
respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $40.8 million and $47.7 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The private placements, the senior notes and the revolving credit facility are subject to certain customary covenants,
including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain

debt-to-EBITDA

and interest coverage ratios. The Company was in
compliance with all provisions of the debt arrangements at December 31, 2014.

Share-Based Compensation

Under the terms of the Company’s stockholder-approved share-based plans, incentive and
non-qualified stock options and restricted stock have been, and may be, issued to the Company’s officers, management-level employees and members of its Board of Directors. Employee and non-employee director stock options generally



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

vest at a rate of 25% per year, beginning one year from the date of the grant, and restricted stock generally has a

four-year

cliff vesting.
Stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of seven years. At December 31, 2014, 17.1 million shares of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company’s share-based plans, including
6.4 million shares for stock options outstanding.

The Company issues previously unissued shares when
stock options are exercised and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the award of restricted stock.

The
Company measures and records compensation expense related to all stock awards by recognizing the grant date fair value of the awards over their requisite service periods in the financial statements. For grants under any of the Company’s plans
that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a

Black-Scholes-Merton

option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in the

Black-Scholes-Merton

model to estimate the fair values of stock options granted during the years indicated:

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.
The Company used historical exercise data to estimate the stock options’ expected term, which represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the future stock option
holding periods will be similar to the historical stock option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. Compensation
expense recognized for all share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The Company’s estimated forfeiture rates are based on its historical experience.

Total share-based compensation expense was as follows for the years ended December 31:

Pre-tax share-based compensation expense is included in the consolidated statement of
income in either Cost of sales, excluding depreciation or Selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on where the recipient’s cash compensation is reported.

The following is a summary of the Company’s stock option activity
and related information for the year ended December 31, 2014:

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was
$25.7 million, $41.6 million and $45.5 million, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $8.9 million, $8.2 million and $8.9 million, respectively.

The following is a summary of the Company’s nonvested stock option activity and related information for the year
ended December 31, 2014:

As of December 31, 2014, there was approximately $16.2 million of expected
future

pre-tax

compensation expense related to the 2.5 million nonvested stock options outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than two years.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Company’s restricted stock arrangement is determined by
the product of the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock, the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation) at the date of grant is charged as a
reduction of capital in excess of par value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived service period as determined on
the grant date.

Restricted stock grants are subject to accelerated vesting due to certain events, including
doubling of the grant price of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business during any five consecutive trading days.

On January 25, 2013, 488,235 shares of restricted stock, which were granted on April 29, 2010, and 26,298 shares of restricted stock, which were granted on July 29, 2010,
vested under this accelerated vesting provision. The pre-tax charge to income due to the accelerated vesting of these shares was $2.7 million ($1.9 million net after-tax charge) for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The following is a summary of the Company’s nonvested restricted stock activity and related information for the year
ended December 31, 2014:

The total fair value of restricted stock vested was $3.6 million, $12.1 million

$26.2 million of expected future

pre-tax

compensation expense related to the 1.1 million nonvested restricted shares outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
less than two years.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) in 2014, the
Company reserved 26,362 shares of common stock. The net reduction for retirements, terminations and dividends was 3,651 shares in 2014. The total number of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was 605,359 as of December 31,
2014. Charges to expense under the SERP are not significant in amount and are considered pension expense with the offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par value.

Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of service and/or
compensation. The following is a brief description of the Company’s retirement and pension plans.

The
Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company estimates
that it will make both required and discretionary cash contributions of approximately $54 million to $57 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans in 2015. The estimated cash contributions range includes a $50.0 million
cash contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in January 2015.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal year
end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and
savings plan for eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the retirement and savings plan may contribute a specified portion of their compensation on a

pre-tax

basis, which vary by location. The Company
matches employee contributions ranging from 20% to 100%, up to a maximum percentage ranging from 1% to 8% of eligible compensation or up to a maximum of $1,200 per participant in some locations.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined contribution retirement feature principally to cover U.S.
salaried employees joining the Company after December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary subject to

pre-established

vesting. Employees of certain of the Company’s foreign operations participate in various local defined contribution plans.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual arrangements and/or a SERP covering certain current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement benefits that would
have been provided under the Company’s primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily
be funded by a grant of shares of the Company’s common stock upon retirement or termination of the executive. The Company is providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the applicable periods.

The following tables set forth the changes in net projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the
funded and unfunded defined benefit plans for the years ended December 31:

This asset class was invested in diversified companies in all geographical regions.

U.S. equity securities and global equity securities categorized as level 1 are traded on national and international
exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. For U.S. equity securities and global equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative
quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.

Additionally, some U.S. equity securities and global equity securities are public investment vehicles valued using the
Net Asset Value (“NAV”) provided by the fund manager. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding. U.S. equity securities and global equity securities are categorized as level 1 if traded at
their NAV on a nationally recognized securities exchange or categorized as level 2 if the NAV is corroborated by observable market data.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fixed income securities categorized as level 1 are traded on
national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year and categorized as level 2 if valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data, bids provided
by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.

Alternative investments
categorized as level 3 are valued based on unobservable inputs and cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. Investments in level 3 funds are redeemable, however, cash reimbursement may be delayed or a portion held back
until asset finalization.

The following is a summary of the changes in the fair value of the U.S. plans’
level 3 investments (fair value using significant unobservable inputs):

The expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was 7.75% in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Equity securities included 512,565 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of $27.0 million (5.4% of total plan investment assets) at December 31, 2014 and 550,837 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock
with a market value of $29.0 million (5.6% of total plan investment assets) at December 31, 2013.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the plans’
funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been established. Since there may be periods of time where both
equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the overall portfolio’s diversification and return potential. The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking into
consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the established targets and ranges and is rebalanced when necessary. The
target allocations for the U.S. defined benefits plans are approximately 45% equity securities, 15% fixed-income securities and 40% other securities and/or cash.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and style. The equity portfolio also includes international
components.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets is to
provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the assets and to provide diversification. The

fixed-income

portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity guidelines in an attempt to minimize
the adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, certain
investments are prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital, private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading, commodities, short selling and rights and warrants. Foreign currency futures, options and forward
contracts may be used to manage foreign currency exposure.

The following is a summary of the fair value of
plan assets for foreign defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Equity funds, real estate funds and fixed income funds that are valued by the vendor
using observable market inputs are considered level 2 investments. Life insurance assets are considered level 3 investments as their values are determined by the sponsor using unobservable market data.

The following is a summary of the changes in the fair value of the foreign plans’ level 3 investments (fair
value determined using significant unobservable inputs):



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit plans’
investment strategy is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to
balance risks against the current and future needs of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the different asset classes, relative to the plans’ liabilities and how this can be affected by diversification, and the relative
returns available on equities, fixed-income investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are considered. It is expected that equities will outperform fixed-income
investments over the long term. However, the trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and the immature
nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed, from time to time, in view of changes in market conditions and in
the plans’ liability profile. The actual and target allocations for the foreign defined benefit plans are approximately 70% equity securities, 15% fixed-income securities and 15% other securities, insurance or cash.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was developed based on a review of historical investment returns
for the investment categories for the defined benefit pension assets. This review also considered current capital market conditions and projected future investment returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset class are lower than
the actual long-term historical returns. The current low interest rate environment influences this outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans is 7.75% and 6.92% for foreign plans in 2015.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a
projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets and pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were as follows at December 31:

service costs is expected to be $8.8 million.

The following weighted average assumptions were used to
determine the above net periodic pension benefit expense for the years ended December 31:

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The estimated future benefit payments for U.S. and foreign plans are as follows: 2015

- $33.4 million;

2016 - $34.1 million;

2017 - $35.5 million;

2018 - $36.5 million;

2019 - $37.3 million;

2020 to

2024 - $199.8 million.

Future benefit
payments primarily represent amounts to be paid from pension trust assets. Amounts included that are to be paid from the Company’s assets are not significant in any individual year.

Postretirement Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The
Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and are not significant.

The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for certain former or inactive employees after employment but
before retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation
plan, which allows employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed invested in either, or a combination of,
(a) an interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of the general assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common stock on behalf of the employee. The amount
deferred under the plan, including income earned, was $21.2 million and $19.7 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Administrative expense for the deferred compensation plan is borne by the Company and is not
significant.

Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. The Company primarily issues
guarantees,

stand-by

letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its business to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to
support or enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular point in time. At December 31, 2014, the
maximum amount of future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees was $79.1 million and the outstanding liability under certain of those guarantees was $11.4 million.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences
resulting from specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the
obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be
reasonably estimated. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims against them in connection with their positions with the Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications
have been minimal for the Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any, under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Product Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the most part do not
exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as follows at December 31:

Certain settlements of warranties made during the period were for specific nonrecurring
warranty obligations. Product warranty obligations are reported as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

Contingencies

Asbestos Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate to businesses which
were acquired by the Company and do not involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which are under new ownership. In connection with many of these lawsuits, the sellers or
new owners of such businesses, as the case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these claims (the “Indemnified Claims”). The Indemnified Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such sellers and new owners.
These sellers and new owners have met their obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not have any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their obligations in the future; however, one of these companies filed for bankruptcy
liquidation in 2007. To date, no judgments have been rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the claims being asserted and intends to continue to vigorously defend
itself in these matters.

Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At December 31, 2014, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) at 14 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the “non-owned” sites).
The Company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In nine of these sites, the Company has reached a
tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to
investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a
non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s expected obligations. The Company
historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation
activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned” sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has
determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has
developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts
accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company’s liability for remediation, the
Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.



AMETEK, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were
$26.6 million and $21.9 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2014, the Company recorded $8.3 million in reserves, of which $3.6 million was related to a 2014 business acquisition. These reserves relate to
the estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at sites associated with the acquired business. Additionally, the Company spent $3.6 million on environmental matters in 2014. The Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities
at December 31, 2014 and 2013 include reserves of $11.7 million and $13.3 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is the designated
performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the
former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $9.3 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third
parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the
ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Leases and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases in effect at December 31, 2014
(principally for production and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to $158.3 million, consisting of payments of $36.0 million in 2015, $27.4 million in 2016, $18.6 million in 2017, $14.4 million in 2018,
$11.7 million in 2019 and $50.2 million thereafter. The leases expire over a range of years from 2015 to 2082, with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases. Rental expense was
$44.6 million in 2014, $39.5 million in 2013 and $28.0 million in 2012.

As of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $388.7 million and $335.0 million, respectively, in purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

Measurement of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents net sales less all direct costs and expenses (including certain administrative and
other expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include interest expense. Net sales by segment are reported after elimination of intra- and intersegment sales and profits, which are insignificant in amount. Reported segment assets include
allocations directly related to the segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits and deferred taxes.
