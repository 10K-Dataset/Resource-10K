Products
    and Services

The Company markets its products worldwide through two operating
    groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and
    the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). EIG builds
    monitoring, testing, calibration and display devices for the
    process, aerospace, industrial and power markets. EMG is a
    supplier of electromechanical devices. EMG produces highly
    engineered electromechanical connectors for hermetic
    (moisture-proof) applications, specialty metals for niche
    markets and brushless air-moving motors, blowers and heat
    exchangers. End markets include aerospace, defense, mass
    transit, medical, office products and other industrial markets.
    The Company believes that EMG is the world’s largest
    manufacturer of air-moving electric motors for vacuum cleaners
    and is a prominent producer of motors for other floor care
    products. The Company continues to grow through strategic
    acquisitions focused on differentiated niche markets in
    instrumentation and electromechanical devices.

Competitive
    Strengths

Management believes that the Company has several significant
    competitive advantages that assist it in sustaining and
    enhancing its market positions. Its principal strengths include:

Significant Market Share.

AMETEK maintains a
    significant share in many of its targeted niche markets because
    of its ability to produce and deliver high-quality products at
    competitive prices. In EIG, the Company maintains significant
    market positions in many niche segments within the process,
    aerospace, industrial and power instrumentation markets. In EMG,
    the Company maintains significant market positions in many niche
    segments including aerospace, defense, mass transit, medical,
    office products and air-moving motors for the floor care market.

Technological and Development
    Capabilities.

AMETEK believes it has certain
    technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to
    develop innovative products and maintain leading market
    positions. Historically, the Company has grown by extending its
    technical expertise into the manufacture of customized products
    for its customers, as well as through strategic acquisitions.
    EIG competes primarily on the basis of product innovation in
    several highly specialized instrumentation markets, including
    process measurement, aerospace, power and heavy-vehicle
    dashboard instrumentation. EMG’s differentiated businesses
    focus on



developing customized products for specialized applications in
    aerospace and defense, medical, business machines and other
    industrial applications. In its cost-driven motor business, EMG
    focuses on low-cost design and manufacturing, while enhancing
    motor-blower performance through advances in power, efficiency,
    lighter weight and quieter operation.

Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing
    Operations.

EMG has motor manufacturing plants in
    China, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Brazil to lower its costs
    and achieve strategic proximity to its customers, providing the
    opportunity to increase international sales and market share.
    Certain of the Company’s electronic instrument businesses
    are also relocating manufacturing operations to low-cost
    locales. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and joint ventures
    in Europe, North America and Asia have resulted in additional
    cost savings and synergies through the consolidation of
    operations, product lines and distribution channels, which
    benefits both operating groups.

Experienced Management Team.

Another key
    component of AMETEK’s success is the strength of its
    management team and its commitment to the performance of the
    Company. AMETEK’s senior management has extensive
    experience, averaging approximately 23 years with the
    Company, and is financially committed to the Company’s
    success through Company-established stock ownership guidelines
    and equity incentive programs.

Business
    Strategy

AMETEK’s objectives are to increase the Company’s
    earnings and financial returns through a combination of
    operational and financial strategies. Those operational
    strategies include business acquisitions, new product
    development, global and market expansion and Operational
    Excellence programs designed to achieve double-digit annual
    percentage growth in earnings per share over the business cycle
    and a superior return on total capital. To support those
    operational objectives, financial initiatives have been, or may
    be, undertaken, including public and private debt or equity
    issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain
    foreign countries, accounts receivable securitization and share
    repurchases. AMETEK’s commitment to earnings growth is
    reflected in its continued implementation of cost-reduction
    programs designed to achieve the Company’s long-term
    best-cost objectives.

AMETEK’s Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key
    strategies:

Operational Excellence.

Operational Excellence
    is AMETEK’s cornerstone strategy for improving profit
    margins and strengthening the Company’s competitive
    position across its businesses. Through its Operational
    Excellence strategy, the Company seeks to reduce production
    costs and improve its market positions. The strategy has played
    a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies.
    AMETEK believes that Operational Excellence, which focuses on
    Six Sigma process improvements, global sourcing and lean
    manufacturing and also emphasizes team building and a
    participative management culture, has enabled the Company to
    improve operating efficiencies and product quality, increase
    customer satisfaction and yield higher cash flow from
    operations, while lowering operating and administrative costs
    and shortening manufacturing cycle times.

New Product Development.

One of AMETEK’s
    greatest strengths is the ability to develop innovative new
    products and bring them to market successfully. Recent product

Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The
    Company continues to pursue strategic acquisitions, both
    domestically and internationally, to expand and strengthen its
    product lines, improve its market share positions and increase
    earnings through sales growth and operational efficiencies at
    the acquired businesses. Since the beginning of 2004, through
    December 31, 2008, the Company has completed 23
    acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately
    $1.0 billion, including 6 acquisitions in 2008 representing
    approximately $290 million in annualized sales (see
    “Recent Acquisitions”). Those acquisitions have
    enhanced AMETEK’s position in analytical instrumentation,
    aerospace, and electrical interconnects and packaging. Through
    these and prior acquisitions, the Company’s management team
    has gained considerable experience in successfully acquiring and
    integrating new businesses. The Company intends to continue to
    pursue this acquisition strategy.

    Overview

Operating
    Performance

In 2008, AMETEK generated sales of $2.5 billion, an
    increase of 18% from 2007, and increased net income by 8%. The
    Company set records for sales, operating income, net income and
    diluted earnings per share. This strong performance was driven
    by strong internal growth in each of the Company’s two
    reportable segments, the contribution of recently acquired
    businesses and the Company’s continuing cost reduction
    initiatives.

Financing

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September
    2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in
    aggregate principal amount of



6.59% senior notes due September 2015 and $160 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.08% senior notes due
    September 2018. The second funding date occurred in December
    2008 for $100 million, consisting of $35 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.69% senior notes due
    December 2015 and $65 million in aggregate principal amount
    of 7.18% senior notes due December 2018. The senior notes
    carry a weighted average interest rate of 6.93%. The proceeds
    from the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the
    borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit
    facility.

In July 2008, the Company repaid the $225 million
    7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from
    borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility. Also in
    July 2008, the Company obtained the second funding of
    $80 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.35% senior notes due July 2018 under the 2007 private
    placement agreement, which completed the sale of
    $450 million in senior notes to a group of institutional
    investors. The first funding of the 2007 private placement
    occurred in December 2007 for $370 million, consisting of
    $270 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due
    December 2019.

The accounts receivable securitization facility was amended and
    restated in May 2008, extending the expiration date from May
    2008 to May 2009, and bringing the borrowing capacity to
    $100 million, from $110 million previously.

    OEMs of floor care products. EMG designs products that, in many
    instances, are significantly different from, or technologically
    better than, competing products. It has reduced costs by
    implementing operational improvements, achieving acquisition
    synergies, improving supply chain management, moving production
    to low-cost locales and reducing headcount. 43% of EMG’s
    2008 sales were to customers outside the United States.

At December 31, 2008, EMG employed approximately
    5,600 people, of whom approximately 2,300 were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements (including some that are
    covered by local unions). EMG had 51 manufacturing facilities:
    28 in the United States, 12 in the United Kingdom, three in
    France, two each in Italy, Mexico and the Czech Republic and one
    each in China and Brazil at December 31, 2008.

Differentiated
    Businesses

Differentiated businesses account for an increasing proportion
    of EMG’s overall sales base. Differentiated businesses
    represented 73% of EMG’s sales in 2008 and are comprised of
    the technical motors and systems businesses and the engineered
    materials, interconnects and packaging businesses.

Technical
    Motors and Systems Markets and Products

Technical motors and systems, representing 40% of EMG’s
    2008 sales, consist of brushless motors, blowers and pumps, as
    well as other electromechanical systems. These products are used
    in aerospace and defense, business machines, computer equipment,
    mass transit vehicles, medical equipment, power, and industrial
    applications.

EMG produces electronically commutated (brushless) motors,
    blowers and pumps that offer long life, reliability and near
    maintenance-free operation. These motor-blower systems and heat
    exchangers are used for thermal management and other
    applications on a wide variety of military and commercial
    aircraft and military ground vehicles, and are used increasingly
    in medical and other applications, in which their long life, and
    spark-free and reliable operation is very important. These
    motors provide cooling and ventilation for business machines,
    computers and mass transit vehicles.

EMG’s Prestolite switch business produces solenoids and
    other electromechanical devices for the motive and stationary
    power markets. The Prestolite battery charger business
    manufactures high-quality industrial battery chargers for use in
    the materials handling market. Both the switch and battery
    charger businesses have strong market positions and enjoy a
    reputation for high quality and service.

Engineered
    Materials, Interconnects and Packaging Markets and
    Products

33% of EMG’s 2008 sales are engineered materials,
    interconnects and packaging products. AMETEK is an innovator and
    market leader in specialized metal powder, strip, wire and
    bonded products. It produces stainless steel and nickel clad
    alloys; stainless steel, cobalt and nickel alloy powders; metal
    strip; specialty shaped and electronic wire; and advanced metal
    matrix composites used in electronic thermal management. Its
    products are used in automotive, appliance, medical and
    surgical, aerospace, telecommunications, marine and general
    industrial applications. Its niche market focus is based upon
    proprietary manufacturing technology and strong customer
    relationships.

Reading Alloys, acquired in April 2008, is a niche specialty
    metals producer. It produces titanium master alloys and expands
    our position in customized titanium products. Reading Alloys
    adds to our capabilities in strip and foil products used in
    medical devices, electronic components and aerospace
    instruments. Its metal powder production techniques complement
    our existing gas and water atomization capabilities.

Hamilton Precision Metals, Inc., acquired in June 2007, produces
    precision metal strip and foil for niche markets such as metals
    used in medical implant devices and surgical instruments,
    electronic components and measurement devices for aerospace and
    other industrial markets.

Seacon Phoenix, subsequently renamed AMETEK SCP, Inc., acquired
    in April 2007, produces undersea electrical interconnect
    subsystems for the global submarine market. It added to the
    Company’s position in highly engineered hermetically sealed
    electrical interconnects and microelectronics packaging used to
    protect sophisticated electronics in aerospace, defense,
    telecommunications and industrial applications.

Floor
    Care and Specialty Motor Markets and Products

27% of EMG’s 2008 sales are to floor care and
    specialty motor markets, where it has the leading share, through
    its sales of air-moving electric motors to most of the
    world’s major floor care OEMs, including vertically
    integrated OEMs that produce some of their own motors. EMG
    produces motor-blowers for a full range of floor care products,
    ranging from hand-held, canister and upright vacuums to central
    vacuums for residential use. High-performance vacuum motors also
    are marketed for commercial and industrial applications.

The Company also manufactures a variety of specialty motors used
    in a wide range of products, such as household and personal care
    appliances; fitness equipment; electric materials handling
    vehicles; and sewing machines. Additionally, its products are
    used in outdoor power equipment, such as electric chain saws,
    leaf blowers, string trimmers and power washers.

EMG has been successful in directing a portion of its global
    floor care marketing at vertically integrated vacuum cleaner
    manufacturers, who seek to outsource all or part of their motor
    production. By purchasing their motors from EMG, these customers
    are able to realize economic and operational advantages by
    reducing or discontinuing their own motor production and
    avoiding the capital investment required to keep their motor
    manufacturing current with changing technologies and market
    demands.

New
    Product Development

EMG focuses its new product development on reducing costs and
    achieving performance enhancements for its advanced motors and
    blowers, electrical connectors and microelectronics packaging;
    motion control products; industrial battery chargers and heat
    exchangers; and specialty metal alloys and powders. These
    include the latest versions of its

high-purity titanium alloys and powders.

Customers

EMG is not dependent on any single customer such that the loss
    of that customer would have a material adverse effect on
    EMG’s operations. 14% of EMG’s 2008 sales were made to
    its five largest customers and no one customer accounted for 10%
    or more of 2008 consolidated net sales.



Marketing

The Company’s marketing efforts generally are organized and
    carried out at the division level. EIG makes significant use of
    distributors and sales representatives in marketing its
    products, as well as direct sales in some of its more
    technically sophisticated products. Within aerospace, its
    specialized customer base of aircraft and jet engine
    manufacturers is served primarily by direct sales engineers.
    Given the technical nature of many of its products, as well as
    its significant worldwide market share, EMG conducts much of its
    domestic and international marketing activities through a direct
    sales force and makes some use of sales representatives and
    distributors both in the United States and in other countries.

Competition

In general, most of the Company’s markets are highly
    competitive. The principal elements of competition for the
    Company’s products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality and service.

In the markets served by EIG, the Company believes that it ranks
    among the leading U.S. producers of certain measuring and
    control instruments. It also is a leader in the
    U.S. heavy-vehicle instrumentation and power instrument
    markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers
    to the commercial aviation market. Competition remains strong
    and can intensify for certain EIG products, especially its
    pressure gauge and heavy-vehicle instrumentation products. Both
    of these businesses have several strong competitors. In the
    process and analytical instruments market, numerous companies in
    each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality,
    performance and innovation. The aerospace and power instrument
    businesses have a number of diversified competitors, which vary
    depending on the specific market niche.

EMG’s differentiated businesses have competition from a
    limited number of companies in each of their markets.
    Competition is generally based on product innovation,
    performance and price. There also is competition from
    alternative materials and processes. In its cost-driven
    businesses, EMG has limited domestic competition in the
    U.S. floor care market from independent manufacturers.
    Competition is increasing from Asian motor manufacturers that
    serve both the U.S. and the European floor care markets.
    Increasingly, global vacuum motor production is being shifted to
    Asia where AMETEK has a smaller but growing market position.
    There is potential competition from vertically integrated
    manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own
    motor-blowers. Many of these manufacturers would also be
    potential EMG customers if they decided to outsource their motor
    production.

Backlog
    and Seasonal Variations of Business

The Company’s backlog of unfilled orders by business
    segment was as follows at December 31:

The higher backlog at December 31, 2008 was primarily due
    to the six businesses acquired in 2008, partially offset by the
    negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar when
    compared to the British pound and Euro.

Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31,
    2008, approximately 84% is expected to be shipped by
    December 31, 2009. The Company believes that neither its
    business as a whole, nor either of its reportable segments, is
    subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain
    individual operations experience some seasonal variability.

Availability
    of Raw Materials

The Company’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and
    supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than
    one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various
    base metals and certain steel



components, are available only from a limited number of
    suppliers. The Company believes its sources and supplies of raw
    materials are adequate for its needs.

Research,
    Product Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development and engineering costs
    before customer reimbursement were $115.9 million,
    $102.9 million and $87.6 million in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2008, 2007 and
    2006 were $6.1 million, $7.1 million and
    $6.4 million, respectively. These amounts included

net Company-funded

research and development expenses of $57.5 million,
    $52.9 million and $42.0 million, respectively. All
    such expenditures were directed toward the development of new
    products and processes and the improvement of existing products
    and processes.

Environmental
    Matters

Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth
    in the section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations entitled
    “Environmental Matters” and in Note 17 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Patents,
    Licenses and Trademarks

The Company owns numerous unexpired U.S. patents and
    foreign patents, including counterparts of its more important
    U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the
    world. The Company is a licensor or licensee under patent
    agreements of various types and its products are marketed under
    various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign
    trademarks and trade names. However, the Company does not
    consider any single patent or trademark, or any group thereof,
    essential either to its business as a whole or to either of its
    business segments. The annual royalties received or paid under
    license agreements are not significant to either of its
    reportable segments or to the Company’s overall operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2008, the Company employed approximately
    11,700 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of
    whom approximately 3,200 employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. The Company has one collective
    bargaining agreement that will expire in 2009, which covers less
    than 20 employees. The Company expects no material adverse
    effects from the pending labor contract negotiation.

Working
    Capital Practices

The Company does not have extraordinary working capital
    requirements in either of its reportable segments. Customers
    generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include
    extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled
    and maintained at levels related to production cycles and are
    responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all
    other information contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect
    our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Current
    economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could
    adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

The global economy is currently undergoing a period of
    unprecedented volatility and distress in financial markets, as
    well as a general slowdown in demand, including in many of the
    end markets we serve. A prolonged



period of economic decline could have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations and financial condition and
    exacerbate the other risk factors we have described below. These
    economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number
    of ways. Our global business is adversely affected by decreases
    in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in
    business and consumer spending, capital spending, air travel,
    industrial production and government procurement. Any economic
    slowdown results in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for
    our products and services and negatively impacts the ability of
    our customers to make timely payments. In addition, the
    potential for one or more of our customers or suppliers to
    experience financial distress or bankruptcy is increased.
    Furthermore, a disparate impact on, or government actions
    affecting, one of the major economies could produce volatility
    in the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against certain
    major currencies, adversely affecting our results. We are unable
    to predict the likely duration and severity of the current
    disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions
    in the U.S. and other countries.

A
    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely
    affect our business.

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in
    nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control.
    A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process
    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our
    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be
    able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate
    recent and future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of
    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2004, through
    December 31, 2008, we have completed 23 acquisitions. We
    plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our
    global market position and broaden our product offerings.
    Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies
    in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions
    will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:

•

Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;

•

The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may
    increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate
    acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a
    greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;

•

Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including
    integrating the financial, technological and management
    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses
    with those of our existing operations;

•

Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms
    acceptable to us;

•

U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting
    our ability to make certain acquisitions;

•

Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of
    acquired businesses;

•

Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

•

Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity
    and complexity of our operations.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing
    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and
    may require additional financial resources and attention from
    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing
    development or expansion of our existing operations.
    Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired
    business may not achieve the results we expected or produce
    expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue
    with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of
    acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.



We may
    experience unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    product line transfers.

Certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently
    relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.
    Unanticipated

start-up

expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or
    completing product line transfers, as well as possible
    underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in
    production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our
    business and operations.

Our
    substantial international sales and operations are subject to
    customary risks associated with international
    operations.

International sales for 2008 and 2007 represented 48% and 49% of
    our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our
    growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales
    outside the United States will increase in the future.
    International operations are subject to the customary risks of
    operating in an international environment, including:

•

Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;

•

Overlap of different tax structures;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including
    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries
    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;

•

Restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

General economic conditions;

•

Unstable political situations;

•

Nationalization of assets; and

•

Compliance with a wide variety of international and
    U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.

Our
    international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by
    compliance with export laws.

We are required to comply with various import, export, export
    control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our
    transactions with certain customers, business partners and other
    persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our
    employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export
    control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the
    export of certain products, services and technologies and in
    other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export
    license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure
    to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil
    and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions
    to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export
    products and services and damage to our reputation.

Any
    inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to
    compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of
    qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate
    acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results
    from those businesses, manage our expanding international
    operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if
    we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the
    expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and
    employees may adversely affect our results of operations.



If we
    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could
    adversely affect our business and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our
    ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced
    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.
    Although we believe we have certain technological and other
    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages
    will require us to continue investing in research and
    development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance
    that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments,
    that we will be able to make the technological advances
    necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can
    recover major research and development expenses. We are not
    currently aware of any emerging standards or new products, which
    could render our existing products obsolete, although there can
    be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able
    to develop and successfully market new products.

A
    shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could
    increase our operating costs.

We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material
    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;
    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel
    components, are available only from a limited number of
    suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations.
    Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could
    affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our
    competitive position, which could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Certain
    environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs
    associated with hazardous or toxic substance

clean-up

which may adversely affect our financial
    condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a
    number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
    occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning,
    among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the
    use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage,
    transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
    Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing
    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous
    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of
    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at
    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew
    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous
    materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint
    and several liability for

clean-up

costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing
    hazardous substances to sites designated for

clean-up

under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible
    party at several sites, which are the subject of
    government-mandated

clean-ups.

As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that
    use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous
    materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation,
    removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to
    compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to
    precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending
    environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we
    believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have
    a material adverse effect on our financial position or future
    results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations,
    new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement
    of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis
    for new or increased liabilities that could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. There can be no assurance that future
    environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental
    damages due to prior or present practices will not result in
    future liabilities.

We are
    subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be
    burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and
    foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing
    laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new
    laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us.
    We cannot predict the impact any of these laws and regulations
    will have on our business or operations.



We may
    be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with
    alleged or actual harm caused by our products.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product
    liability claims in the event that the use of our products is
    alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For
    example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for
    personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for
    instance, an aircraft component that has been designed,
    manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur significant
    liability if product liability lawsuits against us are
    successful. While we believe our current general liability and
    product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from
    future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate
    to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be
    able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an
    acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for
    which third-party indemnification is not available could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We
    operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely
    affect our results of operations or ability to expand our
    business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and
    internationally, with individual producers, as well as with
    vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have
    resources greater than we do. The principal elements of
    competition for our products are price, product technology,
    distribution, quality and service. EMG’s competition in
    specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and
    processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG
    is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify.
    In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets
    served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the
    basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our
    competitors may develop new or improve existing products that
    are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new
    technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There
    can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely
    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
    operates or that our products will be able to compete
    successfully with those of our competitors.

Our
    access to sources of liquidity may be limited by market
    conditions and restrictions in our revolving credit facility and
    other agreements.

In recent months, the financial markets have experienced a
    significant liquidity shortfall as a result of diverse
    conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a
    number of large financial services companies. If the
    availability of funds remains limited, we could incur increased
    costs associated with our receivables securitization facility,
    any renewal of our credit facility

and/or

other
    debt instruments. In addition, it is possible that our ability
    to access the credit market may be limited by these or other
    factors, at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which
    could have an impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt

and/or

react
    to changing economic and business conditions. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, at this time, we believe that available
    short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to
    fund our working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments,
    interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan
    contributions, income tax obligations, dividends to our
    shareholders, any contemplated acquisitions and share
    repurchases for the foreseeable future.

We are
    subject to possible insolvency of financial
    counterparties.

We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts
    including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit
    facilities, financial derivatives and investment management
    agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to
    the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become
    insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its obligations
    under such contracts.

Our
    goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial
    amount of our total assets and write-off of such substantial
    goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible
    assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2008, goodwill
    and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
    totaled $1,681.8 million or 55% of our total assets. The
    goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess
    of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other
    identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum,
    we assess annually whether there



has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If
    future operating performance at one or more of our business
    units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could
    reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash
    charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible
    asset impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a
    significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would
    negatively affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Properties

The Company has 99 operating plant facilities in 22 states
    and 12 foreign countries. Of these facilities, 53 are owned by
    the Company and 46 are leased. The properties owned by the
    Company consist of approximately 654 acres, of which
    approximately 4.7 million square feet are under roof. Under
    lease is a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet.
    The leases expire over a range of years from 2009 to 2082, with
    renewal options for varying terms contained in many of the
    leases. Production facilities in Taiwan, China and Japan provide
    the Company with additional production capacity through the
    Company’s investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures.
    The Company’s executive offices in Paoli, Pennsylvania,
    occupy approximately 34,000 square feet under a lease that
    expires in September 2010.

The Company’s machinery and equipment, plants and offices
    are in satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the
    uses to which they are put. The operating facilities of the
    Company by business segment are summarized in the following
    table:

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company

and/or

its
    subsidiaries have been named as defendants, along with many
    other companies, in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. To
    date, no judgments have been entered against the Company. The
    Company believes it has strong defenses to the claims and
    intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these
    matters. Other companies are also indemnifying the Company
    against certain of these claims. To date, these parties have met
    their obligations in all material respects; however, one of
    these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007.

In October 2008, the Company received a Notice of Administrative
    Civil Liability from the San Diego Regional Water Quality
    Control Board seeking certain penalties. The Notice claims that
    a former subsidiary of AMETEK, which became a separate company
    in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, failed to
    adequately produce a delineation report and feasibility study
    within specified time frames. We believe we have good and valid
    defenses to this claim and intend to vigorously defend against
    it. (Also see “Environmental Matters” in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations and Note 17 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company’s
    security holders, through the solicitation of proxies or
    otherwise, during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended
    December 31, 2008.



PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The principal market on which the Company’s common stock is
    traded is the New York Stock Exchange and it is traded under the
    symbol “AME.” On January 30, 2009, there were
    approximately 2,294 holders of record of the Company’s
    common stock.

Market price and dividend information with respect to the
    Company’s common stock is set forth below. Future dividend
    payments by the Company will be dependent on future earnings,
    financial requirements, contractual provisions of debt
    agreements and other relevant factors.

The Company repurchased, under its share repurchase program,
    approximately 1,263,000 shares of common stock for
    $57.4 million and approximately 144,000 shares of
    common stock for $5.4 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, to offset the dilutive effect of shares granted as
    equity-based compensation.

EBITDA represents income before
    interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is
    presented because the Company is aware that it is used by rating
    agencies, securities analysts, investors and other parties in
    evaluating the Company. It should not be considered, however, as
    an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the
    Company’s operating performance or as an alternative to
    cash flows as a measure of the Company’s overall liquidity
    as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Furthermore, EBITDA measures shown for the Company
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
    companies. The following table presents the reconciliation of

    Selected Financial Data” and the consolidated financial
    statements and related notes included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

Business
    Overview

As a global business, AMETEK’s operations are affected by
    global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the
    Company’s strategic geographic and industry
    diversification, and its mix of products and services, have
    helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable
    developments in any one industry or the economy of any single
    country on its consolidated operating results. For most of 2008,
    the Company continued to experience strong market conditions in
    many of its businesses. However, beginning in the fourth quarter
    of 2008, the Company experienced lower order rates as a result
    of the current financial and economic crisis. For the full year
    2008, contributions from recent acquisitions and internal
    growth, combined with successful Operational Excellence
    initiatives, enabled the Company to post another year of record
    sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per
    share. In addition to achieving its financial objectives, the
    Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under
    AMETEK’s four growth strategies: Operational Excellence,
    New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion and
    Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2008 were:

•

In 2008, sales were $2.5 billion, an increase of
    $394.2 million or 18% from 2007, on internal growth of
    approximately 5% in the Electronic Instruments Group
    (“EIG”) and 2% in the Electromechanical Group
    (“EMG”) excluding the effect of foreign currency
    translation, and contributions from the 2007 and 2008
    acquisitions. During 2008, the Company completed the following
    acquisitions:

•

In February 2008, the Company acquired Drake Air
    (“Drake”). Drake is a provider of heat-transfer repair
    services to the commercial aerospace industry.

•

In February 2008, the Company acquired Motion Control Group
    (“MCG”). MCG is a leading global manufacturer of
    highly customized motors and motion control solutions for the
    medical, life sciences, industrial automation, semiconductor and
    aviation markets.

•

In April 2008, the Company acquired Reading Alloys. Reading
    Alloys is a global leader in specialty titanium master alloys
    and highly engineered metal powders used in the aerospace,
    medical implant, military and electronics markets.

•

In June 2008, the Company acquired Vision Research, Inc. Vision
    Research is a leading manufacturer of high-speed digital imaging
    systems used for motion capture and analysis in numerous test
    and measurement applications.

•

In August 2008, the Company acquired the programmable power
    business of Xantrex Technology, Inc. (“Xantrex
    Programmable”). Xantrex Programmable is a leader in
    alternating current and direct current programmable power
    supplies used to test electrical and electronic products.

•

In November 2008, the Company acquired UK-based Muirhead
    Aerospace Limited (“Muirhead”). Muirhead is a leading
    manufacturer of motion technology products and a provider of
    avionics repair and overhaul services for the aerospace and
    defense markets.

•

As the Company grows globally, it continues to achieve an
    increasing level of international sales. International sales,
    including U.S. export sales, were $1,225.5 million of
    consolidated sales in 2008, compared with $1,053.7 million
    of consolidated sales in 2007.



•

The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research,
    development and engineering, spending $115.9 million in
    2008 before customer reimbursement of $6.1 million, an
    increase of 12.6% over 2007. Sales from products introduced in
    the last three years increased $71.5 million or 18.3% in
    2008 to $462.8 million.

•

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September
    2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due
    September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second
    funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million,
    consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due
    December 2018. The proceeds from the senior notes were used to
    pay down a portion of the Company’s revolving credit
    facility.

•

In July 2008, the Company repaid the $225 million
    7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using proceeds from
    borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax
    charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of
    reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted
    share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee
    reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well
    as asset write-downs ($7.4 million) as a result of the
    global economic recession and financial crisis.

•

In 2008, the Company made $79.9 million in contributions to
    its defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and the
    United Kingdom. $74.0 million in contributions were made in
    the fourth quarter of 2008, which had the effect of eliminating
    or significantly reducing the amount of unfunded pension
    obligations associated with the Company’s pension plans.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Results
    of Operations

In 2008, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
    income and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved
    these results from contributions from acquisitions completed in
    2008 and 2007, as well as internal growth in both EIG and EMG.
    Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a
    continued focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational
    Excellence initiatives. The Company expects the current
    financial and economic crisis, to have a negative impact on
    operating results in 2009. The full year impact of the 2008
    acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities will
    have a positive impact on our 2009 results.

Net sales for 2008 were $2,531.1 million, an increase of
    $394.2 million or 18.4% when compared with net sales of
    $2,136.9 million in 2007. Net sales for EIG were
    $1,402.7 million in 2008, an increase of 16.9% from sales
    of $1,199.8 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were
    $1,128.5 million in 2008, an increase of 20.4% from sales
    of $937.1 million in 2007. The Company’s internal
    sales growth was approximately 4% in 2008, which excludes a 1%
    favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by
    strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions
    mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales
    increase.

Total international sales for 2008 were $1,225.5 million or
    48.4% of consolidated net sales, an increase of
    $171.8 million or 16.3% when compared with international
    sales of $1,053.7 million or 49.3% of consolidated net
    sales in 2007. The increase in international sales resulted from
    increased international sales from base businesses of
    $29.3 million or 17.0% of the increase, which includes the
    effect of foreign currency translation, as well as the
    acquisitions completed in 2008 and 2007, most notably Cameca SAS
    (“Cameca”), the Repair & Overhaul Division
    of Umeco plc (“Umeco R&O”), Reading Alloys,
    California Instruments Corporation (“California
    Instruments”) and Vision Research. Increased international
    sales came primarily from sales to Europe and Asia by both
    reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States,
    which are included in total international sales, were
    $478.5 million in 2008, an increase of $84.1 million
    or 21.3% compared with $394.4 million in 2007. Export
    shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from the
    base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.

New orders for 2008 were a record at $2,561.5 million, an
    increase of $273.2 million or 11.9% when compared with
    $2,288.3 million in 2007. The increase in new orders was
    primarily due to the recent acquisitions noted above. As a
    result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at
    December 31, 2008 was $718.6 million, an increase of
    $30.4 million or 4.4% when compared with
    $688.2 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in
    backlog was primarily due to the acquired backlog of the recent
    acquisitions noted above. Beginning in the fourth quarter of
    2008 through the filing date of this

Form 10-K,

the Company has experienced lower order rates as a result of the
    current financial and economic crisis.

The year ended December 31, 2008 results include fourth
    quarter pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had
    the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25
    per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs
    for employee reductions and facility closures
    ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs
    ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges,
    $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million
    of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded
    in Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were
    reported in segment operating income as follows:
    $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and
    $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other
    expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and
    facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as
    part of cost reduction initiatives to be broadly implemented
    across the Company’s various businesses during fiscal 2009.
    The restructuring costs include the consolidation of
    manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low
    cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to
    lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the
    Company’s businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges
    of $30.1 million for severance costs for slightly more than
    10% of the Company’s workforce. The Company also recorded
    pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs
    associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009.
    Substantially all of the payments for employee severance and
    lease termination costs are expected to be made in 2009.

Segment operating income for 2008 was $481.9 million, an
    increase of $54.4 million or 12.7% when compared with
    segment operating income of $427.5 million in 2007. Segment
    operating income, as a percentage of sales,



decreased to 19.0% for 2008 from 20.0% in 2007. The increase in
    segment operating income resulted primarily from strength in the
    Company’s differentiated businesses and profit
    contributions made by the acquisitions, partially offset by the
    fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs described above. The decrease in segment operating
    margins resulted primarily from the restructuring charges and
    asset write-downs, which negatively impacted segment operating
    margins by 160 basis points.

SG&A expenses for 2008 were $322.6 million, an
    increase of $59.1 million or 22.4% when compared with
    $263.5 million in 2007. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
    expenses were 12.7% for 2008, compared with 12.3% in 2007. The
    increase in SG&A expenses was the result of higher sales,
    as well as a $7.1 million charge — representing a
    0.3% increase in SG&A expenses — recorded in
    corporate administrative expenses related to the accelerated
    vesting of an April 2005 restricted stock grant in the second
    quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million of SG&A expense
    related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and
    asset write-downs described above. Additionally, the
    Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire
    differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution
    channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher
    content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses
    increased approximately 7.9%. Excluding the impact of the fourth
    quarter restructuring charges and asset write-downs on selling
    expense of $6.9 million, a 3.2% impact, and foreign
    currency translation, the increase in 2008 base business selling
    expenses was in line with internal sales growth. Selling
    expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 10.8% for 2008,
    compared with 10.4% in 2007.

Corporate administrative expenses for 2008 were
    $49.2 million, an increase of $8.4 million or 20.6%
    when compared with $40.8 million in 2007. As a percentage
    of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.9%, in both
    2008 and 2007. The increase in corporate administrative expenses
    was primarily the result of equity-based compensation associated
    with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the second
    quarter of 2008, noted above, as well as other expenses
    necessary to grow the Company, partially offset by equity-based
    compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of
    restricted stock in the first and third quarters of 2007.

Consolidated operating income was $432.7 million or 17.1%
    of sales for 2008, an increase of $46.1 million or 11.9%
    when compared with $386.6 million or 18.1% of sales in 2007.

Interest expense was $63.7 million for 2008, an increase of
    $16.8 million or 35.8% when compared with
    $46.9 million in 2007. The increase was due to the impact
    of the funding of the private placement senior notes in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 and the third and fourth quarters of
    2008, higher average borrowings to fund the recent acquisitions
    and the repurchase of 1.3 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock in 2008.

The effective tax rate for 2008 was 32.6% compared with 32.2% in
    2007. The higher effective tax rate for 2008 primarily reflects
    an increase in state and foreign income taxes and the impact of
    accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock
    amortization, offset by the impact of settlements of various
    income tax issues with U.S. taxing authorities and a
    favorable agreement in the United Kingdom related to deductible
    interest expense for which previously unrecognized tax benefits
    were recognized. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 primarily
    reflects an enacted decrease in certain foreign corporate tax
    rates in the second half of 2007, partially offset by the
    elimination of the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial
    Income (“FSC/ETI”) tax benefit. See Note 11 of
    the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this

Form 10-K

for further details.

Net income for 2008 was $247.0 million, an increase of
    $19.0 million or 8.3% when compared with
    $228.0 million in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008
    was $2.30, an increase of $0.18 or 8.5% when compared with $2.12
    per diluted share in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008
    includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted
    earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.

Segment
    Results

EIG’s

sales totaled $1,402.7 million for 2008,
    an increase of $202.9 million or 16.9% when compared with
    $1,199.8 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 5%, excluding a favorable 1%
    effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by
    EIG’s aerospace, power, and process and analytical
    instrument businesses. The acquisitions of Advanced Industries,
    Inc. (“Advanced”), B&S Aircraft Parts and
    Accessories (“B&S”), Cameca, California
    Instruments, Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex Programmable
    accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.



EIG’s operating income was $306.8 million for 2008, an
    increase of $46.5 million or 17.9% when compared with
    $260.3 million in 2007. The increases in segment operating
    income were due to the contribution from the higher sales by
    EIG’s aerospace, power and process and analytical
    businesses, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above,
    partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
    charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million. EIG’s
    operating margins were 21.9% of sales for 2008 compared with
    21.7% of sales in 2007. The increase in operating margins was
    driven by operational excellence initiatives throughout the
    group. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and
    asset write-downs had a negative impact on EIG’s operating
    margins of 140 basis points.

EMG’s

sales totaled $1,128.5 million for 2008,
    an increase of $191.4 million or 20.4% from
    $937.1 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 2%, excluding a favorable 1%
    effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by
    EMG’s differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of Seacon
    Phoenix, subsequently renamed AMETEK SCP, Inc.
    (“SCP”), Hamilton Precision Metals
    (“Hamilton”), Umeco R&O, Drake Air, MCG,
    Reading Alloys and Muirhead accounted for the remainder of the
    sales increase.

EMG’s operating income was $175.2 million for 2008, an
    increase of $8.0 million or 4.8% when compared with
    $167.2 million in 2007. EMG’s increase in operating
    income was primarily due to higher sales from the group’s
    differentiated businesses, which include the acquisitions
    mentioned above, partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs of
    $19.4 million. EMG’s operating margins were 15.5% of
    sales for 2008 compared with 17.8% of sales in 2007. The
    decrease in operating margins was primarily driven by the fourth
    quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs,
    which had a negative impact on operating margins of
    170 basis points. The remainder of the decrease was the
    dilutive impact of recent acquisitions.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were
    $623.7 million, an increase of $40.4 million or 6.9%
    when compared with net sales of $583.3 million for the
    fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales for EIG were
    $361.6 million in 2008, an increase of 7.6% from sales of
    $336.1 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were
    $262.1 million in 2008, an increase of 6.1% from sales of
    $247.1 million in 2007. The Company’s internal sales
    growth was approximately negative 2%, which excludes a 4%
    unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The
    acquisitions mentioned above made up the net sales increase.

The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include
    pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the
    effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per
    diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million),
    as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the
    $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in
    cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges
    and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in
    segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG,
    $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate
    administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for
    employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans
    established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives
    to be broadly implemented across the Company’s various
    businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include
    the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of
    production to low cost locales and a general reduction in
    workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes
    in certain of the Company’s businesses. The Company
    recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance
    costs for slightly more than 10% of the Company’s
    workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of
    $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with
    the closure of certain facilities in 2009. Substantially all of
    the payments for employee severance and lease termination costs
    are expected to be made in 2009.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was
    $43.8 million, a decrease of $18.1 million or 29.2%
    when compared with $61.9 million for the fourth quarter of
    2007. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2008
    was $0.41, a decrease of $0.16 or 28.1% when compared with $0.57
    per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted
    earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of
    2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which
    negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.



Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Results
    of Operations

In 2007, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net
    income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow from
    operations. The Company achieved these results from strong
    internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions
    from acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Operating income increased,
    driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost
    reduction programs under our Operational Excellence initiatives.

Net sales for 2007 were $2,136.9 million, an increase of
    $317.6 million or 17.5% when compared with net sales of
    $1,819.3 million in 2006. Net sales for EIG were
    $1,199.8 million in 2007, an increase of 18.0% from sales
    of $1,016.5 million in 2006. Net sales for EMG were
    $937.1 million in 2007, an increase of 16.7% from sales of
    $802.8 million in 2006. The Company’s internal sales
    growth was approximately 7% in 2007, which excludes a 2%
    favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by
    strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions
    mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales
    increase.

Total international sales for 2007 were $1,053.7 million or
    49.3% of consolidated net sales, an increase of
    $187.7 million or 21.7% when compared with international
    sales of $866.0 million or 47.6% of consolidated net sales
    in 2006. The increase in international sales primarily resulted
    from increased international sales from base businesses of
    $74.9 million or 39.9% of the increase, which includes the
    effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions of
    Cameca, SCP, Hamilton and Umeco R&O in 2007 and Land
    Instruments International Limited (“Land
    Instruments”), PennEngineering Motion Technologies, Inc.
    (“Pittman”), Precitech and Southern Aeroparts, Inc.
    (“SAI”) in 2006 contributed the remainder of the
    increase. Increased international sales came primarily from
    sales to Europe by both reportable segments. Export shipments
    from the United States, which are included in total
    international sales, were $394.4 million in 2007, an
    increase of $50.6 million or 14.7% compared with
    $343.8 million in 2006. Export shipments improved primarily
    due to increased exports from the base businesses and
    acquisitions noted above.

New orders for 2007 were $2,288.3 million, an increase of
    $372.9 million or 19.5% when compared with
    $1,915.4 million in 2006. The increase in new orders was
    driven by the Company’s base differentiated businesses,
    which contributed $167.2 million or 44.8% of the increase,
    led by the Company’s aerospace and engineered materials,
    interconnects and packaging businesses. The acquisitions
    mentioned above contributed the remainder of the increase. As a
    result, the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at
    December 31, 2007 was $688.2 million, an increase of
    $151.4 million or 28.2% when compared with
    $536.8 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in
    backlog was due to higher order levels in base differentiated
    businesses and the 2007 acquisitions noted above.

Segment operating income for 2007 was $427.5 million, an
    increase of $84.1 million or 24.5% when compared with
    segment operating income of $343.4 million in 2006. Segment
    operating income, as a percentage of sales, increased to 20.0%
    for 2007 from 18.9% in 2006. The increase in segment operating
    income resulted from strength in the differentiated businesses
    of each group, which includes the profit contributions made by
    the acquisitions. The margin improvement came from the
    Company’s differentiated businesses.

SG&A expenses for 2007 were $263.5 million, an
    increase of $44.0 million or 20.1% when compared with
    $219.5 million in 2006. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
    expenses were higher in 2007 at 12.3% compared to 12.1% in 2006.
    Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 10.4% in 2007,
    slightly higher than the 10.2% in 2006. The selling expense
    increase and the corresponding increase in selling expenses as a
    percentage of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions.
    The Company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire
    differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution
    channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher
    content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses
    increased 9.7% for 2007, compared to 2006, which was in line
    with internal sales growth including the impact of foreign
    currency translation.

Corporate administrative expenses for 2007 were
    $40.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 19.4%
    when compared with $34.2 million in 2006. The increase in
    corporate expenses was the result of higher compensation,
    including equity-based compensation associated with accelerated
    vesting of restricted stock grants in 2007 and other costs
    necessary to grow the Company. As a percentage of sales,
    corporate administrative expenses were 1.9% in both 2007 and
    2006.



Consolidated operating income was $386.6 million or 18.1%
    of sales for 2007, an increase of $77.6 million or 25.1%
    when compared with $309.0 million or 17.0% of sales in 2006.

Interest expense was $46.9 million for 2007, an increase of
    $4.7 million or 11.1% when compared with $42.2 million
    in 2006. The increase was due to higher average borrowings to
    fund the 2007 acquisitions, higher average interest rates and
    the impact of the fourth quarter of 2007 funding of the private
    placement senior notes.

The effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.2% compared with 31.0% in
    2006. The 2007 effective tax rate primarily reflects the
    elimination of the FSC/ETI tax benefit in 2007, an increase in
    state income taxes and an increase in interest and penalties on
    uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an enacted decrease
    in certain foreign corporate tax rates in the second half of
    2007 and the recognition of tax benefits from our international
    tax planning initiatives. The 2006 effective tax rate benefited
    primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign
    tax credit carryforwards of $3.2 million, offset somewhat
    by higher nondeductible equity-based compensation.

Net income for 2007 was $228.0 million, an increase of
    $46.1 million or 25.3% when compared with
    $181.9 million in 2006. Diluted earnings per share for 2007
    was $2.12, an increase of $0.41 or 24.0% when compared with
    $1.71 per diluted share in 2006.

Segment
    Results

EIG’s

sales totaled $1,199.8 million for 2007,
    an increase of $183.3 million or 18.0% when compared with
    $1,016.5 million in 2006. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 9%, excluding a favorable 2%
    effect of foreign currency translation. The internal growth was
    driven by sales increases in EIG’s process and analytical,
    aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of Cameca, Land
    Instruments, Precitech, Advanced and B&S accounted for the
    remainder of the sales increase.

EIG’s operating income was $260.3 million for 2007, an
    increase of $56.9 million or 28.0% when compared with
    $203.4 million in 2006. EIG’s operating margins were
    21.7% of sales for 2007 compared with 20.0% of sales in 2006.
    The increase in operating income and margins came from the
    group’s base differentiated businesses, which include the
    acquisitions mentioned above.

EMG’s

sales totaled $937.1 million for 2007, an
    increase of $134.3 million or 16.7% from
    $802.8 million in 2006. The sales increase was due to
    internal growth of approximately 6%, excluding a favorable 2%
    effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by
    EMG’s differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of
    Pittman, SAI, SCP, Umeco R&O and Hamilton accounted for the
    remainder of the sales increase.

EMG’s operating income was $167.2 million for 2007, an
    increase of $27.3 million or 19.5% when compared with
    $139.9 million in 2006. EMG’s increase in operating
    income was due to strength in the group’s differentiated
    businesses, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above.
    EMG’s operating margins were 17.8% of sales for 2007
    compared with 17.4% of sales in 2006. The increase in operating
    margins was primarily due to an increased contribution from the
    group’s differentiated businesses.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $247.3 million in 2008, a decrease of $31.2 million or
    11.2% when compared with $278.5 million in 2007. The
    decrease in operating cash flow was primarily the result of
    higher defined benefit pension plan contributions of
    $79.9 million in 2008, a $74.7 million increase over
    the $5.2 million contributed in 2007. The 2008
    contributions had the effect of eliminating or significantly
    reducing the amount of unfunded pension obligations associated
    with the Company’s pension plans. Also impacting operating
    cash flow are higher overall operating working capital levels
    necessary to grow the Company, partially offset by higher
    earnings. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital
    spending) was $203.1 million in 2008, compared to
    $240.9 million in 2007. EBITDA (earnings before interest,
    income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was
    $489.4 million in 2008, which includes the fourth quarter
    of 2008 pre-tax restructuring charges and asset write-downs of
    $40.0 million, compared with $433.9 million in 2007, a
    12.8% improvement. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented
    because the Company is aware that they are measures used by
    third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the “Notes to
    Selected Financial Data” included in Item 6 for a
    reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (“GAAP”) measures to comparable non-GAAP
    measures).



Cash used for investing activities totaled $496.6 million
    in 2008, compared with $334.7 million in 2007. In 2008, the
    Company paid $463.0 million for six business acquisitions
    and one technology line acquisition, net of cash received,
    compared with $300.6 million paid for seven business
    acquisitions and one technology line, net of cash received in
    2007. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled
    $44.2 million in 2008, compared with $37.6 million in
    2007.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled
    $173.5 million in 2008, compared with $174.1 million
    in 2007. In 2008, net total borrowings increased by
    $266.9 million, compared with a net total increase of
    $180.9 million in 2007. Short-term borrowings increased
    $69.7 million in 2008, compared with a decrease of
    $162.6 million in 2007. Long-term borrowings increased
    $197.2 million in 2008, compared to an increase of
    $343.4 million in 2007.

In July 2008, the Company repaid the $225 million
    7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from
    borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September
    2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due
    September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second
    funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million,
    consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due
    December 2018. The senior notes carry a weighted average
    interest rate of 6.93%. The senior notes are subject to certain
    customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among
    other things, require the Company to maintain certain
    debt-to-EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from
    the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the
    borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit
    facility.

In May 2008, the accounts receivable securitization facility was
    amended and restated, extending the expiration date from May
    2008 to May 2009, and bringing the borrowing capacity to
    $100 million from $110 million previously. There were
    no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2008.

In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $450 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in December
    2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due
    December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second
    funding occurred in July 2008 for $80 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018. The
    notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 6.25%. The
    proceeds from the first funding of the notes were used to pay
    down borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving
    credit facility, which included a foreign portion related to the
    2007 acquisition of Cameca and the 2006 acquisition of Land
    Instruments, as well as borrowings outstanding under the
    Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.
    Additionally, the proceeds from the private placement were used
    to purchase California Instruments in December 2007. The
    proceeds from the second funding of the notes were used to pay
    down a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the
    Company’s revolving credit facility.

In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility,
    increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million
    to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that
    permits the Company to request up to an additional
    $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time
    during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain
    conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility
    from October 2011 to June 2012. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had $468.9 million available under its revolving
    credit facility, including the $100 million accordion
    feature.

At December 31, 2008, total debt outstanding was
    $1,111.7 million, compared with $903.0 million at
    December 31, 2007. The debt-to-capital ratio was 46.3% at
    December 31, 2008, compared with 42.1% at December 31,
    2007. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and
    cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and
    stockholders’ equity) was 44.3% at December 31, 2008,
    compared with 37.1% at December 31, 2007. The net
    debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware
    that this measure is used by third



parties in evaluating the Company. (See the “Notes to
    Selected Financial Data” included in Item 6 for a
    reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP
    measures).

Additional financing activities for 2008 include the receipt of
    net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of
    $7.5 million compared with $17.2 million in 2007. Cash
    dividends paid were $25.7 million in both 2008 and 2007. In
    2008, the Company repaid $21.4 million in life insurance
    policy loans.

Repurchases of 1.3 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock in 2008 totaled $57.4 million, compared with a
    total of $5.4 million paid for approximately
    144,000 shares repurchased in 2007. On January 24,
    2008, the Board of Directors approved an increase of
    $50 million in the authorization for the repurchase of the
    Company’s common stock, adding to the $25.9 million
    that remained available at December 31, 2007 from an
    existing $50 million authorization approved in March 2003
    for a total of $75.9 million. On July 23, 2008, the
    Board of Directors approved another increase of $50 million
    in the authorization for the repurchase of the Company’s
    common stock, adding to the $18.5 million that remained
    available at June 30, 2008 from the existing
    $50 million authorization approved in January 2008 for a
    total of $68.5 million. At December 31, 2008,
    $68.5 million was available under the current Board
    authorization for future share repurchases.

The following table summarizes AMETEK’s contractual cash
    obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have

    Commitments

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of
    $16.4 million related to performance and payment guarantees
    at December 31, 2008. Based on experience with these
    arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may
    arise will not be material to its financial position.

The Company may, from time to time, repurchase its long-term
    debt in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon
    availability, market conditions and other factors.



As a result of all of the Company’s cash flow activities in
    2008, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008
    totaled $87.0 million, compared with $170.1 million at
    December 31, 2007. The Company’s liquidity has not
    been impacted by the recent financial crisis nor do we expect
    liquidity to be impacted in the near future. Additionally, the
    Company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants, which
    includes its financial covenants, for all of its debt
    agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient
    cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted
    foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to
    long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs
    and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as
    those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on
    the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations and that require the use of complex and
    subjective estimates based upon past experience and
    management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent
    in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the
    estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and
    related notes contain information that is pertinent to the
    Company’s accounting policies and to management’s
    discussion and analysis. The information that follows represents
    additional specific disclosures about the Company’s
    accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective
    decisions or assessments whereby materially different results of
    operations and financial condition could have been reported had
    different assumptions been used or different conditions existed.
    Primary disclosure of the Company’s significant accounting
    policies is in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements.

•

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is
    complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the
    customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under
    which title and risk of loss have been transferred,
    collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or
    determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and
    risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes
    revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other
    criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with
    respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that
    the customer may not return products or be given allowances,
    except at the Company’s option. The Company has agreements
    with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return
    for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from
    the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to
    the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
    incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume
    discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a
    reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for
    sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are
    provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past
    experience. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    accrual for future warranty obligations was $16.1 million,
    $14.4 million and $10.9 million, respectively. The
    Company’s expense for warranty obligations was
    $12.2 million, $11.3 million and $7.6 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The warranty periods for
    products sold vary widely among the Company’s operations,
    but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company
    calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty
    experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect
    actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and
    allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience,
    additional accruals may be required.

•

Accounts Receivable.

The Company maintains
    allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
    specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the
    Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against
    the amount due from these customers. For all other customers,
    the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the
    length of time specific receivables are past due based on its
    historical experience. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their
    inability to make payments, additional allowances may be
    required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $8.5 million and $6.4 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

•

Inventories.

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which
    approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 62% of
    its inventories at December 31, 2008. The

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to
    determine cost for the remaining 38% of its inventory at
    December 31, 2008. For inventories where cost is determined
    by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been
    $30.8 million and $35.6 million higher than the LIFO
    value reported in the consolidated balance



sheet at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving
    and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future
    demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing
    financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If
    these factors are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets.

The
    Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”). Under SFAS 142, purchased
    goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives,
    primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather,
    they are tested for impairment at least annually. These
    impairment tests include the projection and discounting of cash
    flows, estimates of future operating performance of the
    reporting unit being valued and estimates of the fair value of
    the intangible assets being tested. SFAS 142 requires a
    two-step impairment test for goodwill. The first step is to
    compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net
    assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair
    value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is
    required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying
    amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be
    completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the
    reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess
    being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount
    of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The
    Company would be required to record such impairment losses.
    Indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill are tested by
    estimating the fair values of those assets as of the
    Company’s measurement date, with such fair values based on
    expected future operating performance and discount rates
    determined by management. Changes in interest rates and market
    conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these
    estimates. These estimates will likely change over time. The
    Company’s acquisitions have generally included a large
    goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make
    acquisitions. At December 31, 2008, goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled
    $1,681.8 million, or 55.0% of the Company’s total
    assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment
    test in the fourth quarter of 2008 and determined that the
    Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were
    not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or
    indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the
    future.

•

Pensions.

The Company has U.S. and
    foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
    The Company accounts for all of its defined benefit pension
    plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

(“SFAS 87”) and SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Statements No. 87, 88,
    106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS 158”) for balance
    sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of
    pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the income
    statement recognition of the costs related to these plans.
    SFAS 87 and SFAS 158 require that amounts recognized
    in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis.
    The most significant elements in determining the Company’s
    pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability
    discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The
    pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at
    which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation
    date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the
    assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities.
    In estimating this rate for 2008, the Company considered rates
    of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments. The
    discount rate used in determining the 2008 pension cost was
    6.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 5.89% for
    foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded
    status of the plans at December 31, 2008 and determining
    the 2009 defined benefit pension cost is 6.50% for
    U.S. plans and 6.09% for foreign plans. In estimating the
    U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Company’s
    actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to
    the plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on yields
    derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent
    maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets for 2008 of 8.25% for U.S. defined
    benefit pension plans and 7.0% for foreign plans. The Company
    will continue to use these rates for 2009 for the U.S. and
    foreign plans, respectively. The Company determines the expected
    long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of
    future returns for the pension plans’ investments.
    Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on
    comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments and
    adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of
    compensation increase used in



determining the 2008 pension expense for the U.S. plans was
    3.75% and will remain unchanged in 2009. For foreign plans, the
    rate of compensation increase will be decreased from 3.86% in
    2008 to 2.98% in 2009. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income
    of $6.8 million from its U.S. and foreign defined
    benefit pension plans as compared with pre-tax pension income of
    $3.8 million recognized for these plans in 2007. The
    Company estimates its 2009 U.S. and foreign defined benefit
    pension plans pre-tax expense to be $15.4 million.

The Company follows the balance sheet recognition requirements
    of SFAS 158. Under SFAS 158, all unrecognized prior
    service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and
    actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax
    effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income
    (“AOCI”) in stockholders’ equity and will be
    amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. In
    addition, effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, the measurement date (the date at which
    plan assets and benefit obligation are measured) is required to
    be the Company’s fiscal year end. The Company uses a
    December 31 measurement date for its U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit plans as required by SFAS 158.

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its
    defined benefit pension plans during 2008 which totaled
    $79.9 million, compared with $5.2 million in 2007. The
    Company anticipates making approximately $19 million to
    $24 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit
    pension plans in 2009.

•

Income Taxes.

The process of providing for
    income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts
    requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments
    regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a
    broad range of operations around the world and is therefore
    subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international
    taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes
    and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain.
    Management must make judgments currently about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax
    assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs,
    future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and
    liabilities may be necessary.

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax
    assets, taking into consideration the Company’s forecast of
    future taxable income, available net operating loss
    carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could
    be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this
    assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the
    amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s
    deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances
    change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances
    may be required.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

. In accordance with FIN 48, the Company is
    required to assess the uncertainty in its tax positions, by
    applying a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
    required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the
    financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a
    more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates
    is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax
    benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the
    highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be
    realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax
    examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based
    on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax
    audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or
    by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There
    can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be
    realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and
    audit practice.

As a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), the Company recorded a
    $4.7 million increase in liabilities associated with
    unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties of
    $2.4 million, a decrease of $1.2 million in goodwill
    related to a previous business combination and a
    $5.9 million charge to the January 1, 2007 opening
    balance of retained earnings. The Company recognizes interest
    and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in
    income tax expense.



Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). In February 2008, the FASB
    issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    provides a one year deferral of the effective date of
    SFAS 157 for fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets
    and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items recognized or
    disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis (at least
    annually). The deferral applies to fair value in goodwill
    impairment testing, indefinite-lived intangible assets measured
    at fair value for impairment testing, asset retirement
    obligations initially measured at fair value, and nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair
    value in a business combination. Therefore, the Company has
    adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to its
    financial assets and liabilities only. SFAS 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
    under U.S. GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value
    measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS 157 as the
    exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

SFAS 157 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure
    of the inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value. This
    hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
    follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2
    inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
    liability, either directly or indirectly through market
    corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on
    the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and
    liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s
    classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
    lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

At December 31, 2008, $0.3 million of the
    Company’s cash and cash equivalents and $4.2 million
    of marketable securities are valued as level 1 investments.
    The Company held $8.5 million valued as level 2
    investments in the investments and other assets line of the
    consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not
    material.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”). This
    statement significantly changes the financial accounting and
    reporting of business combination transactions in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008 and prohibits early adoption. Upon adoption, SFAS 141R
    will not have a significant impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows. However, depending on the nature of an acquisition or the
    quantity of acquisitions entered into after the adoption,
    SFAS 141R may significantly impact the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows when compared to acquisitions accounted for under existing
    U.S. GAAP and result in more earnings volatility and
    generally lower earnings due to, among other items, the
    expensing of deal costs and restructuring costs of acquired
    companies.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 08-7,

Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets

(EITF 08-7).

EITF 08-7

clarifies how to account for acquired defensive intangible
    assets subsequent to initial measurement under SFAS 141R
    that the Company does not intend to actively use but does intend
    to hold to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset.

EITF 08-7

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, along with SFAS 141R. The Company has evaluated

EITF 08-7

and does not expect the adoption of

EITF 08-7

to have a material impact on its consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 significantly
    changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling
    (minority) interests in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early
    adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption of
    SFAS 160 to have an impact on its consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.



In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP

FAS 142-3”).

FSP

FAS 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142. FSP

FAS 142-3

is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life
    of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the
    period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of
    the asset under SFAS 141R, and other U.S. GAAP. FSP

FAS 142-3

applies to all intangible assets and is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. The Company has evaluated FSP

FAS 142-3

and does not expect the adoption of FSP

FAS 142-3

to have a material impact on its consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

Internal
    Reinvestment

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $44.2 million or 1.7% of sales in
    2008, compared with $37.6 million or 1.8% of sales in 2007.
    54% of the expenditures in 2008 were for improvements to
    existing equipment or additional equipment to increase
    productivity and expand capacity. The Company’s 2008
    capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on
    spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing
    capabilities. The 2009 capital expenditures are expected to
    approximate 2.0% of sales, with a continued emphasis on spending
    to improve productivity.

Product
    Development and Engineering

The Company is committed to research, product development and
    engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop
    potential new and improved products or enhance existing
    products. Research, product development and engineering costs
    before customer reimbursement were $115.9 million,
    $102.9 million and $87.6 million in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2008, 2007 and
    2006 were $6.1 million, $7.1 million and
    $6.4 million, respectively. These amounts included net
    Company-funded research and development expenses of
    $57.5 million, $52.9 million and $42.0 million,
    respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the
    development of new products and processes and the improvement of
    existing products and processes.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
    existing at that time, at December 31, 2008, the Company is
    named a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) at 16

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a
    “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the
    low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the
    amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 10 of these sites,
    the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the
    de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting
    executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement
    amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company
    is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
    attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
    responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an
    appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where
    the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is
    participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
    issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
    this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites,
    the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
    probable remediation activities at certain of its current or
    previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned”
    sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with
    respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established
    once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
    estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through
    the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
    feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
    instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for
    such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
    the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of
    remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current
    estimates and the



amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements;
    however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to
    result in a material change to the consolidated financial
    statements. In estimating the Company’s liability for
    remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate
    share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of
    the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2008 and 2007
    were $28.4 million and $25.3 million, respectively,
    for non-owned and owned sites. In 2008, the Company provided
    $7.3 million of additional reserves, including
    $5.6 million for existing sites and $1.7 million
    related to recent acquisitions. Additionally, the Company spent
    $4.2 million on environmental matters in 2008. The
    Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 include reserves of
    $17.9 million and $18.0 million, respectively, for an
    owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005
    acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is
    solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one
    of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in
    the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has
    obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from
    the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required
    remedial activities. At December 31, 2008, the Company has
    $12.4 million in receivables related to HCC for probable
    recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
    third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the
    Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for up to
    $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain
    of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously
    owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or
    new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
    Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
    under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other
    parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental
    matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in
    all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for
    bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, as discussed further in the
    following paragraph.

In October 2008, the Company received a Notice of Administrative
    Civil Liability from the San Diego Regional Water Quality
    Control Board seeking certain penalties. The Notice claims that
    a former subsidiary of AMETEK, which became a separate company
    in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, failed to
    adequately produce a delineation report and feasibility study
    within specified time frames. We believe we have good and valid
    defenses to this claim and intend to vigorously defend
    against it.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are
    sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing
    claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe
    that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations
    in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon
    presently available information and past experience related to
    such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been
    made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not
    expected to materially affect the consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Market
    Risk

The Company’s primary exposures to market risk are
    fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
    and commodity prices, which could impact its results of
    operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its
    exposure to these risks through its normal operating and
    financing activities. The Company’s differentiated and
    global business activities help to reduce the impact that any
    particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a
    whole.

The Company’s short-term debt carries variable interest
    rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates.
    These financial instruments are more fully described in the
    notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most
    significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British
    pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and the Mexican
    peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is
    monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional
    use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in
    the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign
    subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is
    included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant
    effect on the operating results reported by the Company because
    revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally
    transacted in the same foreign currencies.



The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure
    are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel,
    titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these
    commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in
    selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order
    pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes
    used to manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest
    rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the
    Company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in
    future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial
    instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual
    effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain matters discussed in this

Form 10-K

are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
    (“PSLRA”), which involve risk and uncertainties that
    exist in the Company’s operations and business environment
    and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or
    unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be
    important in determining the Company’s actual future
    results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe
    harbor” provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that
    numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in
    the future could cause, the Company’s actual results to
    differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
    statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not
    all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ from present expectations are set forth above
    and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no
    obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or
    otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

Management’s
    Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
    the consolidated financial statements and related information.
    The statements are prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently
    applied and include certain amounts based on management’s
    best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
    elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
    financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
    financial information, management maintains a system of internal
    accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
    program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
    division of responsibility and the application of written
    policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
    reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
    preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
    of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and
    presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however,
    there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
    system of internal controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
    Company’s activities according to the highest standards of
    personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
    characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
    all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
    Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
    other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
    Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
    firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
    that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
    report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
    of the Company for its 2009 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
    registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
    direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an
    opinion as to whether management’s financial statements
    present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s
    financial position and operating results. This report is
    included on page 41.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in the Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on the
    framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that
    evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2008.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, which appears on page 40.

February 25, 2009



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We have audited AMETEK, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 25,
    2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
    stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis of
    Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
    operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
    (the “Company”), and include the accounts of the
    Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany
    transactions in the consolidation. The Company’s
    investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted
    for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not
    significant to the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Cash
    Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
    less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, all of the Company’s
    equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those
    of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as
    “available-for-sale,” although the Company may hold
    fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income
    securities generally mature within three years. The aggregate
    market value of equity and fixed-income securities at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $11.9 million
    ($12.9 million amortized cost) and $17.9 million
    ($16.3 million amortized cost), respectively. The temporary
    unrealized gain or loss on such securities is recorded as a
    separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (in
    stockholders’ equity), and is not material. The Company had
    $0.2 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses in
    2008 and no other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2007.
    Certain of the Company’s other investments, which are not
    significant, are also accounted for by the equity method of
    accounting as discussed above.

Accounts
    Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
    from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
    obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
    receivables is recorded against the amount due from these
    customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
    reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
    specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The
    allowance for possible losses on receivables was
    $8.5 million and $6.4 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 6.

Inventories

The Company uses the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which
    approximates current replacement cost, for 62% of its
    inventories at December 31, 2008. The

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting is used to
    determine cost for the remaining 38% of the Company’s
    inventory at December 31, 2008. For inventories where cost
    is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value
    over the LIFO value was $30.8 million and
    $35.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves
    for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current
    assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers
    who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related
    management initiatives.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
    for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
    lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies,
    and maintenance and repairs is charged to



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operations as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is
    calculated principally on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of lives
    for depreciable assets is generally three to 10 years for
    machinery and equipment, five to 27 years for leasehold
    improvements and 25 to 50 years for buildings.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
    when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when
    products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of
    an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have
    been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of
    sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery,
    the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer,
    assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The
    policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances, generally
    provides that the customer may not return products or be given
    allowances, except at the Company’s option. The Company has
    agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights
    of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the
    product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss
    transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer
    substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors
    other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for these
    sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is
    recognized in the income statement. Accruals for sales returns,
    other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at
    the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the accrual for future
    warranty obligations was $16.1 million, $14.4 million
    and $10.9 million, respectively. The Company’s expense
    for warranty obligations was $12.2 million in 2008,
    $11.3 million in 2007 and $7.6 million in 2006. The
    warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the
    Company’s operations, but for the most part do not exceed
    one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision
    based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made
    periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.

Research
    and Development

Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
    operations as incurred and were $57.5 million in 2008,
    $52.9 million in 2007 and $42.0 million in 2006.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and
    were $34.0 million in 2008, $27.5 million in 2007 and
    $23.5 million in 2006.

Earnings
    Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
    weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding
    during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per
    share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities
    (principally outstanding common stock options and restricted
    stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the
    calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per
    share were as follows for the years ended December 31:

AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Financial
    Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
    using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and
    their results of operations are translated using average
    exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company
    and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their
    functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those
    transactions are included in operating results for the year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
    instruments. Forward contracts are entered into from time to
    time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain inventory
    purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the Company’s
    exposure to raw material commodity price or foreign currency
    fluctuation. No forward contracts were outstanding at
    December 31, 2008. During 2008, the Company was party to
    certain commodity price forward contracts pertaining to raw
    materials, which were not significant. These forward contracts
    were acquired as a part of a 2008 acquisition. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company was party to certain foreign
    currency forward contracts, which were not significant. These
    forward contracts were acquired as a part of a 2007 acquisition.
    In instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an
    underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (“AOCI”) within stockholders’ equity to the
    extent they are effective as hedges. The Company has designated
    certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of
    the net investment in certain foreign operations. These net
    investment hedges are the Company’s
    British-pound-denominated long-term debt and Euro-denominated
    long-term debt, pertaining to certain European acquisitions
    whose functional currencies are either the British pound or the
    Euro. These acquisitions were financed by
    foreign-currency-denominated borrowings under the Company’s
    revolving credit facility and all but 40 million British
    pounds ($58.4 million) at December 31, 2008 was
    subsequently refinanced with long-term private placement debt.
    These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges
    in each of the foreign subsidiaries on their respective dates of
    acquisition. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”), permits hedging the foreign
    currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. In
    accordance with SFAS 133, on the respective dates of
    acquisition, the Company designated the British pound- and
    Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments
    to offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the net investment
    in the acquired business due to changes in the British pound and
    Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced
    by management’s documentation supporting the
    contemporaneous hedge designation on the acquisition dates. As
    required by SFAS 133, any gain or loss on the hedging
    instrument following hedge designation (the debt), is reported
    in AOCI in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the
    investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to
    measure hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, all net investment hedges were effective. At
    December 31, 2008, the translation losses on the net
    carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments
    exceeded the translation gains on the carrying value of the
    underlying debt and the difference is included in AOCI. At
    December 31, 2007, the translation gains on the net
    carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments
    exceeded the translation losses on the carrying value of the
    underlying debt and the difference is included in AOCI. An
    evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company on
    an ongoing basis and any changes in the hedge are made as
    appropriate.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
    $189.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively, of
    British pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge
    against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in
    2008, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had $69.8 million and $73.0 million,
    respectively, of Euro-denominated loans, which were designated
    as a hedge against the net investment in a foreign subsidiary
    acquired in 2005. As a result of these British pound- and
    Euro-denominated loans being designated and effective as net
    investment hedges, $55.6 million of currency gains and
    $9.6 million of currency losses have been included in the
    foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive
    income at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”). Accordingly, the Company
    expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based
    plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial
    statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See
    Note 9.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and other intangible
    assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”).
    Under SFAS 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets
    with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are
    not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least
    annually.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents are being
    amortized over useful lives of four to 20 years. Customer
    relationships are being amortized over a period of two to
    20 years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being
    amortized over a period of 13 to 20 years. The Company
    periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated
    useful lives of these intangible assets.

In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives for impairment under SFAS 142, a determination of the
    fair value of the Company’s reporting units and its other
    intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based
    upon, among other things, estimates of future operating
    performance. Changes in market conditions, among other factors,
    may have an impact on these estimates. The Company completed its
    required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2008,
    2007 and 2006 and determined that the carrying values of
    goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were
    not impaired.

Income
    Taxes

The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), on January 1, 2007. As a result
    of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company recorded a
    $4.7 million increase in liabilities associated with
    unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties of
    $2.4 million, a decrease of $1.2 million in goodwill
    related to a previous business combination and a
    $5.9 million charge to the January 1, 2007, opening
    balance of retained earnings. The Company recognizes interest
    and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in
    income tax expense.

The Company’s annual provision for income taxes and
    determination of the related balance sheet accounts requires
    management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding
    outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad
    range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to
    complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing
    jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and
    potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain.
    Management must make judgments currently about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax
    assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs,
    future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and
    liabilities may be necessary.

The Company also is required to assess the realizability of its
    deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the
    Company’s forecast of future taxable income, available net
    operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning
    strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax
    assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the
    need for, and amount of, valuation allowances against the
    Company’s deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and
    circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation
    allowances may be required.

Recently
    Issued Financial Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). In February 2008, the FASB
    issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provides a one year deferral of the effective date of
    SFAS 157 for fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets
    and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items recognized or
    disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis (at least
    annually). The deferral applies to fair value in goodwill
    impairment testing, indefinite-lived intangible assets measured
    at fair value for impairment testing, asset retirement
    obligations initially measured at fair value, and nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair
    value in a business combination. Therefore, the Company has
    adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to its
    financial assets and liabilities only. SFAS 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
    under U.S. GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value
    measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS 157 as the
    exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

SFAS 157 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure
    of the inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value. This
    hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
    follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2
    inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
    liability, either directly or indirectly through market
    corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on
    the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and
    liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s
    classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
    lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

At December 31, 2008, $0.3 million of the
    Company’s cash and cash equivalents and $4.2 million
    of marketable securities are valued as level 1 investments.
    The Company held $8.5 million valued as level 2
    investments in the investments and other assets line of the
    consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not
    material.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”). This
    statement significantly changes the financial accounting and
    reporting of business combination transactions in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008 and prohibits early adoption. Upon adoption, SFAS 141R
    will not have a significant impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows. However, depending on the nature of an acquisition or the
    quantity of acquisitions entered into after the adoption,
    SFAS 141R may significantly impact the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows when compared to acquisitions accounted for under existing
    U.S. GAAP and result in more earnings volatility and
    generally lower earnings due to, among other items, the
    expensing of deal costs and restructuring costs of acquired
    companies.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 08-7,

Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets

(EITF 08-7).

EITF 08-7

clarifies how to account for acquired defensive intangible
    assets subsequent to initial measurement under SFAS 141R
    that the Company does not intend to actively use but does intend
    to hold to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset.

EITF 08-7

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, along with SFAS 141R. The Company has evaluated

EITF 08-7

and does not expect the adoption of

EITF 08-7

to have a material impact on its consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 significantly
    changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling
    (minority) interests in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early
    adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption of
    SFAS 160 to have an impact on its consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows.

3.   Fourth
    Quarter of 2008 Restructuring Charges and Asset
    Write-Downs

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax
    charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of
    reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted
    share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee
    reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well
    as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the
    $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the
    restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in
    cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges
    and asset write-downs were recorded in Selling, general and
    administrative expenses. The restructuring charges and asset
    write-downs were reported in segment operating income as
    follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG
    and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other
    expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and
    facility closures relate to plans established by the Company in
    2008 as part of cost reduction initiatives to be broadly
    implemented across the Company’s various businesses during
    fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs resulted from the
    consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of
    production to low cost locales and a general reduction in
    workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes
    in certain for the Company’s businesses. The Company
    recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance
    costs for slightly more than 10% of the Company’s
    workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of
    $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with
    the closure of certain facilities in 2009. Substantially all of
    the payments for employee severance and lease termination costs
    are expected to made in 2009.

    expands the Company’s position in the niche market for
    programmable power sources and provides the Company with further
    opportunities for growth in the electronic test and measurement
    equipment market. The Muirhead acquisition expands the
    Company’s penetration in motion control products for the
    aerospace and defense markets, including actuators and other
    specialized linear motors, complementing our existing technical
    motor capabilities. No goodwill recorded as a part of the 2008
    acquisitions will be deductible in future years for tax purposes.

The Company is in the process of conducting third-party
    valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired,
    as well as finalizing restructuring plans for certain
    acquisitions. Adjustments to the allocation of purchase price
    will be recorded when this information is finalized. Therefore,
    the allocation of the purchase price is subject to revision.

The valuations for the $136.7 million preliminarily
    assigned to other intangible assets, related to the 2008
    acquisitions, currently are being finalized by third-party
    appraisers. In connection with the finalization of the 2007
    acquisitions, $109.1 million was assigned to intangible
    assets, which consisted primarily of patents, technology,
    customer relationships and trade names with estimated lives
    ranging from six to 20 years.

In 2007, the Company spent $300.6 million in cash, net of
    cash acquired, for seven acquisitions and one small technology
    line. The acquisitions include Seacon Phoenix, subsequently
    renamed AMETEK SCP, Inc. (“SCP”), in April 2007,
    Advanced Industries, Inc. (“Advanced”), B&S
    Aircraft Parts and Accessories (“B&S”) and
    Hamilton Precision Metals (“Hamilton”) in June 2007,

    especially strong position in the high-power segment. Advanced,
    B&S, Cameca and California Instruments are part of EIG and
    SCP, Hamilton and Umeco R&O are part of EMG.

Had the 2008 acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2008,
    unaudited pro forma net sales, net income and diluted earnings
    per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 would not
    have been materially different than the amounts reported.

Had the 2008 acquisitions and the 2007 acquisitions been made at

Maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31,
    2008 were as follows: $89.9 million in 2010;
    $1.4 million in 2011; $61.3 million in 2012;
    $1.9 million in 2013; $1.2 million in 2014; and
    $937.6 million in 2015 and thereafter.

In July 2008, the Company repaid the $225 million
    7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from
    borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September
    2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due
    September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second
    funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million,
    consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due
    December 2018. The senior notes carry a weighted average
    interest rate of 6.93%. The proceeds from the senior notes were
    used to pay down a portion of the Company’s revolving
    credit facility.

In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private
    placement agreement to sell $450 million in senior notes to
    a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates
    for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in December
    2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due
    December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second
    funding occurred in July 2008 for $80 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018. The
    notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 6.25%. The
    proceeds from the first funding of the notes were used to pay
    down the Company’s revolving credit facility, which
    included a foreign

portion related to the 2007 acquisition of Cameca and the 2006
    acquisition of Land Instruments, as well as borrowings
    outstanding under the Company’s accounts receivable
    securitization program. Additionally, the proceeds from the
    private placement were used to purchase California Instruments
    in December 2007. The proceeds from the second funding of the
    notes were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s
    revolving credit facility.

At December 31, 2008, the Company has an outstanding
    11.3 million British pound ($16.4 million at
    December 31, 2008) 3.52% (London Interbank Offered
    Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.69%) floating-rate term loan
    with annual installment payments due through December 2010. In
    September 2005, the Company issued a 50 million Euro
    ($69.8 million at December 31,
    2008) 3.94% senior note due August 2015. In November
    2004, the Company issued a 40 million British pound
    ($58.4 million at December 31,
    2008) 5.99% senior note due in November 2016. In
    September 2003, the Company issued a 50 million British
    pound ($73.0 million at December 31,
    2008) 5.96% senior note due in September 2010.

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization facility
    agreement with a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary and
    the special-purpose subsidiary has a receivables sale agreement
    with a bank, whereby it can sell to a third party up to
    $100.0 million of its trade accounts receivable on a
    revolving basis. The securitization facility is a financing
    vehicle utilized by the Company because it can offer attractive
    rates relative to other financing sources. When borrowings are
    outstanding under the facility, all securitized accounts
    receivable and related debt are reflected on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

The special-purpose subsidiary is the servicer of the accounts
    receivable under the securitization facility. The accounts
    receivable securitization facility was amended and restated in
    May 2008, extending the expiration date from May 2008 to May
    2009, and bringing the borrowing capacity to $100 million,
    from $110 million previously. The Company intends to renew
    the securitization facility on an annual basis. Interest rates
    on amounts drawn down are based on prevailing market rates for
    short-term commercial paper plus a program fee. The Company also
    pays a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the
    securitization facility. The Company’s accounts receivable
    securitization is accounted for as a secured borrowing under
    SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no
    borrowings outstanding on the accounts receivable
    securitization. Interest expense under this facility is not
    significant. The weighted average interest rate when borrowings
    were outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization
    during 2008 and 2007 was 3.6% and 5.7%, respectively.

In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility,
    increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million
    to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that
    permits the Company to request up to an additional
    $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time
    during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain
    conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility
    from October 2011 to June 2012.

The revolving credit facility places certain restrictions on
    allowable additional indebtedness. At December 31, 2008,
    the Company had available borrowing capacity of
    $468.9 million under its $550 million revolving bank
    credit facility, which includes an accordion feature allowing
    $100 million of additional borrowing capacity.

Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit
    facility are at the applicable LIBOR rate plus a negotiated
    spread, or at the U.S. prime rate. At December 31,
    2008, the Company had $65.6 million borrowings outstanding
    under the revolving credit facility, of which $58.4 million
    related to 40 million of British pounds borrowings under
    the revolver. At December 31, 2007, the Company had no
    borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The
    weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 2.81%
    and 5.82%, respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of
    credit totaling $15.5 million and $24.7 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The private placement, the floating-rate term loan, the senior
    notes, the revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable
    securitization are subject to certain customary covenants,
    including financial covenants that, among other things, require
    the Company to maintain certain

debt-to-EBITDA

and interest coverage ratios.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
    facilities with local foreign lenders of $51.0 million at
    December 31, 2008. Foreign subsidiaries had debt
    outstanding at December 31, 2008 totaling
    $44.9 million, including $33.7 million reported in
    long-term debt.

The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively.

Stockholders’
    Equity

On both January 24, 2008 and July 23, 2008, the Board
    of Directors authorized increases of $50 million for the
    repurchase of common stock for a total of $100 million in
    2008. These increases were added to the $25.9 million that
    remained available at December 31, 2007 from an existing
    $50 million authorization approved in March 2003. In 2008,
    the Company repurchased approximately 1,263,000 shares of
    common stock for $57.4 million in cash under its current
    share repurchase authorization. In 2007, the Company used cash
    of $5.4 million for the repurchase of approximately
    144,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2008,
    $68.5 million of the current share repurchase authorization
    remained available. At December 31, 2008, the Company held
    3.5 million shares in its treasury at a cost of
    $92.0 million, compared with 2.4 million shares at a
    cost of $39.3 million at December 31, 2007. The number
    of shares outstanding at December 31, 2008 was
    106.7 million shares, compared with 107.4 million
    shares at December 31, 2007.

The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
    Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one
    Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the close
    of business on June 2, 2007, and has authorized the
    issuance of one Right for each share of Common Stock of the
    Company issued between the Record Date and the Distribution
    Date. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving
    acquisition of the Company’s common stock, that holders of
    Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be entitled
    (i) to purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified
    exercise price, or (ii) to purchase shares of common stock
    of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of
    twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the Plan
    expire in June 2017.

Share-Based
    Compensation

Under the terms of the Company’s stockholder-approved
    share-based plans, incentive and non-qualified stock options and
    restricted stock awards have been, and may be, issued to the
    Company’s officers, management-level employees and members
    of its Board of Directors. In 2007, the Board of Directors and
    the Company’s stockholders approved the 2007 Omnibus
    Incentive Compensation Plan, which permits the issuance of up to
    3.5 million shares of Company common stock. Employee and
    non-employee director stock options generally vest at a rate of
    25% per year, beginning one year from the date of the grant, and
    restricted stock awards generally have a four-year cliff
    vesting. Options primarily have a maximum contractual term of
    seven years. At December 31, 2008, 8.0 million shares
    of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the
    Company’s share-based plans, including 4.0 million
    shares for stock options outstanding.

The Company issues previously unissued shares when options are
    exercised and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the
    award of restricted stock.

The Company follows the provisions of SFAS 123R.
    SFAS 123R requires companies to measure and record
    compensation expense related to all stock awards by recognizing
    the grant date fair value of the awards over their requisite
    service periods in the financial statements. For grants under
    any of the Company’s plans that are subject to graded
    vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on
    a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of

Expected stock volatility is based on the historical volatility
    of the Company’s stock. The Company used historical
    exercise data to estimate the options’ expected life, which
    represents the period of time that the options granted are
    expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the
    future option holding periods will be similar to the historical
    option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods
    within the contractual life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant.
    Compensation expense recognized for all share-based awards is
    net of estimated forfeitures. The Company’s estimated
    forfeiture rates are based on its historical experience.

Expected future pre-tax compensation expense relating to the

    December 31, 2008 is $10.2 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
    two years.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Company’s
    restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of the
    number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the
    Company’s common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock,
    the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation)
    at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of capital in
    excess of par value in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over
    the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived
    service period as determined on the grant date.

Restricted stock awards are subject to accelerated vesting due
    to certain events, including doubling of the grant price of the
    Company’s common stock as of the close of business during
    any five consecutive trading days. On May 19, 2008, the
    April 27, 2005 grant of 706,605 shares of restricted
    stock vested under this accelerated vesting provision. The
    pre-tax charge to income due to the accelerated vesting of these
    shares was $7.8 million ($7.3 million net after-tax
    charge) for the year ended December 31, 2008. On
    February 20, 2007, July 9, 2007 and October 2,
    2007, an aggregate of 472,612 shares of restricted stock
    vested under this accelerated vesting provision. The charge to
    income due to the accelerated vesting of these shares did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s earnings for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) in 2008, the Company reserved
    27,154 shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements
    and terminations were 137 shares in 2008. The total number
    of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was 282,132 as
    of December 31, 2008. Charges to expense under the SERP are
    not significant in amount and are considered pension expense

Leases
    and Other Commitments

Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases
    in effect at December 31, 2008 (principally for production
    and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to
    $74.1 million, consisting of payments of $15.3 million
    in 2009, $11.8 million in 2010, $8.1 million in 2011,
    $6.7 million in 2012, $4.6 million in 2013 and
    $27.6 million thereafter. Rental expense was
    $22.7 million in 2008, $19.1 million in 2007 and
    $15.2 million in 2006. The leases expire over a range of
    years from 2009 to 2082, with renewal or purchase options,
    subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of
    the leases.

The Company acquired a capital lease obligation in 2007 for land
    and a building. The lease has a term of 12 years, which
    began July 2006, and is payable quarterly. Property, plant and
    equipment as of December 31, 2008 includes a building of
    $13.5 million, net of $1.6 million of accumulated
    depreciation and land of $2.1 million related to this
    capital lease. Amortization of the leased assets of
    $0.7 million is included in 2008 depreciation expense.
    Future minimum lease payments are estimated to be
    $0.9 million in each of the years 2009 through 2013 and
    $10.0 million thereafter, for total minimum lease payments
    of $14.5 million, net of interest.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
    $219.9 million and $189.2 million, respectively, in
    purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of
    contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed
    prices.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no provision for
    U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
    its foreign subsidiaries, which total approximately
    $295 million. If the Company were to distribute those
    earnings to the United States, the Company would be subject to
    U.S. income taxes based on the excess of the
    U.S. statutory rate over statutory rates in the foreign
    jurisdiction and withholding taxes payable to the various
    foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the
    unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these
    undistributed earnings is not practicable.



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2008, the Company had tax benefits of
    $13.1 million related to net operating loss carryforwards,
    which will be available to offset future income taxes payable,
    subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign
    and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes net operating loss
    carryforwards of $9.2 million for federal income tax
    purposes with a valuation allowance of $8.4 million,
    $2.7 million for state income tax purposes with a valuation
    allowance of $1.6 million, and $1.2 million for
    foreign locations with a full valuation allowance. These net
    operating loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire between
    2010 and 2031. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
    $3.4 million of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain
    deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to
    be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred
    tax assets established for net operating loss carryforwards. In
    2008, the Company recorded a net reduction in goodwill of
    $0.7 million related to the utilization of net operating
    loss carryforwards. The increase of $6.7 million in the
    valuation allowance primarily relates to the impact of acquired
    net operating losses.

As disclosed in Note 1, the Company adopted the provisions
    of FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes

, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption
    of FIN 48, the Company recorded a $4.7 million
    increase in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax
    benefits, including interest and penalties of $2.4 million,
    a decrease of $1.2 million in goodwill related to a
    previous business combination and a $5.9 million charge to
    the January 1, 2007, opening balance of retained earnings.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had gross unrecognized
    tax benefits of $18.6 million, all of which would impact
    the effective tax rate if recognized. At December 31, 2007,
    the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of
    $22.7 million, of which $21.6 million, if recognized,
    would impact the effective tax rate.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to
    uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company reported
    $2.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in the
    aggregate related to interest and penalty exposure as accrued
    income tax expense in the consolidated balance sheet. During
    2008 and 2007, the Company recognized $0.8 million of
    income and $1.5 million of expense, respectively, of
    interest and penalties in the income statement.

The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the
    United States. The Company files income tax returns in various
    state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple
    legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open
    tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and
    six years in these jurisdictions. In 2008, the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) completed the audit of the
    Company’s U.S. income tax returns for

1999-2004

and is currently examining the Company’s U.S. income
    tax returns for

2005-2007.

We are also under exam in Germany for

2004-2006.

The Company has not materially extended any other statutes of
    limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and
    accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods.
    Tax years in certain state and foreign jurisdictions remain
    subject to examination; however the uncertain tax positions
    related to these jurisdictions are not considered material. In
    addition to the IRS and German audits, the Company is also
    pursuing voluntary disclosure agreements (“VDAs”)
    related to state tax issues which, if settled, could have a
    material impact on tax expense during 2009. Unrecognized tax
    benefits in total related to the audits and VDAs is
    $10.6 million at December 31, 2008. There can be no
    assurance that any portion of the unrecognized tax benefits will
    be favorably resolved.

During 2008, the Company added $11.6 million of tax,
    interest and penalties related to 2008 activity for identified
    uncertain tax positions and reversed $16.5 million of tax
    and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of
    prior uncertain positions. During 2007, the Company added
    $1.9 million of tax, interest and penalties related to 2007
    activity for identified uncertain tax positions and reversed
    $3.9 million of tax and interest related to statute
    expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.

Retirement
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Retirement
    and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
    covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
    generally provide benefits based on participants’ years of
    service

and/or

compensation. The following is a brief description of the
    Company’s retirement and pension plans.

The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
    benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
    trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
    Company’s funding policy with respect to its defined
    benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
    based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
    of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company
    estimates that it will make cash contributions of approximately
    $19 million to $24 million to its worldwide defined
    benefit pension plans in 2009.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal
    year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension
    plans as required by SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R) (“SFAS 158”)

. Prior to 2008, the Company
    used an October 1 measurement date for its three United
    Kingdom-based defined benefit pension plans. The effect of the
    elimination of the early measurement date for the three United
    Kingdom-based defined benefit pension plans was not significant.
    The recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS 158
    were adopted in 2006.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for
    eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the savings plan
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
    basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis up to six percent of eligible compensation or a maximum of
    $1,200 per participant.

The Company’s retirement and savings plan has a defined
    contribution retirement feature principally to cover
    U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after
    December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
    Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
    pre-established percentage of the covered employee’s salary
    subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the
    Company’s foreign operations participate in various local
    defined contribution plans.



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
    certain of its U.S. acquired businesses for the benefit of
    eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
    participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed six
    percent of the participant’s base compensation.

The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
    Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
    supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
    arrangements

and/or

a
    SERP covering certain current and former executives of the
    Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate
    the executive for retirement benefits that would have been
    provided under the Company’s primary retirement plan,
    except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be
    taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit
    obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be
    funded by a grant of shares of the Company’s common stock
    upon retirement or termination of the executive. The Company is
    providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the
    applicable periods.

The following tables set forth the changes in net projected
    benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the
    funded and unfunded defined benefit plans for the years ended

The fair value of plan assets for U.S. plans was
    $354.9 million and $418.3 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The expected long-term rate of
    return on these plan assets was 8.25% in 2008 and 2007. Equity
    securities included 679,200 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common
    stock with a market value of $20.5 million (5.8% of total
    plan investment assets) at December 31, 2008 and
    679,200 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market
    value of $31.8 million (7.6% of total plan investment
    assets) at December 31, 2007.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy are to maximize the plans’
    funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
    expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
    term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
    established. Since there may be periods of time where both
    equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an
    allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
    overall portfolio’s diversification and return potential.
    The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking
    into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
    streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
    actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
    established targets and ranges and is rebalanced when necessary.



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
    style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
    component.

The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets
    is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
    assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
    portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
    guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
    interest rate fluctuations.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in
    the footnote to the table above, certain investments are
    prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital,
    private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin
    trading, commodities, limited partnerships, short selling and
    rights and warrants. Foreign currency futures, options and
    forward contracts may be used to manage foreign currency
    exposure.

For the Company’s foreign defined benefit pension plans,
    the asset allocation percentages at December 31, 2008 and

Primarily cash, cash equivalents and insurance contracts.

The objective of AMETEK, Inc.’s foreign defined benefit
    plans’ investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
    rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
    level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
    of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
    different asset classes, relative to the plans’ liabilities
    and how this can be affected by diversification, and the
    relative returns available on equities, fixed-income
    investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility
    of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are
    considered. It is expected that equities will outperform
    fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the
    trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may
    better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
    relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and
    the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to
    adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward
    equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be
    reviewed, from time to time, in view of changes in market
    conditions and in the plans’ liability profile.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
    developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
    the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
    assets. This review also considered current capital market
    conditions and expectations of projected future investment
    returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
    category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
    The current low interest rate environment also influences this
    outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. and
    foreign plans remains at 8.25% and 7.00%, respectively, for 2009.

    2010 — $26,919; 2011 — $27,855;
    2012 — $29,037; 2013 — $30,167; 2014 to
    2018 — $162,851. Future benefit payments primarily
    represent amounts to be paid from pension trust assets. Amounts
    included that are to be paid from the Company’s assets are
    not significant in any individual year.

Postretirement
    Plans and Postemployment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
    pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former
    employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and
    are not significant.

The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
    certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
    retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
    employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
    retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
    compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
    invested in either, or a combination of, (a) an
    interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
    the general assets of the Company, or (b) the equivalent of
    a fund which invests in shares of the Company’s common
    stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
    plan, including income earned, was $13.6 million and
    $10.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by
    the Company and is not significant.

    It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this
    privately-held debt as pricing estimates are contingent upon
    many financial market, as well as Company specific factors. In
    conjunction, these factors can produce a wide variance of
    indicative pricing. See Note 7 for long-term debt

Reportable
    Segments and Geographic Areas Information

Descriptive
    Information about Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, EIG and
    EMG.  The Company manages, evaluates and aggregates
    its operating segments for segment reporting purposes primarily
    on the basis of product type, production processes, distribution
    methods and management organizations.

EIG produces instrumentation for various electronic applications
    used in transportation industries, including aircraft cockpit
    instruments and displays, airborne electronics systems that
    monitor and record flight and engine data, and pressure,
    temperature, flow and liquid-level sensors for commercial
    airlines and aircraft and jet engine manufacturers. EIG also
    produces analytical instrumentation for the laboratory and
    research markets, as well as instruments for food service
    equipment, measurement and monitoring instrumentation for
    various process industries and instruments and complete
    instrument panels for heavy trucks, heavy construction and
    agricultural vehicles. EIG also manufactures ultraprecise
    measurement instrumentation, as well as thermoplastic compounds
    for automotive, appliance and telecommunications applications.

EMG produces brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass
    transit, medical equipment, computer and business machine
    applications. EMG also produces high-purity metal powders and
    alloys in powder, strip and wire form for electronic components,
    aircraft and automotive products, as well as heat exchangers and
    thermal management subsystems. EMG also supplies hermetically
    sealed (moisture-proof) connectors, terminals and headers. These
    electromechanical devices are used in aerospace, defense and
    other industrial applications. Additionally, EMG produces
    air-moving electric motors and motor-blower systems for
    manufacturers of floor care appliances and outdoor power
    equipment. Sales of floor care and specialty motors represented
    12.1% in 2008, 13.7% in 2007 and 15.6% in 2006 of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales.

Measurement
    of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
    and expenses (including certain administrative and other
    expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include an
    allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
    reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and
    profits, which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are
    generally based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment
    assets include allocations directly related to the
    segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of
    investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits and deferred
    taxes.

Guarantees

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
    basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
    of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
    business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
    parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
    enhance the subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. The
    amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
    the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
    point in time. At December 31, 2008, the maximum amount of
    future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees
    was $88.5 million and the outstanding liability under
    certain of those guarantees was $24.6 million. These
    guarantees expire in 2009 through 2010.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
    transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
    compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
    unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified
    events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or retention of
    previously existing environmental, tax or employee liabilities)
    whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly
    defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such
    indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount
    of these types of



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the
    overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
    indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
    Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims
    against them in connection with their positions with the
    Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims
    related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the
    Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any,
    under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a
    material impact on its consolidated results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Product
    Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
    sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
    vary widely among the Company’s operations, but for the
    most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
    warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and
    adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
    expenses.

Changes in accrued product warranty obligation were as follows

Contingencies

Asbestos
    Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a
    defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of
    asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate
    to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not
    involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company
    or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which
    are under new ownership. In connection with many of these
    lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the
    case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these
    claims (the “Indemnified Claims”). The Indemnified
    Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such
    sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met
    their obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not
    have any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill
    their obligations in the future; however, one of these companies
    filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007. To date, no judgments
    have been rendered against the Company as a result of any
    asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong
    defenses to the claims being asserted and intends to continue to
    vigorously defend itself in these matters.

Environmental
    Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
    resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
    defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
    waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
    existing at that time, at December 31, 2008, the Company is
    named a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) at 16

non-AMETEK-owned

former waste disposal or treatment sites (the
    “non-owned” sites). The Company is identified as a
    “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the
    low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the
    amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 10 of these sites,
    the Company has reached a tentative



AMETEK,
    Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy
    its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The
    tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In
    the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate
    the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as
    estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial
    activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement
    amount. In the two remaining sites where the Company is a non-de
    minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation

and/or

related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
    have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
    expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
    issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
    this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites,
    the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
    probable remediation activities at certain of its current or
    previously owned manufacturing locations (the “owned”
    sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with
    respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established
    once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
    estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through
    the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
    feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
    instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for
    such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
    the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of
    remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current
    estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial
    statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not
    expected to result in a material change to the consolidated
    financial statements. In estimating the Company’s liability
    for remediation, the Company also considers the likely
    proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and
    the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2008 and 2007
    were $28.4 million and $25.3 million, respectively,
    for non-owned and owned sites. In 2008, the Company provided
    $7.3 million of additional reserves, including
    $5.6 million for existing sites and $1.7 million
    related to recent acquisitions. Additionally, the Company spent
    $4.2 million on environmental matters in 2008. The
    Company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 include reserves of
    $17.9 million and $18.0 million, respectively, for an
    owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005
    acquisition of HCC Industries (“HCC”). The Company is
    solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one
    of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in
    the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has
    obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from
    the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required
    remedial activities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had
    $12.4 million in receivables related to HCC for probable
    recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
    third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the
    Company is indemnified by HCC’s former owners for up to
    $19.0 million of additional costs.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain
    of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously
    owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or
    new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
    Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
    under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other
    parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental
    matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in
    all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for
    bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, as discussed further in the
    following paragraph.

In October 2008, the Company received a Notice of Administrative
    Civil Liability from the San Diego Regional Water Quality
    Control Board seeking certain penalties. The Notice claims that
    a former subsidiary of AMETEK, which became a separate company
    in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, failed to
    adequately produce a delineation report and feasibility study
    within specified time frames. We believe we have good and valid
    defenses to this claim and intend to vigorously defend
    against it.

The Company believes it has established reserves which are
    sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing
    claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe
    that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations
    in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon
    presently available information and past experience related to
    such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been
    made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not
    expected to materially affect the consolidated results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and
    procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    information, which is required to be disclosed, is accumulated
    and communicated to management in a timely manner. Under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including the Company’s principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
    of our system of disclosure controls and procedures as required
    by Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(b)

as of December 31, 2008. Based on that evaluation, the
    Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer have concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.

Such evaluation did not identify any change in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the year ended December 31, 2008 that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

    Control over Financial Reporting

    over financial reporting is included on page 39. The report
    of the independent registered public accounting firm with
