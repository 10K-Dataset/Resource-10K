Business
    Segments

Motorola reports financial results for the following three
    operating business segments:

Mobile
    Devices Segment

The Mobile Devices segment (“Mobile Devices” or the
    “segment”) designs, manufactures, sells and services
    wireless handsets with integrated software and accessory
    products, and licenses intellectual property. In 2007, the
    segment’s net sales represented 52% of the Company’s
    consolidated net sales.



Principal
    Products and Services

Our wireless subscriber products include wireless handsets with
    related software and accessory products. We also sell and
    license our intellectual property. We market our products
    worldwide to carriers and consumers through direct sales,
    distributors, dealers, retailers and, in certain markets,
    through licensees.

Our
    Industry

The overall wireless handset industry remains strong. Total
    industry shipments of wireless handsets (also referred to as
    industry “sell-in”) increased to approximately 1.14
    billion units in 2007, an increase of approximately 16% compared
    to 2006. Demand from new subscribers was strong in emerging
    markets, led by India and China. Replacement sales in
    highly-penetrated markets were also strong due to generally
    favorable economic conditions, as well as compelling new handset
    designs, attractive handset features and the increased roll-out
    of high-speed data networks, all creating greater demand.

Industry forecasters predict that the wireless handset industry
    will continue to grow over the next several years, although the
    annual rate of growth is expected to be in the 10% range as
    opposed to the approximately 20% average annual growth the
    industry experienced from 2003 through 2007. Continued growth is
    expected to be driven primarily by demand from new subscribers
    in emerging markets and replacement sales from the current
    subscriber base.

Our
    Strategy

Motorola seeks to be a leading supplier of wireless handsets and
    mobile experiences to customers globally. To accomplish this
    objective, our strategy is focused on improving our product
    portfolio to meet consumer demands and improving our financial
    performance. This includes transitioning to silicon and software
    platforms that enable us to lower costs, get to market faster
    and offer richer consumer experiences.

We have structured our mobile device product portfolio and
    development into four primary product segments: Mass Market,
    Feature, Multimedia and Productivity. Our strategy is to offer a
    broad array of products in each of these product segments.

The Mass Market product segment focuses on voice-centric devices
    with targeted features. While this segment is maturing in North
    America, Europe and parts of Asia, it is growing significantly
    in developing regions. To address this market, we are expanding
    our handset offerings around our new W Series of handsets. These
    handsets satisfy everyday communications needs, include targeted
    features and are offered at affordable price points across all
    regions and in both CDMA and GSM technologies. The key to our
    success in the Mass Market product segment is offering products
    at competitive price points.

The Feature product segment focuses on delivering iconic,
    fashionable phones with high-end features. During 2007, we
    refreshed our flagship RAZR franchise with the RAZR2, the
    luxurious RAZR2 V8, and a RAZR classic with video playback and a
    digital audio processor music player. We are focused on building
    an enhanced portfolio of Feature phone devices that deliver
    compelling 2G and 3G mobile experiences.

The Multimedia product segment is focused on the convergence of
    voice capabilities with multimedia experiences on a single
    mobile device. In the recent past, many of our customers have
    purchased and used different devices from multiple consumer
    electronics segments to meet their lifestyle needs. In addition
    to mobile phones, they use devices such as cameras, mobile music
    and video players, mobile gaming devices and portable navigation
    devices. Increasingly, these experiences will be delivered
    through compelling applications and services on a single device.
    We are developing handsets designed to strengthen our Multimedia
    product offerings, such as the MOTOROKR Z6 and the S9 headset, a
    2008 mobile music offering. We are particularly focused on
    developing a broader offering of 3G products for the Multimedia
    product segment.

The Productivity product segment is growing as workforces around
    the world continue to demand increasingly robust wireless
    handsets and consumers want their email “on the go.”
    In 2007, we expanded our Q franchise across all regions and
    major technologies with the launch of the GSM Q8 and UMTS Q9h.
    We are planning to capitalize on new opportunities in this
    growing product segment.

Throughout each of these product segments, we have increased our
    focus in our accessories portfolio to deliver complete mobile
    experiences and to complement the features and functionalities
    of the wireless handsets.



Additionally, we are expanding our accessory compatibility
    across all brands of wireless handsets and

Bluetooth-enabled

devices.

We are investing in next-generation technologies, such as WiMAX,
    HSDPA and Long Term Evolution (“LTE”). We believe a
    strong intellectual property portfolio is critical to our
    long-term success and to ensuring that we maintain a favorable
    strategic position in these technologies. We will continue to
    identify opportunities to generate licensing revenue from these
    investments. We also believe that innovation is critical to
    offering devices that demonstrate unique experiences and value
    propositions for consumers. As an example, in 2007 we began
    shipping our flagship RAZR2 devices with Crystal Talk, a
    proprietary technology that automatically adjusts audio quality
    based on ambient noise conditions to provide the optimal
    conversational experience. In application services, we continue
    to work with third parties to improve upon and develop our
    services and applications, which will deliver rich experiences
    to the customer. Motorola is committed to investing in evolving
    technologies to ensure that we continue to deliver enhanced and
    differentiated wireless handset experiences to consumers.

In January 2008, we announced that we are evaluating
    alternatives for the structural and strategic realignment of our
    Mobile Devices business to better equip it to recapture global
    market leadership and to enhance shareholder value. This may
    include the separation of the Mobile Devices business from
    Motorola’s other businesses to permit each to grow and
    better serve their customers.

Customers

We continue to focus on strengthening our relationships with our
    customers. The segment has several large customers worldwide,
    the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse
    effect on the segment’s business. The largest of the
    segment’s end customers (including sales through
    distributors) are Sprint Nextel, AT&T, Verizon, China
    Mobile and America Movil. In 2007, aggregate net sales to these
    five customers represented approximately 42% of the
    segment’s net sales.

In addition to selling directly to carriers and operators, our
    Mobile Devices business also sells products through a variety of
    third-party distributors and retailers, which account for
    approximately 33% of the segment’s net sales. The largest
    of these distributors is Brightstar Corporation.

The U.S. market continued to be the segment’s largest
    individual market, accounting for approximately 46% of the
    segment’s net sales in 2007, compared to approximately 35%
    of the segment’s net sales in 2006. Approximately 54% of
    the segment’s net sales in 2007 were to markets outside the
    U.S., the largest of which were Brazil, China and Mexico.
    Compared to 2006, the segment experienced sales declines in each
    of its four major sales regions: Asia, the Europe, Middle East
    and Africa region (“EMEA”), North America and Latin
    America.

Competition

The segment believes its overall market share for the full year
    2007 was approximately 14%, making it the third-largest
    worldwide supplier of wireless handsets. The segment experiences
    intense competition in worldwide markets from numerous global
    competitors, including some of the world’s largest
    companies, such as Nokia, Samsung,

Sony-Ericsson

and LG. In 2007, consolidation in the wireless handset industry
    slowed compared to previous years, and the five largest vendors
    together held an aggregate market share of approximately 83%,
    compared to 84% at the end of 2006. During 2007, regulatory
    changes in China precipitated a substantial increase in the
    number of manufacturers producing handsets in that market. The
    increased competition, primarily in the very low tier of the
    Mass Market product segment, has impacted shipment volumes in
    China for global vendors, as local vendors gained market share
    in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Major competitors in the industry are moving to applications and
    services as key sources of value and are increasing their focus
    and investments in these areas. In response, Motorola has
    created a global applications and services team within the
    Mobile Devices segment to focus on building the applications and
    services business.

General competitive factors in the market for the segment’s
    products include: design; time-to-market; brand awareness;
    technology offered; price; product proposition, performance,
    quality, delivery and warranty; the quality and availability of
    service; and relationships with key customers.



Payment
    Terms

The segment’s customers and distributors buy from us
    regularly with payment terms that are competitive with current
    industry practices. These terms vary globally and generally
    range from cash-with-order to 60 days. Extended payment
    terms beyond 60 days are provided to customers on a limited
    basis. A customer’s outstanding credit at any point in time
    is limited to a predetermined amount as established by the
    Company.

Regulatory
    Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
    allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and
    other countries, and limited spectrum space is allocated to
    wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal
    communications industry may be affected if adequate frequencies
    are not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are not
    developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated
    for such use. Industry growth may also be affected by the cost
    of the new licenses required to use frequencies and any related
    frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
    new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
    offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
    systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as
    WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of
    their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other
    new technologies, which can be offered without spectrum license
    costs. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new
    opportunities for Motorola and our customers. In addition,
    Mobile WiMAX was recently approved as a global IMT
    (International Mobile Telecommunications) standard. This action
    lays the foundation to further expand mobile WiMAX in key bands,
    making additional spectrum available globally.

In January 2008, the Federal Communications Commission
    (“FCC”) began its auction of 700 MHz band
    spectrum licenses in the United States. This spectrum can
    carry large amounts of data across long distances and penetrate
    walls easier than higher frequencies, enhancing in-building
    coverage. The open-access conditions are intended to help foster
    innovation in handsets and applications, however the actual
    impact of the new licenses is unclear. The open access provision
    applies to approximately one-third of the U.S. spectrum being
    auctioned and prevents the licensee from blocking devices or
    applications that are compatible with the network.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $647 million at
    December 31, 2007, compared to $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2006. This decrease in backlog is primarily
    due to a decline in customer demand driven by gaps in the
    segment’s product portfolio. The 2007 backlog is believed
    to be generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
    recognized as revenue in 2008. The forward-looking estimate of
    the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may
    cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual
    Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
    operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
    relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing
    processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third
    parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Motorola is
    also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty
    and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
    terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
    subject to licenses. The protection of these licenses is also
    important to the segment’s operations. Reference is made to
    the material under the heading “Other Information” for
    additional information relating to patents and trademarks and
    research and development activities with respect to this segment.

Inventory,
    Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
    inventory in manufacturing and distribution centers in order to
    meet customer delivery requirements in a manner consistent with
    industry standards. At the end of 2007, the segment had a lower
    inventory balance than at the end of 2006. The decrease reflects
    the significant decline in sales volumes during 2007, as well as
    an ongoing emphasis on managing inventory levels.



Availability of materials and components required by the segment
    is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
    demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
    currently source certain materials and components from single
    vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
    have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Energy necessary for the segment’s manufacturing facilities
    consists primarily of electricity and natural gas, which are
    currently in generally adequate supply for the segment’s
    operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and
    freight costs are dependent on world oil prices, which increased
    significantly during 2007 and increased our manufacturing and
    shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable
    proximity to the segment’s manufacturing facilities.
    However, difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned
    items or a significant cost increase could affect the
    segment’s results.

The segment permits returns under limited circumstances to
    remain competitive with current industry practices.

The segment typically experiences higher sales in the fourth
    calendar quarter and lower sales in the first calendar quarter
    of each year due to seasonal trends in the wireless handset
    industry.

Our
    Facilities/Manufacturing

Our headquarters is located in Libertyville, Illinois. Our other
    major facilities are located in Plantation, Florida; Flensburg,
    Germany; Singapore; Beijing, Hangzhou and Tianjin, China;
    Jaguariuna, Brazil; Basingstoke, England; and Chennai, India. We
    have recently announced our intent to exit our Flensburg,
    Germany facility.

We also use several electronics manufacturing suppliers
    (“EMS”) and original design manufacturers
    (“ODM”) to enhance our ability to lower our costs
    and/or deliver products that meet consumer demands in the
    rapidly-changing technological environment. A portion of our
    handsets are manufactured either completely or substantially by
    non-affiliated EMS and ODM manufacturers and the percentage of
    total manufactured unit volume with these manufacturers
    increased moderately from 2006 to 2007.

In 2007, our handsets were primarily manufactured in Asia and we
    expect this to continue in 2008. Our largest manufacturing
    facilities are located in China, Singapore and Brazil. Each of
    these facilities serves multiple countries and regions of the
    world.

Home
    and Networks Mobility Segment

The Home and Networks Mobility segment (“Home and Networks
    Mobility” or the “segment”) designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) digital
    video, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and broadcast
    network interactive set-tops (“digital entertainment
    devices”), end-to-end video delivery solutions, broadband
    access infrastructure systems, and associated data and voice
    customer premise equipment (“broadband gateways”) to
    cable television and telecom service providers (collectively,
    referred to as the “home business”), and
    (ii) wireless access systems (“wireless
    networks”), including cellular infrastructure systems and
    wireless broadband systems, to wireless service providers. In
    2007, the segment’s net sales represented 27% of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales.

Principal
    Products and Services

In the home business, the segment is a leading provider of
    end-to-end networks used for the delivery of video, data and
    voice services over hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”)
    networks, digital subscriber line (“DSL”) and passive
    optical networks (“PON”). Our portfolio includes: MPEG
    video encoding equipment for

standard-definition

and

high-definition

television (“HDTV” or “HD”); video
    processing and multiplexing systems; and

video-on-demand,

switched digital video and conditional access solutions used by
    network operators and programmers to deliver video programming.
    We provide a broad array of digital entertainment devices
    supporting analog, digital and IP video delivery including HD
    and digital video recording (“DVR”) (together,
    “HD/DVR”) applications. We support the delivery of
    high-speed data and voice services with

head-end

and
    central office equipment, along with data and voice modems and
    gateways for HFC and DSL networks and optical line terminals for
    PON networks.

In the wireless networks business, the segment provides
    end-to-end cellular networks, including radio base stations,
    base station controllers, associated software and services,
    application platforms and third-party switching for CDMA, GSM,
    iDEN

®

and UMTS technologies. The segment also offers a portfolio of
    WiMAX products to



create mobile IP broadband access. WiMAX has the potential to
    make mobile bandwidth more affordable and accessible for
    mainstream consumer adoption.

Our products are marketed primarily to cable television
    operators, television programmers, telecom operators, wireless
    service providers and other communications providers worldwide
    and are sold primarily by our skilled sales personnel.

Our
    Industry

The home market is evolving rapidly as cable and telecom network
    operators expand their video, data and voice services (commonly
    known as the “triple play”) to grow their subscriber
    base. The competition between cable and telecom service
    providers is increasing. Telecom operators are expanding their
    broadband networks and beginning to offer advanced video and
    data services using IPTV and PON technologies. Cable operators
    are responding by expanding their investment in HD programming,
    bundling voice-over-IP services, expanding their broadband data
    service through Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications
    (“DOCSIS”) 3.0 channel bonding, and maximizing
    utilization of network bandwidth using switched digital video.

Our home business is subject to regulation by the FCC in the
    United States and other governmental communication
    regulators throughout the world. On July 1, 2007,
    regulations enacted by the FCC became effective, requiring
    separation of security functionality from cable set-tops. A full
    two-way security interface continues to be refined. Once
    developed and implemented, these changes are expected to
    increase competition and encourage the sale of set-tops and
    integrated devices, such as televisions and DVRs, that will
    allow retail customers direct access to programming.
    Traditionally, service providers have leased digital
    entertainment devices to their customers.

In the wireless networks market, the majority of installed
    cellular infrastructure systems are based on CDMA, GSM, UMTS and
    iDEN technologies. We supply systems based on each of these
    technologies and are the sole supplier of proprietary iDEN
    networks. Advanced infrastructure systems based on these
    technologies include GPRS, CDMA-1X and EDGE. In addition, some
    segments of the cellular infrastructure industry have installed,
    or are in the process of migrating to, 3G networks, which are
    high-capacity radio access wireless networks providing enhanced
    data services, improved Internet access and increased voice
    capacity. The primary 3G technologies are W-CDMA (based on
    either UMTS or Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access
    (“FOMA”) technologies) and CDMA2000 1xEVDO. We supply
    3G systems based on UMTS and CDMA 2000 1xEVDO technologies. An
    additional 3G technology standard is TD-SCDMA, driven primarily
    by the Chinese government and local Chinese vendors. We expect
    3G licenses to be awarded in China during 2008.

Industry standards bodies are in the process of defining the
    next generation of wireless broadband systems after 3G. The
    Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    (“IEEE”) is currently developing fixed and mobile
    broadband standards (802.16d and 802.16e) based on orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (“OFDM”) technology,
    which will utilize wider channels and enable triple play
    services (voice, data, video). Based upon developments in the
    802.16e standard, we expect to see the WiMAX market begin to
    develop in 2008 as several WiMAX networks come on-line and
    devices utilizing these networks become widely available. We are
    an early leader in next-generation wireless broadband products,
    including WiMAX technology.

The International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) is
    also adopting next-generation cellular wireless access standards
    (“4G”) for the cellular infrastructure industry, also
    based on OFDM technology and known commonly as Long Term
    Evolution (“LTE”). LTE has widespread industry
    support, not only from current GSM/UMTS operators, but also from
    CDMA/EV-DO based carriers. Motorola has been chosen as a trial
    supplier for a joint Verizon/Vodafone LTE trial that is
    currently underway.

Licensing bodies of governments around the world are making
    spectrum available for advanced wireless technologies, including
    4G, in recognition of growing demand for wireless broadband
    services. Currently, Motorola estimates that there are over
    1,200 licenses available worldwide for advanced wireless
    technologies, such as 802.16e, with over 800 licenses outside
    North America.

Demand for our products depends primarily on: (i) capital
    spending by providers of cellular and broadband services for
    constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their communications
    systems, and (ii) the marketing of advanced communications
    services by those providers. The amount of spending by these
    providers, and therefore a majority of our sales and
    profitability, are affected by a variety of factors, including:
    (i) the continuing trend of consolidation within the cable,
    wireline and wireless industries, (ii) the financial
    condition of operators and alternative providers, including
    their access to financing, (iii) technological
    developments, (iv) standardization



efforts that impact the deployment of new equipment,
    (v) new legislation and regulations affecting the equipment
    sold by the segment, and (vi) general economic conditions.

In 2007, the home business benefited from increased spending by
    operators on our products due to the increase in video and data
    subscribers and the deployment of advanced video platforms by
    cable operators for

HD/DVR

applications, as well as from spending by telecom operators
    upgrading their networks and adding video services. We
    expect this industry to continue to grow in 2008, driven by
    continued expansion of broadband network capacity and services.

In 2007, the overall market for traditional CDMA wireless
    networks was relatively flat and the overall markets for GSM and
    iDEN wireless networks were down. Forecasted industry trends
    point to a decline in the CDMA, GSM and iDEN markets in 2008 as
    next-generation 3G and WiMAX wireless networks are deployed.
    Sales in the overall wireless network market are expected to be
    flat, or up slightly, in 2008.

Our
    Strategy

The Home and Networks Mobility segment is focused on leadership
    in next-generation broadband solutions to accelerate the
    delivery of personal media experiences. Key elements in the
    segment’s strategy include: (i) providing for seamless
    convergence of services and applications across delivery
    platforms within the home and across wireline and wireless
    networks, (ii) innovating and optimizing our end-to-end
    network portfolio, and (iii) developing new services that
    leverage our platforms to provide revenue-generating
    applications and services to our operator customers while
    enabling consumers to experience media mobility.

In the home business, we are focused on accelerating the rate of
    digital penetration by broadband operators in North America
    through an enhanced suite of digital entertainment devices.
    These products include basic models supporting the industry
    movement to

all-digital

delivery and advanced units supporting HD/DVR functions. We are
    capitalizing on telecom operators decisions to offer IPTV to
    their subscribers globally, with products that support delivery
    of video content using both copper-outside-plant and
    fiber-to-the-premises (“FTTP”) networks. During the
    year, the segment continued to provide video infrastructure,
    FTTP access network equipment and advanced digital entertainment
    devices for the launch of Verizon’s FiOS service and is
    supplying IP interactive set-tops to leading telecommunication
    companies around the world, including AT&T, SingTel and
    Telia Sonera.

We are also enhancing and expanding our voice and data portfolio
    to offer end-to-end solutions for fixed-mobile convergence and
    next-generation converged

IP-based

voice, data and video delivery. These solutions include:
    (i) broadband gateways with support for handing off a
    mobile voice or data call to a carrier’s VoIP or data
    network, and (ii) next-generation infrastructure products
    enhancing our cable modem termination system (“CMTS”)
    and PON platforms to expand the bandwidth delivered to a home or
    business. We developed our first Femtocell gateway in 2007,
    which enables consumers to connect to a wireless service
    provider’s network via a DSL or cable broadband connection.
    We are also an industry leader in broadband infrastructure
    solutions, introducing DOCSIS 3.0 channel bonding on our CMTS
    and cable modems and commercially deploying our Gigabit PON
    platform.

In order to enhance our strategy, as well as increase our
    offerings to wireline carriers, we have completed several
    strategic acquisitions. During 2007, we completed the
    acquisition of Netopia, Inc., a broadband equipment provider for
    DSL customers, which allows for phone, TV and fast Internet
    connections. We also acquired: (i) Tut Systems, Inc., a
    leading developer of edge routing and video encoders;
    (ii) Terayon Communication Systems, Inc., a provider of
    real-time digital video networking applications to cable,
    satellite and telecommunication service providers worldwide;
    (iii) Modulus Video, Inc., a provider of MPEG-4 Advanced
    Coding compression systems designed for delivery of high-value
    video content in the IP set-top devices for the digital video,
    broadcast and satellite marketplaces; and (iv) Leapstone
    Systems, Inc., a provider of intelligent multimedia service
    delivery and content management solutions to networks operators.
    These acquisitions enhance our ability to: (i) provide
    complete solutions to operators as they deploy advanced
    services, (ii) assist operators in growing their on-demand
    content offerings, deploying switched digital video technology,
    and enabling targeted advertising solutions, and
    (iii) provide end-to-end video solutions to wireline and
    wireless operators as they add video to their service offerings.

In the wireless networks business, the segment is investing to
    be a leader in next-generation wireless broadband technologies
    with its WiMAX solution. Because of its projected quicker time
    to market, expected lower cost and expected superior
    performance, the WiMAX wireless broadband technology, which is
    based on the IEEE standard 802.16e, represents a compelling
    offering for existing operators and emerging broadband service
    providers. In 2007, the segment delivered WiMAX network
    equipment to Wateen Telecom in Pakistan and Sprint Nextel and
    Clearwire in the United States. In addition, at the end of 2007,
    the segment was participating in over



40 WiMAX trials globally. The segment is also leveraging its
    WiMAX investment to develop its LTE solution. Vodafone and
    Verizon have launched a coordinated LTE trial in 2008. Motorola
    has been selected as a supplier to support this trial with both
    infrastructure equipment and handsets.

Customers

The largest of the segment’s customers are Comcast,
    Verizon, KDDI (a service provider in Japan), China Mobile and
    Sprint Nextel. In 2007, aggregate net sales to these five
    customers represented approximately 43% of the segment’s
    net sales. The loss of any of the segment’s large customers
    could have a material adverse effect on the segment’s
    business. Further, because many of these contracts are
    long-term, the loss of a major customer could impact revenue and
    earnings over several quarters. Although sales in North America
    continued to account for a majority of the segment’s sales,
    48% of the segment’s net sales in 2007 were outside North
    America. The segment experienced sales increases in all
    geographic regions in 2007 compared to 2006.

Competition

The businesses in which the segment operates are highly
    competitive. The rapid technological changes occurring in each
    of the markets in which the segment competes are expected to
    lead to the entry of many new competitors. Competitive factors
    in the market for the segment’s products and systems
    include: technology offered; product and system performance;
    price; features; quality; delivery and availability. We believe
    that we are competitively positioned because of our solid
    relationships with major communication system operators
    worldwide, our technological leadership and our new product
    development capabilities. Price is a major area of competition
    and often impacts margins for initial system bids, particularly
    in emerging markets. Time-to-market has also been an important
    competitive factor, especially for new systems and technologies.

We compete worldwide in the market for digital entertainment
    devices for broadband networks. Based on 2007 annual sales, we
    believe we are the leading provider of digital cable and IPTV
    set-tops in North America. Our digital cable and IPTV set-tops
    compete with products from a number of different companies,
    including: (i) those that develop and sell products that
    are distributed by direct broadcast satellite service providers
    through retail channels, (ii) those that develop,
    manufacture and sell products of their own design, and
    (iii) those that license technology from us or other
    competitors. In North America, our largest competitor is Cisco.
    Other competitors in North America include ARRIS, Ericsson
    (which entered the market in 2007 via the acquisition of
    Tandberg) and Harmonic, Inc. Outside of North America, where we
    have a smaller market position, we compete with many equipment
    suppliers, including several consumer electronics companies.

The traditional competitive environment in the North American
    cable market continues to evolve. On July 1, 2007,
    regulations enacted by the FCC became effective requiring
    separation of security functionality from set-tops. To meet this
    requirement, we provide security modules to cable operators for
    use with both our own and third-party set-tops. A full two-way
    security interface specification continues to be refined. Once
    developed and implemented, these changes are expected to
    increase competition and encourage the sale of set-tops and
    integrated devices, such as televisions and DVRs, that will
    allow retail customers direct access to programming.
    Traditionally, cable service providers have leased the set-top
    to their customers.

We also compete worldwide in the market for broadband data and
    voice products. We believe that we are the leading provider of
    cable modems worldwide, competing with a number of consumer
    electronic companies and various original design manufacturers
    worldwide.

In the wireless networks market, there is widespread competition
    from numerous competitors, ranging from some of the world’s
    largest diversified companies to foreign, state-owned
    telecommunications companies to many small, specialized firms.
    Ericsson is the market leader, followed by the Nokia-Siemens
    joint venture, Alcatel-Lucent, and two vendors with similar
    market share, Motorola and Nortel. Huawei, Samsung, NEC and ZTE
    are also significant competitors.

The segment’s wireless networks business is confronting
    several factors that could impact its business, including price
    competition, continuing consolidation among competitor
    telecommunications equipment providers, a decline in our
    proprietary iDEN business, and vendor financing by competitors
    as customers continue to look to vendors as an additional source
    of financing. The market for GSM access systems has become
    particularly price competitive resulting in significant declines
    in gross margins in the market for those systems during 2006 and
    2007.



Payment
    Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement.
    Contracts for wireless networks typically include implementation
    milestones, such as delivery, installation and system
    acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to
    complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on the completion
    of the milestone. Customer payments are generally due 30 to
    60 days from the invoice date, and are typically limited to
    90 days in regions outside North America.

As required for competitive reasons, extended payment terms are
    provided to customers from time-to-time on a limited basis. The
    segment’s payment terms are consistent with industry
    practice as many of our contracts are awarded through a
    competitive bid process.

Regulatory
    Matters

Many of our products are subject to regulation by the FCC in the
    United States and other communications regulatory agencies
    around the world. In addition, our customers, and their networks
    into which our products are incorporated, are subject to
    government regulation. Government regulatory policies affecting
    either the willingness or the ability of cable and telecom
    operators, wireless operators and wireline operators to offer
    certain services, or the terms on which these operators offer
    the services and conduct their business, may have a material
    adverse affect on the segment’s results. Motorola has
    developed products using trunking and data communications
    technologies to enhance spectral efficiencies. The growth and
    results of the wireless communications industry may be affected
    by regulations relating to the access to allocated spectrum for
    wireless communications users, especially in urban areas where
    spectrum is heavily used.

Historically, reception of digital television programming from a
    cable broadband network has required a set-top with security
    technology. This security technology has limited the
    availability of set-tops to those manufactured by a few cable
    network manufacturers, including Motorola. FCC regulations
    requiring separation of security functionality from set-tops
    that are aimed at increasing competition and encouraging the
    sale of set-tops in the retail market became effective for most
    customers on July 1, 2007. Traditionally, cable service
    providers sold or leased their set-top to their customer. As the
    retail market develops for set-tops and televisions capable of
    accepting the security modules, sales of our set-tops may be
    negatively impacted.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
    new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
    offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
    systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as
    WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of
    their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other
    technologies which can be offered without spectrum license
    costs. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new
    opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

As more fully described under “Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions — Regulatory Matters” beginning on
    page 13 of this

Form 10-K,

as television transmission and reception technology transitions
    from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries
    around the world are examining, and in some cases already
    pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television
    spectrum. Certain segments of the spectrum that have
    historically been utilized for analog television have now been
    designated to support new commercial communications systems and,
    therefore, are expected to generate new business opportunities
    for Motorola in wireless and video technologies. In the U.S.,
    the FCC has begun the auction of spectrum in the 700 MHz
    band that will be reclaimed by the government in February 2009.
    License for this spectrum may be used for flexible fixed, mobile
    and broadcast applications. Although the auction winners will
    determine the best utilization of the acquired spectrum, both
    LTE and WiMAX are candidates for technology selection. In
    addition, a contiguous portion of this spectrum has generated
    interest for mobile TV applications.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $2.6 billion at
    December 31, 2007, compared to $3.2 billion at
    December 31, 2006. The 2007 order backlog is believed to be
    generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
    recognized as revenue during 2008. The forward-looking estimate
    of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that
    may cause the amount recognized to change.



Intellectual
    Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
    operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
    relating to its products, systems, technologies and
    manufacturing processes.

The segment seeks to build upon our core enabling technologies,
    such as digital compression, encryption and conditional access
    systems, and wireless

air-interface

technology in order to lead worldwide growth in the market for
    wired and wireless communications networks. Our policy is to
    protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing
    U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology
    and improvements that we consider important to the development
    of our business. We also rely on our proprietary knowledge and
    ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our
    competitive position, and will periodically seek to include our
    proprietary technologies in certain patent pools that support
    the implementation of standards. We are a founder of MPEG LA,
    the patent licensing authority established to foster broad
    deployment of MPEG-2 compliant systems. In addition, we have
    licensed our digital conditional access technology,
    DigiCipher

®

II, to other equipment suppliers and have formed joint ventures
    with Comcast for development and licensing of conditional access
    technology.

We also enter into other license agreements, both as licensor
    and licensee, covering certain products and processes with
    various companies. These license agreements require the payment
    of certain royalties that are not expected to be material to the
    segment’s financial results. Royalty and licensing fees
    vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the
    agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to
    licenses. Reference is made to the material under the heading
    “Other Information” for information relating to
    patents and trademarks and research and development activities
    with respect to this segment.

Inventory,
    Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
    inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a
    manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2007,
    the segment had lower inventory balances than at the end of
    2006, primarily due to the completion of significant project
    milestones and the sale of the embedded communications computing
    business.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
    is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
    demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
    currently source certain materials and components from single
    vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
    have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Natural gas, electricity, and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
    primary sources of energy required for our manufacturing
    operations, which are currently in generally adequate supply for
    the segments operations. In addition, the cost to operate our
    facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices,
    which increased significantly during 2007 and increased our
    manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is generally available
    in reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing
    facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the
    aforementioned items or a significant cost increase could affect
    the segment’s results.

Generally, we do not permit customers to return products, other
    than under standard warranty provisions. The segment has not
    experienced seasonal buying patterns for its products.

Our
    Facilities/Manufacturing

Our headquarters is located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. Major
    design, integration, manufacturing and distribution centers are
    located in: Arlington Heights and Schaumburg, Illinois;
    Chandler, Arizona; Fort Worth, Texas; Taipei, Taiwan;
    Nogales, Mexico; Bangalore, India; Swindon, England; Hangzhou
    and Tianjin, China; and Penang, Malaysia. In addition to our own
    manufacturing, we utilize non-affiliated electronics
    manufacturing suppliers and original design manufacturers,
    primarily in Asia, in order to enhance our ability to lower
    costs and/or deliver products that meet consumer demands.

Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions Segment

The Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment (“Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions” or the “segment”) designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and digital
    two-way radio, voice and data communications products and
    systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and
    end-to-end enterprise mobility



solutions to a wide range of enterprise markets, including
    government and public safety agencies (which, together with all
    sales to distributors of two-way communication products, is
    referred to as the “government and public safety
    market”), as well as retail, utility, transportation,
    manufacturing, healthcare and other commercial customers (which,
    collectively, are referred to as the “commercial enterprise
    market”). In 2007, the segment’s net sales represented
    21% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Principal
    Products and Services

In the government and public safety market, we are the leading
    provider of advanced mission-critical systems worldwide, with
    more than 65 years of experience in custom, rugged devices;
    public safety-grade private networks; sophisticated encryption
    technology; interoperable voice and broadband data; and complex
    network design, optimization and implementation services. In the
    commercial enterprise market, we are a global leader in
    end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions. Our products and
    solutions capture, move and manage information in real time to
    assist our customers in making more efficient business

    wireless infrastructure, and radio frequency identification
    (“RFID”) infrastructure and tags, and are sold as both
    integrated solutions and individual devices.

The segment’s products are sold through Motorola’s
    direct sales force and through independent and authorized
    distributors, dealers and value-added resellers, original
    equipment manufacturers, service operators and independent
    commission sales representatives. Distributors and value-added
    resellers may provide a service or add components in order to
    resell our product to end users. The segment’s distribution
    organization provides systems engineering and installation and
    other technical and systems management services to meet its
    customers’ particular needs. The customer may also choose
    to install and maintain the equipment with its own employees, or
    may obtain installation, service and parts from a network of the
    segment’s authorized service stations or from other
    non-Motorola service stations.

Our
    Industry

We compete in the mobile segment of the communications industry,
    providing wireless equipment infrastructure and services to
    public safety, government and enterprise customers.

Within our government and public safety market, interoperability
    and natural disaster preparedness continue to be important
    issues for our customers worldwide. We expect this industry to
    grow in the mid-to-high single digit percentage range in 2008,
    consistent with previous years. Our extensive portfolio of
    products includes advanced solutions for each of the major
    standards-based private network technologies, APCO 25
    (Association for Public Safety Communications Officials) and
    TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio), as well as biometrics and
    wireless broadband applications. We expect sales to continue to
    grow worldwide as demand for integrated, interoperable public
    safety communications increases. As new and better spectrum
    utilization evolves, we expect to see more demand and greater
    potential for data applications, such as video surveillance and
    other data-based products, in 2008 and beyond.

Within our commercial enterprise market, we believe there is a
    significant growth opportunity as the global workforce continues
    to become more mobile and the industries and markets that
    purchase our products continue to expand. The markets in which
    Motorola competes include enterprise wireless infrastructure,
    mobile computing solutions, bar code scanning, RFID solutions
    and mobile network management platforms. Organizations looking
    to increase productivity and derive benefits from mobilizing
    their applications and workforces are driving growth in this
    market, which we expect to be in the high single digits in 2008.
    With the acquisition of Symbol Technologies, Inc.
    (“Symbol”) in January 2007, Motorola is well
    positioned to compete effectively in the enterprise space.

Our
    Strategy

Motorola has been a leading provider of mission-critical systems
    in the government and public safety market worldwide for more
    than 65 years. The acquisition of Symbol is the cornerstone
    of the segment’s strategy to expand its leadership into the
    commercial enterprise market. We are using our combined scale to
    maintain and expand our leadership position in these markets
    worldwide by uniting the two companies’ adjacent assets,
    intellectual property, customer and supplier bases, and
    industry-leading products. The combination of our direct sales
    and indirect channel partners provides significant distribution
    advantages in each of the markets we serve.



In the government and public safety market, our objective is to
    maintain our leading position as the market and technology
    evolves. Key strategies include: (i) continuing investment
    in our analog radio portfolio while leading the ongoing
    migration to digital products, (ii) leveraging our wireless
    broadband portfolio to drive growth and enter new markets,
    (iii) managing the anticipated public/private convergence
    planned for potential 700MHz public safety systems in the U.S.,
    and (iv) continuing to lead the market for APCO 25 and
    TETRA standards-based voice and data networking systems around
    the world.

In the commercial enterprise market, our strategy is to deliver
    products and solutions that are designed to increase cost
    effectiveness, enhance efficiency and promote faster execution
    of critical business processes. Key strategies include offering
    a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to help
    businesses: (i) streamline their supply chains,
    (ii) improve customer service in the field,
    (iii) increase data collection accuracy, and
    (iv) enhance worker productivity.

Customers

Our products and services are sold worldwide to a diverse set of
    customers, including government and public safety agencies
    (police, fire, and emergency management services) and
    militaries, as well as retail, utility, transportation and
    logistics, manufacturing, wholesale and distribution, healthcare
    and other commercial customers. Our sales model emphasizes both
    direct sales by our in-house sales force and indirect sales
    through our channel of value-added resellers and distributors.
    We believe this dual sales approach allows us to meet customer
    needs effectively, build strong, lasting relationships and
    broaden our penetration across various markets. Our channel
    sales force allows us to increase revenues by extending the
    reach of our products and solutions to meet demand in market
    segments where our direct sales force does not sell. Resellers
    and distributors each have their own sales organizations which
    complement and extend our sales organization. With deep
    expertise about specific customers’ operations, resellers
    can be very effective in promoting sales of Motorola products.
    We believe this tiered distribution approach will allow us to
    achieve our goal of maintaining gross margin over time, as we
    drive greater scale from shipping more efficiently through
    better management of our supply chain.

The largest of the segment’s customers are the
    U.S. Government, Scansource, IBM, Ingram Micro and

Wal-Mart.

In
    2007, aggregate net sales to these five customers represented
    approximately 19% of the segment’s net sales. The loss of
    any of the segment’s largest customers may have a material
    adverse effect on the segment’s business. Further, because
    some of these contracts are long-term, the loss of a major
    customer could impact revenue and earnings over several
    quarters. Net sales to customers in North America represented
    62% of the segment’s net sales in 2007.

A majority of our sales were made directly through our in-house
    sales force. However, as noted above, a significant portion of
    our sales are made through resellers and distributors. Our
    largest resellers and distributors are Scansource, IBM and
    Ingram Micro, which primarily sell to the commercial enterprise
    market.

Competition

The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive.
    Continued evolution in the industry, as well as technological
    migration, is opening up the market to increased competition.
    Other key competitive factors include: technology offered;
    price; payment terms; availability of vendor financing; product
    and system performance; product features, quality, delivery,
    availability and warranty; the quality and availability of
    service; company image; relationship with key customers; and
    time-to-market. We believe we are uniquely positioned in the
    industry due to our strong customer relationships, our
    technological leadership and capabilities, and our range of
    offerings.

The segment experiences widespread competition in the government
    and public safety market from a growing number of new and
    existing competitors. In this market, the segment provides
    communications and information systems compliant with both
    existing industry digital standards, APCO 25 and TETRA. Major
    competitors include: M/A-Com, EADS Telecommunications, Kenwood,
    EF Johnson, Cisco and large system integrators.

Competitors in this segment may also serve as a subcontractor to
    a large system integrator and are selected based on a number of
    competitive factors and customer requirements. The segment is
    managing the impact of system integrators seeking to move
    further into the public safety area, specifically in the federal
    government market. Several other competitive factors may have an
    impact on the business, including: the consolidation among
    telecommunications equipment providers; evolving developments in
    the 700 MHz band, and increasing encroachment by broadband
    and IP solution providers. As demand for fully-integrated voice,
    data and broadband systems continues, the segment may face
    additional competition from public telecommunications carriers.



The commercial enterprise market is highly competitive and
    acutely influenced by advances in technology, industry
    standards, product improvements, new product introductions and
    price competition. Many firms are engaged in the manufacturing
    and marketing of products in bar code reading equipment,
    wireless networks and mobile computing devices. Numerous
    companies, including present manufacturers of scanners, lasers,
    optical instruments, microprocessors, wireless networks,
    notebook computers, handheld devices and telephonic and other
    communication devices, have the technical potential to compete
    with the segment. Competitors such as Intermec, Cisco and Nokia
    deliver products in certain parts of the commercial enterprise
    market.

Payment
    Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide. Generally, contract payment terms
    range from 30 to 60 days from the invoice date within North
    America and are typically limited to 90 days in regions
    outside North America. A portion of the contracts in the
    government and public safety market include implementation
    milestones, such as delivery, installation and system
    acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to
    complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on the completion
    of the milestone.

We generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required
    for competitive reasons, we may provide or work with third-party
    lenders to arrange for long-term financing in connection with
    equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the
    purchase price.

Regulatory
    Matters

The use of wireless voice, data and video communications systems
    requires radio spectrum, which is regulated by governmental
    agencies throughout the world. In the U.S., the FCC and the
    National Telecommunications and Information Administration
    (“NTIA”) regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities
    and federal entities, respectively. Similarly, countries around
    the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and
    implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum, pursuant to
    their respective national laws and international coordination
    under the International Telecommunications Union
    (“ITU”). Consequently, the business and results of
    this segment could be affected by the rules and regulations
    adopted by the FCC, NTIA or regulatory agencies in other
    countries from time to time. The availability of additional
    radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities.
    Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide
    opportunities or may require modifications to some of our
    products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.

The segment manufactures and markets products in spectrum bands
    already made available by regulatory bodies. These include voice
    and data infrastructure, mobile radios and portable or handheld
    units. Our products span the public safety, enterprise,
    commercial and consumer markets and operate both on licensed and
    unlicensed spectrum. In addition, new spectrum bands and
    modified regulations provide possible opportunities for new
    business.

As television transmission and reception technology transitions
    from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries
    around the world are examining, and in some cases already
    pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television
    spectrum. In the U.S., pursuant to federal legislation, analog
    television stations must cease operation in the broadcast
    television spectrum by February 17, 2009. The soon-to-be
    available spectrum that has historically been utilized for
    analog television (the so-called “digital dividend”
    spectrum) can provide new opportunities for Motorola and for our
    competitors. In parallel, 108 MHz of spectrum historically
    used for broadcast television is being redeveloped for new uses,
    including broadband and narrowband wireless communications.
    Under rules adopted by the FCC, this portion of the spectrum
    under redevelopment (the 700 MHz band) will support new
    commercial and public safety communications systems. As of
    February 2008, approximately 40 public safety customers are
    already implementing narrowband 700 MHz systems in areas
    where television incumbency is not an issue. Additional agencies
    are expected to deploy systems as broadcast television is
    cleared from the 700 MHz band. The FCC also has made
    provisions for a 700 MHz band nationwide public safety
    broadband network to be built over the next 10 years. In
    addition, segments of the spectrum are being auctioned for
    commercial use and Motorola could see new business opportunities
    as auction winners implement broadband systems on that spectrum.

Internationally, the ITU World Radio Conference held in Geneva
    in November 2007 identified spectrum that could be made
    available as part of a “digital dividend” as
    television transitions from analog to digital technology
    globally. Countries around the world are studying the potential
    size, timing and use of this potentially available spectrum. In
    November 2007, the European Commission issued a statement
    promoting a common European approach to its use. The United
    Kingdom has already decided to redevelop spectrum as a result of
    the digital



transition and is making available 112 MHz of spectrum
    through auctions. Canada recently released a consultation
    requesting industry input on making additional spectrum
    available for public safety use in the 700 MHz band. A
    number of other countries around the world have also indicated
    their intention to pursue the availability of digital dividend
    spectrum.

A global focus on enhancing security and “connecting the
    unconnected” is providing new opportunities for
    Motorola’s wireless broadband and RFID products. In
    addition to offering products that operate in licensed
    broadband, Motorola offers wireless broadband solutions that
    operate in bands where no license is required, providing an
    economical means for enhancing connectivity in developing
    countries. Government funding to enhance connectivity in African
    countries is fueling new opportunities for these products.
    Likewise, interest in strengthening border security and global
    tracking and security of products provides greater opportunities
    for Motorola’s RFID products.

In addition, some of our operations use substances regulated
    under various federal, state, local and international laws
    governing the environment and worker health and safety,
    including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the
    ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous
    substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
    Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state,
    local and international laws governing chemical substances in
    electronic products.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $2.3 billion as of
    December 31, 2007, compared to $2.0 billion as of
    December 31, 2006. The 2007 order backlog is believed to be
    generally firm and approximately 74% of that amount is expected
    to be recognized as revenue during 2008. The forward-looking
    estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future
    events that may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual
    Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
    operations. The segment has an extensive U.S. and
    international portfolio of patents relating to its products,
    systems, technologies and manufacturing processes, including
    recent research developments in scanning, information
    collection, network communications and network management. We
    have also filed additional patent applications in the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as in foreign
    patent offices.

The segment licenses some of its patents to third parties and
    this revenue is not significant. Motorola is also licensed to
    use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees
    vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the
    agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses.

We actively participate in the development of open standards for
    interoperable, mission-critical digital two-way radio systems.
    We have published our technology and licensed patents to
    signatories of the industry’s two primary memorandums of
    understanding defined by the Telecommunications Industry
    Association (“TIA”) Project 25 and European
    Telecommunications Standards Institute (“ETSI”)
    Terrestrial Trunked Radio (“TETRA”).

Notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents and the
    resulting potential for increased competition for certain of our
    products in the future, we believe that our extensive patent
    portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive
    advantage. Furthermore, we believe we are not dependent upon a
    single patent, or a few patents. Our success depends more upon
    our proprietary know-how, innovative skills, technical
    competence and marketing abilities. In addition, because of
    changing technology, our present intention is not to rely
    primarily on patents or other intellectual property rights to
    protect or establish our market position. However, the segment
    continues to litigate against competitors to enforce its
    intellectual property rights in certain technologies and is
    currently involved in several such lawsuits. Reference is made
    to the material under the heading “Other Information”
    for information relating to patents and trademarks and research
    and development activities with respect to this segment.

Inventory,
    Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
    inventory to meet customers’ delivery requirements in a
    manner consistent with industry standards. The segment provides
    custom products which requires the stocking of inventories and
    large varieties of piece parts and replacement parts in order to
    meet delivery and warranty requirements. To the extent
    suppliers’ product life cycles are shorter than the
    segment’s, stocking of lifetime buy



inventories is required to meet long-term warranty and
    contractual requirements. In addition, replacement parts are
    stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery
    cycle. At the end of 2007, the segment had a higher inventory
    balance than at the end of 2006, primarily as a result of the
    acquisition of Symbol during 2007.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
    is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
    demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
    currently source certain materials and components from single
    vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
    have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
    primary sources of energy for the segment’s operations,
    which are currently in generally adequate supply for the
    segment’s operations. In addition, the cost to operate our
    facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices,
    which increased significantly during 2007 and increased our
    manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is generally available
    in reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing
    facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of these
    items or a significant cost increase could affect the
    segment’s results.

Generally, the segment’s contracts do not include a right
    of return, other than for standard warranty provisions. For new
    product introductions in our government and public safety
    market, we may enter into milestone contracts providing that the
    product could be returned if we do not achieve the milestones.
    Due to buying patterns in the markets we serve, sales tend to be
    somewhat higher in the fourth quarter.

Our
    Facilities/Manufacturing

Our primary offices are located in Schaumburg, Illinois and
    Holtsville, New York. Major design, integration, manufacturing
    and distribution centers are located in: Holtsville, New York;
    Schaumburg, Illinois; Basingstoke, England; Arad, Israel;
    Tianjin, China; Taunusstein and Berlin, Germany; Reynosa,
    Mexico; McAllen, Texas; Brno, Czech Republic; and Penang,
    Malaysia. In addition to our own manufacturing, we utilize
    non-affiliated electronics manufacturing suppliers, primarily in
    Asia, in order to enhance our ability to lower costs and deliver
    products that meet consumer demands.

Other
    Information

2007 Change in Organizational
    Structure.

    Item 1 incorporates by reference Note 11,
    “Information by Segment and Geographic Region,” of
    Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data of this document.

Customers.

Motorola has
    several large customers, the loss of one or more of which could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company. Motorola’s
    largest end customers (including sales through distributors) are
    Sprint Nextel, Verizon, China Mobile, AT&T and America
    Movil. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
    Company’s net sales in 2007.

Approximately 2% of Motorola’s net sales in 2007 were to
    various branches and agencies, including the armed services, of
    the U.S. Government. All contracts with the
    U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the
    convenience of the Government.

Government contractors, including Motorola, are routinely
    subjected to numerous audits and investigations, which may be
    either civil or criminal in nature. The consequences of these
    audits and investigations may include administrative action to
    suspend business dealings with the contractor and to exclude it
    from receiving new business. In addition, Motorola, like other
    contractors, reviews aspects of its government contracting
    operations, and, where appropriate, takes corrective actions and
    makes voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Government. These
    audits and investigations could adversely affect Motorola’s
    ability to obtain new business from the U.S. Government.



Backlog.

Motorola’s
    aggregate backlog position for all Motorola segments, as of the
    end of the last two fiscal years was approximately as follows:

December 31, 2007

$

5.5 billion

December 31, 2006

$

6.6 billion

Except as previously discussed in this Item 1, the orders
    supporting the 2007 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table
    are believed to be generally firm, and approximately 89% of the
    backlog on hand at December 31, 2007 is expected to be
    recognized as revenue in 2008. The forward-looking estimate of
    the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may
    cause the amount recognized to change.

Research and
    Development.

Motorola’s business
    segments participate in very competitive industries with
    constant changes in technology. Throughout its history, Motorola
    has relied, and continues to rely, primarily on its research and
    development (“R&D”) programs for the development
    of new products, and on its production engineering capabilities
    for the improvement of existing products. Technical data and
    product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola’s
    business segments on a regular basis. Management believes,
    looking forward, that Motorola’s commitment to R&D
    programs should allow each of its segments to remain competitive.

R&D expenditures relating to new product development or
    product improvement were $4.4 billion in 2007, compared to
    $4.1 billion in 2006 and $3.6 billion in 2005.
    R&D expenditures increased 8% in 2007 as compared to 2006,
    after increasing 14% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Motorola
    continues to believe that a strong commitment to research and
    development is required to drive long-term growth. Approximately
    27,000 professional employees were engaged in such R&D
    activities during 2007.

Patents and
    Trademarks.

Motorola seeks to obtain patents
    and trademarks to protect our proprietary position whenever
    possible and practical. As of December 31, 2007, Motorola,
    Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries owned approximately
    10,064 utility and design patents in the U.S. and 12,914
    patents in foreign countries. These foreign patents are mostly
    counterparts of Motorola’s U.S. patents, but a number
    result from research conducted outside the U.S. and are
    originally filed in the country of origin. During 2007,
    Motorola, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries were granted
    696 U.S. utility and design patents. Many of the patents
    owned by Motorola are used in its operations or licensed for use
    by others, and Motorola is licensed to use certain patents owned
    by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and
    are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of
    the products subject to licenses.

Environmental Quality.

Compliance with
    federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of
    materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
    protection of the environment, has no material effect on capital
    expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of Motorola.

Employees.

At December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, there were approximately
    66,000 employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

We wish to caution the reader that the following important
    risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this
    report or our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
    could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
    stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document
    and elsewhere.

We operate in highly-competitive markets and our financial
    results will be affected if we are not able to compete
    effectively.

The markets for our products are highly competitive with respect
    to, among other factors: pricing, product features, product and
    service quality, and the time required to introduce new products
    and services. We are constantly exposed to the risk that our
    competitors may implement new technologies before we do, or may
    offer lower prices, additional products or services or other
    incentives that we cannot or will not offer. We can give no
    assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against
    existing or future competitors.

Our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new
    products and technologies and our results can be impacted by the
    effectiveness of our significant investments in new products and
    technologies.

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly
    changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, short
    product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Our success
    depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful
    introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to
    comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing
    technological and product developments carried out by our
    competitors. The research and development of new,
    technologically-advanced products is a complex and uncertain
    process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as
    well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market
    trends. We may focus our resources on technologies that do not
    become widely accepted or are not commercially viable. In
    addition, our products may contain defects or errors that are
    detected only after deployment. If our products are not
    competitive or do not work properly, our business will suffer.

Our results are subject to risks related to our significant
    investment in developing and introducing new products, such as:
    advanced wireless handsets; WiMAX; 4G technologies for wireless
    broadband networks; products for transmission of telephony and
    high-speed data over hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems;
    integrated digital radios; and integrated public safety systems.
    These risks include: (i) difficulties and delays in the
    development, production, testing and marketing of products;
    (ii) customer acceptance of products; (iii) the
    development of, approval and compliance with industry standards;
    (iv) the significant amount of resources we must devote to
    the development of new technology; and (v) the ability to
    differentiate our products and compete with other companies in
    the same markets.

Our success, in part, will be affected by our ability to
    successfully compete in the ever-evolving markets in which we
    participate. We face intense competition in these markets from
    both established companies and new entrants. Product life cycles
    can be short and new products are expensive to develop and bring
    to market.

Our evaluation of structural and strategic realignment
    alternatives for our businesses may have an adverse effect on
    business operations and our assets.

In January 2008, we announced that we are evaluating
    alternatives for the structural and strategic realignment of our
    businesses. This may include the separation of the Mobile
    Devices business from our other businesses. We have not
    determined all structural and strategic alternatives that may be
    available to us, whether we will elect to pursue any such
    strategic alternatives, or what impact any particular strategic
    alternative will have on our business operations or stock price
    if pursued. There are various uncertainties and risks relating
    to our exploration of structural and strategic alternatives that
    could have an adverse effect on our business operations or
    assets, including: (i) exploration of structural and strategic
    alternatives may distract management and disrupt operations,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results; (ii) perceived uncertainties as to our future direction
    may result in increased difficulties in recruiting and retaining
    employees, particularly highly qualified employees; (iii)
    perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may have a
    negative impact on our relationships with our customers,
    suppliers, vendors and partners and may result in the loss of
    business opportunities; (iv) the process of exploring strategic
    alternatives may be time consuming and expensive and may result
    in the loss of business opportunities; and (v) we may not be
    able to successfully achieve the benefits of any strategic
    alternative undertaken by us.



We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions.
    Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such
    actions on our business may be limited by a variety of factors.
    The cost-reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional
    production risk and have an adverse effect on our sales and
    profitability.

We have been reducing costs and simplifying our product
    portfolios in all of our businesses. We have discontinued
    product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing
    operations, increased manufacturing with third parties and
    reduced our employee population.

The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and
    profitability may be influenced by factors including, but not
    limited to: (i) our ability to successfully complete these
    ongoing efforts; (ii) our ability to generate the level of
    cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to
    effectively compete; (iii) delays in implementation of
    anticipated workforce reductions in highly-regulated locations
    outside of the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia;
    (iv) decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet
    operational targets due to the loss of employees; (v) our
    ability to retain or recruit key employees; (vi) the
    adequacy of our manufacturing capacity, including capacity
    provided by third parties; and (vii) the performance of
    other parties under contract manufacturing arrangements on which
    we rely for the manufacture of certain products, parts and
    components.

All of our businesses have consolidated or exited certain
    facilities and our products are now manufactured in fewer
    facilities than in the past. While we have business continuity
    and risk management plans in place in case capacity is
    significantly reduced or eliminated at a given facility, the
    reduced number of alternative facilities could cause the
    duration of any manufacturing disruption to be longer. As a
    result, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our
    sales and profits could decline.

The demand for our products depends on the continued growth
    of the industries in which we participate. A market decline in
    any one of these industries could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

The rate at which the portions of the telecommunications
    industry in which we participate continue to grow is critical to
    our ability to improve our overall financial performance and we
    could be negatively impacted by a slowdown. Our business was
    very negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and the
    corresponding reduction in capital spending by the
    telecommunications industry from 2001 to 2003.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world
    and, as a result, we face risks that other companies that are
    not global may not face.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and
    approximately half of our net sales are made to customers
    outside the U.S. In addition, we have many manufacturing,
    administrative and sales facilities outside the U.S. and
    more than half of our employees are employed outside the
    U.S. Most of our suppliers are outside the U.S. and
    most of our products are manufactured outside the U.S.

As with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations
    outside the U.S., we are exposed to risks that could negatively
    impact sales or profitability, including but not limited to:
    (i) tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes, customs
    classifications and certifications, including but not limited to
    changes in classifications or errors or omissions related to
    such classifications and certifications; (ii) changes in U.S.
    and non-U.S. rules related to trade, environmental, health and
    safety, technical standards & consumer protection;
    (iii) longer payment cycles; (iv) tax issues, such as
    tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to country
    and as compared to the U.S., and difficulties in repatriating
    cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;
    (v) currency fluctuations, particularly in the Euro,
    Chinese renminbi and Brazilian real; (vi) foreign exchange
    regulations, which may limit the Company’s ability to
    convert or repatriate foreign currency; (vii) challenges in
    collecting accounts receivable; (viii) cultural and
    language differences; (ix) employment regulations and local
    labor conditions; (x) difficulties protecting IP in foreign
    countries; (xi) instability in economic or political
    conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or
    anticipated military or political conflicts; (xii) natural
    disasters; (xiii) public health issues or outbreaks;
    (xiv) changes in laws or regulations that adversely impact
    benefits being received by the Company; and (xv) the impact
    of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement
    arrangements.

Many of our products that are manufactured outside the
    U.S. are manufactured in Asia. In particular, we have
    sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing
    operations, and 7% of our net sales are to customers in China.
    The legal system in China is still developing and is subject to
    change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in
    China could be adversely impacted by changes to or
    interpretation of Chinese law. Further, if manufacturing in the
    region is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly
    reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted.



We also are increasing our presence

and/or

selling more of our products in emerging markets such as India
    and Russia. We face challenges in emerging markets, including
    creating demand for our products and the negative impact of
    changes in the laws, or the interpretation of the laws, in those
    countries.

Changes in our development activities, operations or sales in
    non-U.S. markets could result in lost benefits and increase our
    cost of doing business.

The Company has entered into various agreements with

non-U.S. governments,

agencies, or similar organizations under which the Company
    receives certain benefits relating to its development
    activities, operations

and/or

sales
    in the jurisdiction. If the Company’s circumstances change
    or development activities, sales or operations are not at levels
    originally anticipated, the Company may be at risk of losing
    some or all of these benefits and increasing our cost of doing
    business.

If the quality of our products does not meet our
    customers’ expectations, then our sales and operating
    earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be adversely
    affected.

Occasionally, some of the products we sell have quality issues
    resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from
    the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be
    caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or
    suppliers. Often these issues are identified prior to the
    shipment of the products and may cause delays in shipping
    products to customers, or even the cancellation of orders by
    customers. Sometimes, we discover quality issues in the products
    after they have been shipped to our customers, distributors or
    end-users, requiring us to resolve such issues in a timely
    manner that is the least disruptive to our customers. Such
    pre-shipment and post-shipment quality issues can have legal and
    financial ramifications, including: delays in the recognition of
    revenue, loss of revenue or future orders, customer-imposed
    penalties on Motorola for failure to meet contractual
    requirements, increased costs associated with repairing or
    replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and
    brand name reputation.

In some cases, if the quality issue affects the product’s
    safety or regulatory compliance, then such a
    “defective” product may need to be recalled. Depending
    on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the
    field, it can cause the Company to incur substantial recall
    costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential
    loss of future orders, and the damage to the Company’s
    goodwill or brand/reputation. In addition, the Company may be
    required, under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for
    failed performance that might exceed the revenue that the
    Company receives from the contracts. Recalls involving
    regulatory agencies can also result in fines and additional
    costs. Finally, recalls can result in third-party litigation,
    including class action litigation by persons alleging common
    harm resulting from the purchase of the products.

If the volume of our sales decrease or do not reach projected
    targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing
    costs that may make our products less competitive.

We have negotiated favorable pricing terms with many of our
    suppliers, some of which have volume-based pricing. In the case
    of volume-based pricing arrangements, we may experience higher
    than anticipated costs if current

volume-based

purchase projections are not met. Some contracts have minimum
    purchase commitments and we may incur large financial penalties
    if these commitments are not met. We also may have unused
    production capacity if our current volume projections are not
    met, increasing our cost of production. In the future, as we
    establish new pricing terms, our volume demand could adversely
    impact future pricing from suppliers. All of these outcomes may
    result in our products being more costly to manufacture and less
    competitive.

The uncertainty of current economic and political conditions
    makes budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce demand
    for our products.

Current conditions in the domestic and global economies are
    uncertain. The U.S. involvement in Iraq and other global
    conflicts, including in the Middle East, as well as public
    health issues, have created many economic and political
    uncertainties that have impacted the global economy. As a
    result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the
    world economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate
    growth in various parts of the world economy, including the
    markets in which we participate. Because all components of our
    budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth
    in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the
    prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future
    income and expenditures difficult.

We have sizable manufacturing operations and engineering
    resources in Israel that could be disrupted as a result of
    hostilities in the region. We also sell our products and
    services throughout the Middle East and demand for our products
    and services could be adversely impacted by hostilities.



The future direction of the overall domestic and global
    economies will have a significant impact on our overall
    performance. The potential for future terrorist attacks,
    increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing
    conflicts and public health issues has created worldwide
    uncertainties that have negatively impacted, and may continue to
    negatively impact, demand for certain of our products.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to
    purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components
    to meet the demands of our customers.

Our ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on
    our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality
    materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We have
    experienced shortages in the past that have adversely affected
    our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to
    avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurances that
    we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore,
    certain of our components are available only from a single
    source or limited sources. We may not be able to diversify
    sources in a timely manner. A reduction or interruption in
    supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies
    could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form
    successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not
    develop as expected, our business may be adversely impacted.

We currently partner with industry leaders to meet customer
    product and service requirements and to develop innovative
    advances in design and technology. Some of our partnerships
    allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share
    the cost of developing next-generation technologies. Other
    partnerships allow us to offer more services and features to our
    customers. If such arrangements do not develop as expected, our
    business could be adversely impacted.

We rely on third-party distributors, representatives and
    retailers to sell certain of our products.

In addition to our own sales force, we offer our products
    through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives
    and retailers. Certain of our distributors or representatives
    may also market other products that compete with our products.
    The loss, termination or failure of one or more of our
    distributors or representatives to effectively promote our
    products, or changes in the financial or business condition of
    these distributors, representatives or retailers, could affect
    our ability to bring its products to market.

We face many risks relating to intellectual property
    rights.

Our business will be harmed if: (i) we, our customers

and/or

our
    suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property
    rights of third parties, (ii) if the intellectual property
    indemnities in our supplier agreements are inadequate to cover
    damages and losses due to infringement of third-party
    intellectual property rights by supplier products, (iii) if we
    are required to provide broad intellectual property indemnities
    to our customers, or (iv) if our intellectual property
    protection is inadequate to protect our proprietary rights.

Because our products are comprised of complex technology, much
    of which we acquire from suppliers through the purchase of
    components or licensing of software, we are often involved in or
    impacted by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual
    property rights. Third parties have asserted, and in the future
    may assert, intellectual property infringement claims against us
    and against our customers and suppliers. Defending claims may be
    expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and
    employees. If we do not succeed in any such litigation, we could
    be required to expend significant resources to pay damages,
    develop non-infringing intellectual property or to obtain
    licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of
    such litigation. However, we cannot be certain that any such
    licenses, if available at all, will be available to us on
    commercially reasonable terms. In some cases, we might be forced
    to stop delivering certain products if we or our customer or
    supplier are subject to a final injunction.

We attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property
    indemnities with our suppliers for infringement of third-party
    intellectual property rights, but there is no assurance that we
    will be successful in our negotiations or that a supplier’s
    indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by Motorola
    and our customers due to the infringing products or that a
    supplier may choose to accept a license or modify or replace its
    products with non-infringing products which would otherwise
    mitigate such damages and losses. Further, Motorola may not be
    able to participate in intellectual property litigation
    involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any
    ultimate resolution or outcome that may adversely impact
    Motorola’s sales if a court enters an injunction that
    enjoins the supplier’s products or if the International
    Trade Commission issues an exclusionary order that blocks
    Motorola products from importation into the U.S.



In addition, our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify
    them broadly from all damages and losses resulting from
    intellectual property litigation against them. Because our
    customers often derive much larger revenue streams by reselling
    or leasing our products than we generate from the same products,
    these indemnity claims by our customers have the potential to
    expose us to damages that are much higher than we would be
    exposed to if we were sued directly.

Our patent and other intellectual property rights are important
    competitive tools and may generate income under license
    agreements. We regard our intellectual property rights as
    proprietary and attempt to protect them with patents,
    copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality
    agreements and other methods. We also generally restrict access
    to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite
    these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to
    obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar
    technology independently. In addition, effective patent,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be
    unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
    Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third
    parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our
    intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our
    business.

As we expand our business, including through acquisitions, and
    compete with new competitors in new markets, the breadth and
    strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new
    areas may not be as developed as in our longer-standing
    businesses. This may expose us to a heightened risk of
    litigation and other challenges from competitors in these new
    markets.

Our future operating results may be negatively impacted if we
    are not successful in licensing our intellectual property.

As part of the business strategy of some of our business
    segments, primarily our Mobile Devices business, we generate
    revenue through the licensing of intellectual property rights.
    The licensed rights include those that are essential to
    telecommunications standards, such as the GSM standard.
    Previously

agreed-upon

terms of some of our long-standing license agreements and the
    aging of our essential patent portfolio have reduced our royalty
    revenue over the past several years and are likely to continue
    to reduce that revenue. Uncertainty in the legal environment
    makes it difficult to assure that we will be able to enter into
    new license agreements that will be sufficient to offset that
    reduction in our revenue.

Many of our components and products are designed or
    manufactured by third parties and if third-party manufacturers
    lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant
    changes in the financial or business condition of such
    third-party manufacturers, it may have a material adverse effect
    on our business.

We rely on third-party suppliers for many of the components used
    in our products and we rely on third-party manufacturers to
    manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products. If we
    are not able to engage such manufacturers with the capabilities
    or capacities required by our business, or such third parties
    lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant
    changes in the financial or business condition of such third
    parties, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We also have third-party arrangements for the design or
    manufacture of certain products, parts and components. If we are
    not able to engage such parties with the capabilities or
    capacities required by our business, or these third parties fail
    to deliver quality products, parts and components on time and at
    reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our
    orders and our sales and profits could decline.

There is no guarantee that design wins will become actual
    orders and sales.

A “design win” occurs when a customer or prospective
    customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be
    integrated with the customer’s product. There can be delays
    of several months or more between the design win and when a
    customer initiates actual orders. The design win may never
    become an actual order or sale. Further, if the customer’s
    plans change, we may commit significant resources to design wins
    that do not result in actual orders. If design wins do not
    result in actual sales, our business could be adversely affected.

We may not continue to have access to the capital markets to
    obtain long-term and short-term financing on acceptable terms
    and conditions, particularly if our credit ratings are
    downgraded.

From time to time we access the long-term and short-term capital
    markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that we can
    continue to access the capital markets in 2008 on acceptable
    terms and conditions, our access and the availability of
    acceptable terms and conditions are impacted by many factors,
    including: (i) our credit ratings, which have been lowered
    in 2007 and 2008; (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital
    markets, which has



been negatively impacted by the U.S. sub-prime mortgage
    situation; and (iii) the current state of the economy,
    including the telecommunications industry. There can be no
    assurances that we will continue to have access to the capital
    markets on terms acceptable to us.

Our debt ratings are considered “investment grade.” If
    our credit ratings were to decline two levels from the current
    Fitch and S&P ratings, the Company’s long-term debt
    would no longer be considered investment grade and our financial
    flexibility would be reduced and our cost of borrowing would
    increase. Some of the factors that impact our credit ratings,
    including the overall economic health of the telecommunications
    industry and the U.S. economy, are outside of our control. There
    can be no assurances that our current credit ratings will
    continue.

Our commercial paper is rated

“A-2/P-2/F-2.”

Our

A-2

and

F-2

ratings
    include a “watch negative.” Although we currently have
    access to the commercial paper markets, there can be no
    assurances that we will continue to have access to the
    commercial paper markets on terms acceptable to us.

We may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility
    if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing in our
    facility.

We view our existing five-year revolving domestic credit
    facility as a source of available liquidity. This facility
    contains various conditions, covenants and representations with
    which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We have
    never borrowed under this facility or previous domestic
    revolving credit facilities. However, if we wish to borrow under
    this facility in the future, there can be no assurance that we
    will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and
    representations.

We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other
    companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce
    significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to
    integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from
    the acquisitions.

In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth
    opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic
    acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
    These risks and uncertainties include: (i) the difficulty
    in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an
    efficient and effective manner; (ii) the challenges in
    achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits
    from acquisitions; (iii) the risk that our markets do not
    evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not
    prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;
    (iv) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; (v) the risk of diverting the attention of
    senior management from our operations; (vi) the risks of
    entering new markets in which we have limited experience;
    (vii) risks associated with integrating financial reporting
    and internal control systems; (viii) difficulties in
    expanding information technology systems and other business
    processes to accommodate the acquired businesses; and
    (ix) future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business.

Acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate
    may carry higher relative valuations (based on their earnings)
    than we do. This is particularly evident in software and
    services businesses. Acquiring a business that has a higher
    valuation than Motorola may be dilutive to our earnings,
    especially when the acquired business has little or no revenue.
    In addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly
    dilutive to near-term earnings and have, in the past, foregone
    certain of these acquisitions.

Key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial
    value in connection with a transaction in the form of

change-in-control

agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of
    restrictions on other equity- based compensation rights. To
    retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we
    may offer additional retention incentives, but it may still be
    difficult to retain certain key employees.

Our future operating results may be negatively impacted if we
    do not execute a successful silicon and software strategy for
    our Mobile Devices business.

As part of our ongoing effort to improve the product portfolio
    of our Mobile Devices business, we are in the process of
    transitioning our silicon and software platforms to lower our
    cost to produce devices and to enable richer consumer
    experiences. Failure to execute this transition in a timely and
    effective manner may cause us to be competitively disadvantaged
    in many areas, including but not limited to, cost, time to
    market and the ability to ramp-up production in a timely fashion
    with acceptable quality and improved/additional features.



The value of our investments in the securities of various
    companies fluctuates and it may be difficult for us to realize
    the value of these investments.

We hold a portfolio of investments in various companies. Since
    the majority of these securities represent investments in
    technology companies, the fair market values of these securities
    are subject to significant price volatility. In addition, the
    realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
    other conditions.

We also have invested in numerous privately-held companies, many
    of which can still be considered in startup or developmental
    stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for
    the technologies or products they have under development are
    typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
    could lose all or substantially all of the value of our
    investments in these companies, and in some cases have.

The Sigma Fund, an investment fund owned by the Company, holds
    U.S. Dollar-denominated debt obligations which include
    corporate bonds and asset- and mortgage-backed securities. The
    fair value of these holdings may experience temporary or
    other-than-temporary declines due to the widening credit spreads
    in several debt market segments and impairment if the underlying
    debtor should default on its obligations.

If we are unable to purchase sufficient credit insurance, our
    business may be negatively impacted.

We purchase a large amount of credit insurance to mitigate some
    of our credit risks. Our ability to sell certain of our
    receivables could be negatively impacted if we are not able to
    continue to purchase credit insurance in certain countries and
    in sufficient quantities. In addition, our success in certain
    countries may be dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient
    credit insurance.

It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of
    highly-skilled employees that are necessary to remain
    competitive.

Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology
    industries is intense. We believe that our future success
    depends in large part on our continued ability to hire,
    assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified
    engineers and other highly-skilled personnel needed to compete
    and develop successful new products. We may not be as successful
    as our competitors at recruiting, assimilating, retaining and
    utilizing these highly-skilled personnel. In particular, we may
    have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly-skilled
    personnel during periods of poor operating performance.

The unfavorable outcome of litigation pending or future
    litigation could materially impact the Company.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
    unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation. See
    “Item 3—Legal Proceedings.” There can be no
    assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation. In
    addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation and these
    costs could negatively impact our financial results.

We are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and
    safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental laws.

Our operations and the products we manufacture

and/or

sell
    are subject to a wide range of global laws. Compliance with
    existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or
    liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our
    ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and generally
    impact our financial performance. Some of these laws relate to
    the use, disposal, clean up of, and exposure to hazardous
    substances. In the United States, laws often require parties to
    fund remedial studies or action regardless of fault. Motorola
    continues to incur disposal costs and has ongoing remediation
    obligations. Changes to U.S. environmental laws or our
    discovery of additional obligations under these laws could have
    a negative impact on Motorola.

Over the last several years, laws focused on: the energy
    efficiency of electronic products and accessories; recycling of
    both electronic products and packaging; and reducing or
    eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products
    have expanded significantly. Laws pertaining to accessibility
    features of electronic products, standardization of connectors
    and power supplies, sound levels of music playing devices, and
    other aspects are also proliferating.

These laws impact our products and make it more expensive to
    manufacture and sell product. It may also be difficult to comply
    with the laws in a timely way and we may not have compliant
    products available in the quantities requested by our customers,
    thereby impacting our sales and profitability.

We expect these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate
    increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction
    or elimination of certain hazardous constituents from products,
    increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional
    accessibility.



We may provide financing and financial guarantees to our
    customers, some of which may be for significant amounts.

The competitive environment in which we operate may require us
    to provide long-term customer financing to a customer in order
    to win a contract. Customer financing arrangements may include
    all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and
    services. In some circumstances, these loans, leases and
    extended payment terms can be very large. We also provide
    revolving, short-term financing to certain customers and
    distributors that purchase our equipment. We may also assist
    customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources
    and may also provide financial guarantees on behalf of our
    customers. Our success, particularly in our infrastructure
    businesses, may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to
    provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our
    customers’ creditworthiness.

While we have generally been able to place a portion of our
    customer financings with third-party lenders, a portion of these
    financings are supported directly by us. There can be higher
    risks of default associated with some of these financings,
    particularly when provided to

start-up

operations such as local network providers, customers in
    developing countries, or customers in specific
    financing-intensive areas of the industry (such as 3G wireless
    operators). Should customers fail to meet their obligations on
    new or existing loans, losses could be incurred and such losses
    could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, our
    sales to such customers or distributors could be reduced in the
    event of real or perceived issues about the credit quality of
    the customer or distributor.

We are exposed to risks under large multi-year system
    contracts that may negatively impact our business.

We enter into large multi-year system contracts with large
    customers. This exposes us to risks, including: (i) the
    technological risks of such contracts, especially when the
    contracts involve new technology, and (ii) financial risks
    under these contracts, including the estimates inherent in
    projecting costs associated with large contracts and the related
    impact on operating results. We are also facing increasing
    competition from traditional system integrators and the defense
    industry as system contracts become larger and more complicated.
    Political developments also can impact the nature and timing of
    these large contracts.

It is important that we are able to obtain many different
    types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance
    we are forced to retain the risk.

The Company has many types of insurance coverage and also
    self-insures for some risks and obligations. The insurance
    market was disrupted after the events of September 11, 2001
    and the 2005 hurricanes. While the cost and availability of most
    insurance has stabilized, there are still certain types and
    levels of insurance that remain unavailable. Natural disasters
    and certain risks arising from securities claims and public
    liability are potential self-insured events that could
    negatively impact our financial performance.

Government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the
    growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce
    barriers to entry for new competitors.

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
    allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and
    other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to
    wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal
    communications industry may be affected: (i) by regulations
    relating to the access to allocated spectrum for wireless
    communication users, especially in urban areas, (ii) if adequate
    frequencies are not allocated, or (iii) if new technologies are
    not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently
    allocated for such use. Industry growth has been and may
    continue to be affected by the cost of new licenses required to
    use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
    new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
    offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
    systems, such as WiFi, mesh technologies and wide area network
    systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also
    deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow
    deployment of these and other technologies, which can be offered
    without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may introduce new
    competition and new opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

Changes in government policies and laws or economic
    conditions may adversely affect our financial results.

Our results may be affected by changes in trade, monetary and
    fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of
    U.S. and

non-U.S. governments,

agencies and similar organizations. Our results may also be
    affected by social and economic conditions, which impact our
    operations, including in emerging markets in Asia, India, Latin
    America and Eastern Europe, and in markets subject to ongoing
    political hostilities and war, including the Middle East.



In addition, the laws and regulations that apply directly to
    access to, or commerce on, the Internet are still evolving. We
    could be adversely affected by any such regulation in any
    country where we operate. The adoption of such measures could
    decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase
    the cost of selling such products.

Consolidations in both the cable and telecommunication
    industries may adversely impact our business.

The cable and telecommunication industries have experienced
    consolidation and this trend is expected to continue according
    to industry estimates. Industry consolidation could result in
    delays of purchases or in the selection of new suppliers by the
    merged companies. This could adversely effect equipment
    suppliers like Motorola and our competitors. Due to continuing
    consolidation within the cable and telecommunications industries
    worldwide, a small number of operators own a majority of cable
    television systems and account for a significant portion of the
    capital spending made by cable telecommunications systems
    operators.

Recent FCC regulations requiring separation of security
    functionality from set-tops could negatively impact our sales of
    set-tops.

Historically, reception of digital television programming from a
    cable broadband network has required a set-top with security
    technology. As a result, sourcing of these set-tops was
    traditionally limited to a few cable network manufacturers,
    including Motorola. FCC regulations requiring separation of
    security functionality from set-tops that are aimed to increase
    competition and encourage the sale of set-tops in the retail
    market became effective for most customers on July 1, 2007.
    Traditionally, cable service providers sold or leased the
    set-top to their customer. As the retail market develops for
    set-tops and televisions capable of accepting the security
    modules, sales of our set-tops may be negatively impacted.

We rely on complex information technology systems and
    networks to operate our business. Any significant system or
    network disruption could have a material adverse impact on our
    operations, sales and operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex
    information technology systems and networks some of which are
    within Motorola and some are outsourced. All information
    technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or
    interruption from a variety of sources, including but not
    limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts,
    natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
    failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new
    or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not
    installed properly. We have implemented various measures to
    manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but
    a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our
    operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur
    additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these
    disruptions or security breaches.

Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.

Our share price has been volatile due, in part, to generally
    volatile securities markets, and the volatility in the
    telecommunications and technology companies’ securities
    markets in particular. Factors other than our financial results
    that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to,
    market expectations of our performance, capital spending plans
    of our customers, and the level of perceived growth in the
    industries in which we participate.

The level of returns on pension and retirement plan assets
    could affect our earnings in future periods.

The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by
    the performance of the financial markets, particularly the
    equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are
    determined under government regulations and are measured each
    year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific
    date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term
    returns that are expected under the governmental funding
    calculations we could be required to make larger contributions.
    The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very
    volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution
    requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods
    of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our
    contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment,
    the likelihood of required contributions in the future increases.

The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of
    our income tax returns by the IRS could impact our financial
    results.

We are subject to continued examination of our income tax
    returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
    outcomes resulting from these examinations to



determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There
    can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing
    examinations will not have an adverse effect on future operating
    results.

We face risks related to ongoing patent-related disputes
    between Qualcomm and Broadcom.

Motorola is a purchaser of CDMA EV-DO baseband processor chips
    and chipsets from Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”),
    and we recently announced an intention to design certain of
    Qualcomm’s W-CDMA chipsets into certain of our 3G handsets.
    Qualcomm and Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”) are
    engaged in several patent-related legal actions. In certain of
    these actions, Broadcom is seeking orders to ban the importation
    into the U.S. of Qualcomm’s infringing EV-DO and
    W-CDMA baseband processor chipsets and certain
    “downstream” products that contain them (including
    Motorola handsets)

and/or

limit
    Qualcomm’s ability to provide certain services and products
    in the U.S. relating to such infringing chipsets. A final
    outcome adverse to Qualcomm in any of the patent-related legal
    actions could have a material adverse impact on Motorola’s
    performance by making it difficult, more expensive or impossible
    for Motorola to make

and/or

import products destined for the U.S. market that use
    certain infringing Qualcomm chipsets. While we continue to work
    with Qualcomm and others on contingency plans relating to these
    cases, there is no guarantee that such plans will prove
    successful or avoid further legal challenge.

Properties

Motorola’s principal executive offices are located at 1303
    East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196. Motorola also
    operates manufacturing facilities and sales offices in other
    U.S. locations and in many other countries. (See
    “Item 1: Business” for information regarding the
    location of the principal manufacturing facilities for each of
    Motorola’s business segments.) Motorola owns 43 facilities
    (manufacturing, sales, service and office), 26 of which are
    located in Americas Region (USA, Canada, Mexico and Latin
    America) and 17 of which are located in other countries.
    Motorola leases 313 facilities, 122 of which are located in
    Americas Region and 191 of which are located in other countries.

During 2007, facilities in: Guangzhou, China; Cork, Ireland;
    Arlington Heights, Illinois (Ridge Buildings); and a land parcel
    in Anderson, South Carolina were sold. Sites at Beijing, China;
    Flensburg, Germany; Glen Rock, New Jersey; Champaign, Illinois;
    and Chandler, Arizona, are currently for sale.

Motorola generally considers the productive capacity of the
    plants operated by each of its business segments to be adequate
    and sufficient for the requirements of each business group. The
    extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies
    from plant to plant and from time to time during the year.

A substantial portion of Motorola’s products are
    manufactured in Asia, primarily China, either in our own
    facilities or in the facilities of others who manufacture and
    assemble products for Motorola. If manufacturing in the region
    was disrupted, Motorola’s overall productive capacity could
    be significantly reduced.

Legal
    Proceedings

Personal
    Injury Cases

Cases
    relating to Wireless Telephone Usage

On April 19, 2001,

Farina v. Nokia, Inc., et al.,

was filed in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas,
    Philadelphia County.

Farina

claimed that the failure to
    incorporate a remote headset into cellular phones rendered the
    phones defective by exposing users to biological injury and
    health risks and sought compensatory damages and injunctive
    relief. After removal to federal court, the Judicial Panel on
    Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL Panel”) transferred

Farina

and three similar but now dismissed cases to the
    United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the
    “MDL Court”) for coordinated or consolidated pretrial
    proceedings in the matter called

In re Wireless Telephone
    Radio Frequency Emissions Products Liability Litigation

(the
    “MDL Proceeding”).

In 2005, as a result of a decision of the United States Court of
    Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the

Farina

case was
    remanded to the Pennsylvania state courts. In late 2005 and
    early 2006, plaintiffs in

Farina

amended their



complaints to add allegations that cellular telephones sold
    without headsets are defective because they present a safety
    risk when used while driving and to seek punitive damages.
    Plaintiffs in

Farina

also seek declaratory relief and
    treble and statutory damages. After the

Farina

complaint
    was amended, on February 17, 2006, a newly-added defendant
    to the

Farina

case removed the case to federal court.
    After initial consolidation with the MDL Proceeding, on
    June 11, 2007, the MDL Panel transferred

Farina

back
    to the federal district court in Philadelphia. Plaintiffs’
    motion to remand to Pennsylvania state courts was denied on
    February 13, 2008. The federal district court requested
    that defendants refile and rebrief their motions to dismiss.

On September 9, 2002,

Dahlgren v. Motorola, Inc., et
    al.,

was filed in the D.C. Superior Court containing class
    claims alleging deceptive and misleading actions by defendants
    in falsely stating that cellular phones are safe and by failing
    to disclose studies that allegedly show cellular phones can
    cause harm

. Dahlgren

seeks injunctive and equitable
    relief, actual damages, treble or statutory damages, punitive
    damages and a constructive trust. On December 9, 2005,
    plaintiff filed an amended complaint in

Dahlgren.

Defendants moved to dismiss

Dahlgren

on
    February 3, 2006. That motion is still pending.

During 2001 and 2002, several cases were filed in the Superior
    Court of the District of Columbia alleging that use of a
    cellular phone caused a malignant brain tumor

: Murray v.
    Motorola, Inc., et al.,

filed November 15, 2001,

Agro, et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al.,

filed
    February 26, 2002;

Cochran, et al. v. Audiovox
    Corporation, et al.,

filed February 26, 2002, and

Schofield, et al. v. Matsushita Electric Corporation of
    America, et al.

, filed February 26, 2002,. Each
    complaint seeks compensatory damages in excess of
    $25 million, consequential damages in excess of
    $25 million and punitive

and/or

exemplary damages in excess of $100 million. These cases
    were removed to federal court and transferred to the United
    States District Court for the District of Maryland (the
    “MDL Court”). On July 19, 2004, the MDL Court
    found that there was no federal court jurisdiction over

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

and remanded
    those cases to the Superior Court for the District of Columbia.
    On November 30, 2004, defendants moved to dismiss the

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

complaints. On
    August 24, 2007, the Superior Court for the District of
    Columbia granted the defendants’ motion and dismissed the
    cases with prejudice on federal preemption grounds. On
    September 20, 2007, plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to
    the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and that appeal is
    still pending.

Iridium-Related
    Cases

Class Action
    Securities Lawsuits

Motorola has been named as one of several defendants in putative
    class action securities lawsuits arising out of alleged
    misrepresentations or omissions regarding the Iridium satellite
    communications business which, on March 15, 2001, were
    consolidated in the federal district court in the District of
    Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications,
    Inc., et al.,

originally filed on April 22, 1999.
    Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was granted on
    January 9, 2006 and the trial is scheduled to begin on
    May 22, 2008.

Bankruptcy
    Court Lawsuit

Motorola was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
    Creditors of Iridium (the “Committee”) in the
    Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on
    July 19, 2001.

In re Iridium Operating LLC, et
    al. v. Motorola

asserts claims for breach of contract,
    warranty, fiduciary duty and fraudulent transfer and
    preferences, and seeks in excess of $4 billion in damages.
    On September 20, 2007, following trial on the solvency and
    capital adequacy portion of the Committee’s fraudulent
    transfer and preference claims, the Iridium Bankruptcy Court
    granted judgment for Motorola on all those claims. The remaining
    claims for breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty and
    equitable subordination remain pending.

On March 30, 2001, the United States Bankruptcy Court for
    the Southern District of New York presiding over the Iridium
    bankruptcy proceeding approved a settlement between the
    unsecured creditors of the Iridium Debtors and the Iridium
    Debtors’ pre-petition secured lenders. The settlement
    agreement creates and provides for the funding of a litigation
    vehicle for the purpose of pursuing litigation against Motorola.
    Motorola appealed the approval of the settlement first to the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York and thereafter to the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Second Circuit. On March 5, 2007, the Court of Appeals
    vacated the District Court order approving the settlement and
    directed that the case be remanded to the Iridium Bankruptcy
    Court for further proceedings. On June 1, 2007, the
    Unsecured Creditors Committee filed with the bankruptcy court a
    renewed motion for approval of the Settlement Agreement, to
    which Motorola objected. That motion remains pending.



Iridium
    India Lawsuits

Motorola and certain of its current and former officers and
    directors were named as defendants in a private criminal
    complaint filed by Iridium India Telecom Ltd. (“Iridium
    India”) in October 2001 in the Court of the Extra Judicial
    Magistrate, First Class, Khadki, Pune, India. The

Iridium
    India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola, Inc. et al.

complaint
    alleges that the defendants conspired to, and did, commit the
    criminal offense of “cheating” by fraudulently
    inducing Iridium India to purchase gateway equipment from
    Motorola, to acquire Iridium stock, and to invest in developing
    a market for Iridium services in India. Under the Indian penal
    code, “cheating” is punishable by imprisonment for up
    to 7 years and a fine of any amount. The court may also
    require defendants to compensate the victim for its losses,
    which the complaint estimates at about $100 million. In
    August 2003, the Bombay High Court granted Motorola’s
    petition to dismiss the criminal action against Motorola and the
    individual defendants. Iridium India has petitioned the Indian
    Supreme Court to exercise its discretion to review that
    dismissal, and that petition is pending.

In September 2002, Iridium India also filed a civil suit in the
    Bombay High Court against Motorola and Iridium. The suit alleges
    fraud, intentional misrepresentation and negligent
    misrepresentation by Motorola and Iridium in inducing Iridium
    India to purchase gateway equipment from Motorola, to acquire
    Iridium stock, and to invest in developing a market for Iridium
    services in India. Iridium India claims in excess of
    $200 million in damages and interest. Following extensive
    proceedings in the trial court and on appeal related to Iridium
    India’s motion for interim relief, Motorola has deposited
    approximately $44 million in a specially designated account
    in India, and the Indian Supreme Court has accepted for a full
    hearing at a later date Motorola’s appeal regarding interim
    relief.

Shareholder
    Derivative Case—Iridium and Telsim

M

&

C Partners III v. Galvin, et al.,

filed January 10, 2002, in the Circuit Court of Cook
    County, Illinois, is a shareholder derivative action against
    fifteen current and former members of the Motorola Board of
    Directors and Motorola as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit
    alleges that the Motorola directors breached their fiduciary
    duty to the Company

and/or

committed gross mismanagement of Motorola’s business and
    assets by allowing Motorola to engage in improper practices with
    respect to Iridium and Telsim (as defined below).

In April 2006, the Court held that the plaintiff could not
    pursue its Iridium-related claims, but denied without prejudice
    plaintiff’s motion to file a Third Amended Complaint with
    respect to new allegations pertaining to Telsim. Following the
    Court’s ruling for defendants on the Iridium-related claims
    and plaintiff’s July 20, 2006 demand with respect to
    Telsim-related claims, the Motorola Board of Directors appointed
    an investigatory committee to investigate those Telsim-related
    claims. On November 13, 2007, after considering the July
    2006 demand, proposed complaint, and recommendations made by the
    Board’s investigatory committee, the Board concluded that
    the evidence does not support M&C Partners III’s
    proposed claims and prosecution of these claims would not be in
    the best interests of Motorola’s shareholders. Accordingly,
    the Board rejected M&C Partners III’s demand.

An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the Iridium-related
    cases still pending could have a material adverse effect on
    Motorola’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
    results of operations.

Telsim-Related
    Cases

In April 2001, Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
    (“Telsim”), a wireless telephone operator in Turkey,
    defaulted on the payment of approximately $2 billion of
    loans owed to Motorola and its subsidiaries (the “Telsim
    Loans”). The Uzan family controlled Telsim until 2004 when
    an agency of the Turkish government took over control of Telsim.
    Telsim was sold by the Turkish government to Vodafone and
    Motorola received an aggregate payment from the sale of
    $910 million.



U.S.
    Judgment

The Company continues its efforts to collect on its judgment of
    $2.13 billion (the “U.S. Judgment”) for
    compensatory damages rendered by the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District
    Court”) against the Uzans on July 31, 2003 and
    affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
    Circuit (the “Second Circuit”) in 2004 and in
    connection with foreign proceedings against the Uzan family.
    However, the Company believes that the ongoing litigation,
    collection

and/or

settlement processes against the Uzan family will be very
    lengthy in light of the Uzans’ continued resistance to
    satisfy the judgments against them and their decision to violate
    various courts’ orders, including orders holding them in
    contempt of court. Following a remand from the Second Circuit of
    the U.S. Judgment, on February 8, 2006, the District
    Court awarded a judgment in favor of Motorola for
    $1 billion in punitive damages against the Uzan family and
    their co-conspirator, Antonio Luna Bettancourt. That decision
    was affirmed by the Second Circuit on November 21, 2007.

In re
    Motorola Securities Litigation

A purported class action lawsuit,

Barry Family LP v.
    Carl F. Koenemann

, was filed against the former chief
    financial officer of Motorola on December 24, 2002, in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
    SEC

Rule 10b-5.

In 2003, it was consolidated with a number of related cases as

In re Motorola Securities Litigation

in the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
    (“Illinois District Court”). During 2005, the Illinois
    District Court certified the case as a class action. In April
    2007, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant
    to which Motorola paid $190 million to the class and all
    claims against Motorola by the class have been dismissed and
    released.

Howell v.
    Motorola, Inc., et al.

A class action,

Howell v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

, was
    filed against Motorola and various of its directors, officers
    and employees in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of Illinois (“Illinois District
    Court”) on July 21, 2003, alleging breach of fiduciary
    duty and violations of the Employment Retirement Income Security
    Act (“ERISA”). The complaint alleged that the
    defendants had improperly permitted participants in the Motorola
    401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase or hold shares of
    common stock of Motorola because the price of Motorola’s
    stock was artificially inflated by a failure to disclose vendor
    financing to Telsim in connection with the sale of
    telecommunications equipment by Motorola. The plaintiff sought
    to represent a class of participants in the Plan and sought an
    unspecified amount of damages. On September 30, 2005, the
    district court dismissed the second amended complaint filed on
    October 15, 2004 (the “Howell Complaint”). Three
    new purported lead plaintiffs have since intervened in the case,
    and have filed a motion for class certification seeking to
    represent a class of Plan participants. On September 28,
    2007, the Illinois District Court granted the motion for class
    certification but narrowed the requested scope of the class. On
    October 25, 2007, the Illinois District Court modified the
    scope of the class, granted summary judgment dismissing two of
    the individually-named defendants in light of the narrowed
    class, and ruled that the judgment as to the original named
    plaintiff, Howell, would be immediately appealable. The class as
    certified includes all Plan participants for whose individual
    accounts the Plan purchased

and/or

held
    shares of Motorola common stock from May 16, 2000 through
    May 14, 2001, with certain exclusions. On February 15, 2008
    plaintiffs and defendants each filed motions for summary
    judgment in the Illinois District Court. On February 22, 2008
    the appellate court granted defendants’ motion for leave to
    appeal from the Illinois District Court’s

class-certification

decision. In addition, the original named plaintiff, Howell, has
    appealed the dismissal of his claim.

Silverman/Williams
    Federal Securities Lawsuits and Related Derivative
    Matters

A purported class action lawsuit on behalf of the purchasers of
    Motorola securities between July 19, 2006 and
    January 5, 2007,

Silverman v. Motorola, Inc., et
    al

., was filed against the Company and certain current and
    former officers and directors of the Company on August 9,
    2007, in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Illinois. The complaint alleges violations of
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
    SEC

Rule 10b-5

as well as, in the case of the individual defendants, the
    control person provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. The
    factual assertions in the complaint consist primarily of the
    allegation that the defendants knowingly made incorrect
    statements concerning Motorola’s projected revenues for the
    third and fourth quarter of 2006. The complaint seeks
    unspecified damages and other relief relating to the purported
    inflation in the price of Motorola shares during the class
    period. An amended complaint was filed December 20, 2007.



In addition, on August 24, 2007, two lawsuits were filed as
    purportedly derivative actions on behalf of Motorola,

Williams v. Zander, et al.

, and

Cinotto v.
    Zander, et al.

, in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
    Illinois against the Company and certain of its current and
    former officers and directors. These complaints make similar
    factual allegations to those made in the

Silverman

complaint and assert causes of action for breach of fiduciary
    duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate
    assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek unspecified
    damages associated with the alleged loss to the Company deriving
    from the defendants’ actions and demand that Motorola make
    a number of changes to its internal procedures. An amended
    complaint was filed on December 14, 2007, and defendants
    moved to dismiss that complaint in January 2008.

Charter
    Communications Class Action Securities
    Litigation

On August 5, 2002, Stoneridge Investment Partners LLC filed
    a purported class action in the United States District Court for
    the Eastern District of Missouri (“District Court”)
    against Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) and
    certain of its officers, alleging violations of
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to Charter securities. This
    complaint did not name Motorola as a defendant, but asserted
    that Charter and the other named defendants had violated the
    securities laws in connection with,

inter alia,

a
    transaction with Motorola. On August 5, 2003, the plaintiff
    amended its complaint to add Motorola, Inc. as a defendant. As
    to Motorola, the amended complaint alleged a claim under
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5(a)-(c)

promulgated thereunder relating to Charter securities and seeks
    an award of compensatory damages. The District Court issued a
    final judgment dismissing Motorola from the case which plaintiff
    appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
    Circuit (“Court of Appeals”). On April 11, 2006,
    the Court of Appeals affirmed the final judgment of the District
    Court dismissing Motorola from the case. On January 15,
    2008, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of
    Appeals.

In re
    Adelphia Communications Corp. Securities and Derivative
    Litigation

On December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a defendant in
    two cases relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
    Securities and Derivative Litigation

(the “Adelphia
    MDL”). The Adelphia MDL consists of at least fourteen
    individual cases and one purported class action that were filed
    in or have been transferred to the United States District Court
    for the Southern District of New York. First, Motorola was named
    as a defendant in the Second Amended Complaint in the individual
    case of

W.R. Huff Asset Management Co. L.L.C. v.
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, et al.

(the “Huff
    Complaint”) This case was originally filed by W.R. Huff
    Asset Management Co. L.L.C. on June 7, 2002, in the United
    States District Court for the Western District of New York and
    was subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New
    York as related to the Adelphia MDL. Motorola and several other
    individual and corporate defendants are named in the amended
    complaint.

As to Motorola, the complaint alleges a claim arising under
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to Adelphia securities, and
    seeks recovery of the consideration paid by plaintiff for
    Adelphia debt securities, compensatory damages, costs and
    expenses of litigation and other relief. Motorola filed a motion
    to dismiss this complaint on March 8, 2004, which is
    awaiting decision.

Also on December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a
    defendant in

Stocke v. John J. Rigas, et al.

This
    case was originally filed in Pennsylvania and was subsequently
    transferred to the Southern District of New York as related to
    the Adelphia MDL. Motorola and several other individual and
    corporate defendants are named in the amended complaint. As to
    Motorola, the complaint generally makes the same allegations as
    the

Huff

Complaint and a state law claim of aiding and
    abetting fraud relating to Adelphia securities. The complaint
    seeks return of the consideration paid by plaintiff for Adelphia
    securities, punitive damages and other relief. Motorola filed a
    motion to dismiss this complaint on April 12, 2004, which
    is awaiting decision.

On July 23, 2004, Motorola was named as a defendant in

Argent Classic Convertible Arbitrage Fund L.P., et
    al. v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., et al.

(the
    “Argent Complaint”). The Argent Complaint was filed
    against Scientific Atlanta and Motorola in the Southern District
    of New York. The Argent Complaint generally makes the same
    allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases relating to
    the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp. Securities and
    Derivative Litigation

that have been transferred to the
    Southern District of New York. The complaint seeks compensatory
    damages and other relief. Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the
    Argent Complaint on October 12, 2004, which is awaiting
    decision.

On September 14, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
    filed in state court in Los Angeles, California, naming Motorola
    and Scientific-Atlanta and certain officers of
    Scientific-Atlanta,

Los Angeles County Employees Retirement
    Association et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

The
    complaint raises claims under California law for aiding



and abetting fraud and conspiracy to defraud and generally makes
    the same allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases
    relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
    Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have been
    transferred to the Southern District of New York. There are no
    new substantive allegations. The complaint seeks compensatory
    damages, opportunity-cost damages, punitive and other exemplary
    damages and other relief. In late 2004, the Multi-District
    Litigation Panel transferred the case to federal court in New
    York, which transfer is now final. Motorola filed a motion to
    dismiss the complaint in this action on September 19, 2005,
    which is awaiting decision.

On October 25, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
    filed in state court in Fulton County, Georgia, naming Motorola
    and Scientific-Atlanta and certain officers of
    Scientific-Atlanta,

AIG DKR SoundShore Holdings, Ltd., et
    al. v. Scientific-Atlanta Inc., et al.

The complaint
    raises claims under Georgia law of conspiracy to defraud and
    generally makes the same allegations as the other previously
    disclosed cases relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications
    Corp. Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have already
    been filed and transferred to the Southern District of New York.
    The complaint seeks damages and statutory compensation, punitive
    damages and other relief. On April 18, 2005, the
    Multi-District Litigation Panel issued a final order
    transferring the case to New York and that transfer is final.
    Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in this action
    on September 19, 2005, which is awaiting decision.

Adelphia
    Communications Corp.—Bankruptcy Court Lawsuit

On June 23, 2006, Adelphia objected to Motorola’s
    claim for payment of $67 million and asserted causes of
    action against Motorola including preferences, avoidance of
    liens, fraudulent transfers, equitable subordination and aiding
    and abetting fraud as part of the ongoing

Adelphia

bankruptcy action in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
    District of New York. Plaintiff is alleging damages in excess of
    $1 billion against Motorola for the above-stated causes of
    action.

Intellectual
    Property Related Cases

Tessera,
    Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

Motorola is a purchaser of semiconductor chips with certain ball
    grid array (“BGA”) packaging from suppliers including
    Qualcomm, Inc. (“Qualcomm”), Freescale Semiconductor,
    Inc. (“Freescale Semiconductor”), ATI Technologies,
    Inc. (“ATI”), Spansion Inc. (“Spansion”),
    and STMicroelectronics N.V. (“STMicro”). On
    April 17, 2007, Tessera, Inc. (“Tessera”) filed
    patent infringement legal actions against Qualcomm, Freescale
    Semiconductor, ATI, Spansion, STMicro and Motorola in the
    U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”)
    (In the Matter of Certain Semiconductor Chips with Minimized
    Chip Package Size and Products Containing Same, Inv.

No. 337-TA-605)

and the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas,

Tessera, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., Qualcomm, Inc., Freescale
    Semiconductor, Inc. and ATI Technologies, Inc.

, alleging
    that certain BGA packaged semiconductors infringe patents that
    Tessera claims to own. Tessera is seeking orders to ban the
    importation into the U.S. of certain semiconductor chips
    with BGA packaging and certain “downstream” products
    that contain them (including Motorola products)

and/or

limit
    suppliers’ ability to provide certain services and products
    or take certain actions in the U.S. relating to the
    packaged chips. The patent claims being asserted by Tessera are
    subject to reexamination proceedings in the U.S. Patent and
    Trademark Office (“PTO”). In the reexamination
    proceedings, the PTO has issued rejections of Tessera’s
    asserted patent claims. On February 26, 2008, the ITC
    action was stayed pending the completion of the PTO’s
    reexamination proceedings.

Motorola is a defendant in various other suits, claims and
    investigations that arise in the normal course of business. In
    the opinion of management, and other than discussed above with
    respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate disposition of the
    Company’s pending legal proceedings will not have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

    on December 31, 2002 and also assumes the reinvestment of
    dividends. This graph assumes reinvestment of the Company’s
    distribution to its shareholders of 0.110415 shares of
    Class B common stock of Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.
    (“Freescale Class B Shares”) on December 2,
    2004 for each share of Motorola common stock. For purposes of
    this graph, the Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. distribution is
    treated as a non-taxable cash dividend of $2.06 (the value of
    0.110415 Freescale Class B Shares, based on Freescale
    Semiconductor’s December 2, 2004 closing price of
    $18.69) that would have been reinvested in Motorola common stock
    at the close of business on December 2, 2004.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Item 7: Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial
    position and results of operations for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2007. This commentary
    should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
    statements and the notes thereto which appear beginning under
    “Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.”

Executive
    Overview

What
    businesses are we in?

Motorola reports financial results for the following three
    operating business segments:

•

The

Mobile Devices

segment designs, manufactures, sells
    and services wireless handsets with integrated software and
    accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. The
    segment’s net sales in 2007 were $19.0 billion,
    representing 52% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

•

The

Home and Networks Mobility

segment designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) digital
    video, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and broadcast
    network interactive set-tops (“digital entertainment
    devices”),

end-to-end

video delivery solutions, broadband access infrastructure
    systems, and associated data and voice customer premise
    equipment (“broadband gateways”) to cable television
    and telecom service providers (collectively, referred to as the
    “home business”), and (ii) wireless access systems
    (“wireless networks”), including cellular
    infrastructure systems and wireless broadband systems, to
    wireless service providers. The segment’s net sales in 2007
    were $10.0 billion, representing 27% of the Company’s
    consolidated net sales.

•

The

Enterprise Mobility Solutions

segment designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and digital
    two-way radio, voice and data communications products and
    systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and
    end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions to a wide range of
    enterprise markets, including government and public safety
    agencies (which, together with all sales for distributors of
    two-way communication products, are referred to as the
    “government and public safety market”), as well as
    retail, utility, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare and
    other commercial customers (which, collectively, are referred to
    as the “commercial enterprise market”). The
    segment’s net sales in 2007 were $7.7 billion,
    representing 21% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

What were
    our 2007 financial results?

•

Net Sales were $36.6 Billion:

Our net sales
    were $36.6 billion in 2007, down 15% compared to net sales
    of $42.8 billion in 2006. Net sales decreased 33% in the
    Mobile Devices segment, increased 9% in the Home and Networks
    Mobility segment and increased 43% in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segment.

•

Operating Loss of $553 Million:

We incurred an
    operating loss of $553 million in 2007, compared to
    operating earnings of $4.1 billion in 2006. Operating
    margin was (1.5)% of net sales in 2007, compared to 9.6% of net
    sales in 2006.

•

Loss from Continuing Operations of $105 Million, or $0.05 per
    Share:

We incurred a loss from continuing
    operations of $105 million, or $0.05 per diluted common
    share, in 2007, compared to earnings from continuing operations
    of $3.3 billion, or $1.30 per diluted common share, in 2006.

•

Operating Cash Flow of $785 Million:

We
    generated operating cash flow of $785 million in 2007,
    compared to operating cash flow of $3.5 billion in 2006.

•

171.2 Million Shares of Motorola Common Stock
    Repurchased for $3.0 Billion:

During 2007, the
    Company repurchased 171.2 million of its common shares for
    an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion. Since the inception of
    its first-ever share repurchase program in May 2005, the Company
    has repurchased 384.6 million of its common shares for an
    aggregate cost of $7.7 billion.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

What were
    the financial results for our three operating business segments
    in 2007?

•

In Our Mobile Devices Business:

Net sales were
    $19.0 billion in 2007, a decrease of 33% compared to
    net sales of $28.4 billion in 2006. The business incurred
    an operating loss of $1.2 billion in 2007, compared to
    operating earnings of $2.7 billion in 2006. The business
    had lower net sales in all regions. The decrease in net sales
    was primarily driven by: (i) a 27% decrease in unit
    shipments, (ii) a 9% decrease in average selling price
    (“ASP”), and (iii) decreased revenue from
    intellectual property and technology licensing. The operating
    loss was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, driven by:
    (i) a 9% decrease in ASP, (ii) decreased income from
    intellectual property and technology licensing, (iii) a 27%
    decrease in unit shipments, and (iv) a $277 million charge
    for a legal settlement with Freescale Semiconductor, partially
    offset by savings from supply chain cost-reduction initiatives.
    Our global handset market share for the full year 2007 was
    approximately 14%, a decrease of approximately 8 percentage
    points versus full year 2006.

•

In Our Home and Networks Mobility
    Business:

Net sales were $10.0 billion in 2007,
    an increase of 9% compared to net sales of $9.2 billion in
    2006. Operating earnings were $709 million, a decrease of
    10% compared to operating earnings of $787 million in
    2006. The business had higher net sales in all regions. The
    increase in net sales reflected higher net sales in the home
    business, partially offset by lower net sales of wireless
    networks. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due
    to a decrease in gross margin driven by: (i) lower net
    sales of iDEN infrastructure equipment, and (ii) continued
    competitive pricing pressure in the market for GSM
    infrastructure equipment, partially offset by increased net
    sales of digital entertainment devices.

•

In Our Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    Business:

Net sales were $7.7 billion in
    2007, an increase of 43% compared to net sales of
    $5.4 billion in 2006. Operating earnings were
    $1.2 billion, an increase of 27% compared to operating
    earnings of $958 million in 2006. The increase in net sales
    reflects higher net sales in all regions and was primarily
    driven by sales from the Symbol business acquired in January
    2007, as well as higher net sales in the government and public
    safety market due to strong demand in North America. The
    increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase
    in gross margin in both: (i) the commercial enterprise
    market, driven by net sales from the Symbol business, and
    (ii) the government and public safety market, driven by
    strong net sales in North America, partially offset by:
    (i) an inventory-related charge in connection with the
    acquisition of Symbol, and (ii) increases in SG&A and
    R&D expenses, primarily due to expenses of recently
    acquired businesses.

What were
    our major challenges and accomplishments in 2007?

•

In Our Mobile Devices Business:

The Mobile
    Devices business faced significant challenges in 2007. While
    overall market demand remained strong during the year, demand
    for Motorola’s wireless handsets slowed substantially. As a
    result, Mobile Devices net sales were down 33% compared to 2006
    and the business incurred an operating loss of $1.2 billion.

Unit shipments in 2007 were 159.1 million, a 27% decrease
    compared to unit shipments of 217.4 million in 2006. The
    decrease in unit shipments resulted primarily from gaps in the
    segment’s product portfolio, including limited offerings of
    3G products and products for the Multimedia and Mass Market
    product segments, as well as an aging product portfolio. As a
    result, Motorola believes it lost 8 percentage points of
    market share and estimates its global market share to be
    approximately 14% for the full year 2007.

During 2007, the Mobile Devices business launched 41 new phones,
    including several devices based on its newer open software
    platforms. New devices included: the RAZR2 Feature Phone for
    GSM, CDMA and UMTS technologies; the ROKR Z6 family of music
    devices; the GSM Q8 and UMTS Q9h, for consumers who multi-task
    and want flexibility in today’s business environment; and
    several handsets at affordable price points for consumers with
    everyday communications needs.

Progress was made on key initiatives to implement a

multi-vendor

silicon strategy and utilize improved software platforms. The
    business will use multiple silicon providers to aid in faster
    time to market and reduce costs. As an example, in 2007 the
    Mobile Devices business named Texas Instruments as one of its
    silicon suppliers for future UMTS devices. The business also
    continued its efforts to streamline and improve its software
    platforms, including rationalizing its R&D expenditures on
    legacy platforms and acquiring a 50% stake in UIQ Technology AB
    (“UIQ”). This investment will strengthen UIQ as an
    open application delivery platform for multimedia devices. MOTO
    DEV Studio, which includes multi-platform tools aimed at
    developers, was launched to enhance the ecosystem around its
    Linux wireless platform, MOTOMAGX.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The business implemented improved processes and discipline
    around product pricing, rationalized elements of its
    distribution network, reduced channel inventory and improved its
    cash conversion cycle in the second half of 2007 as compared to
    the first half of 2007.

•

In Our Home and Networks Mobility
    Business:

The Home and Networks Mobility business
    remained the world’s leading provider of digital
    entertainment devices. Motorola shipped over 15 million
    digital entertainment devices during the year, with nearly
    one-third of these shipments being HD/DVR capable. In 2007,
    Motorola shipped over 11 million modems and achieved the
    milestone of shipping its 50 millionth cable/voice modem.
    Sales in the home business grew by 27% in the year, and included
    significant business growth outside of the United States.

The business expanded its core portfolio by completing five
    significant acquisitions, including: (i) Netopia, Inc., a
    broadband equipment provider for DSL customers, which allows for
    phone, TV and fast Internet connections, (ii) Tut Systems, Inc.,
    a leading developer of edge routing and video encoders, (iii)
    Modulus Video, Inc., a provider of MPEG-4 Advanced Coding
    compression systems designed for delivery of high-value video
    content in IP set-top devices for the digital video, broadcast
    and satellite marketplaces, (iv) Terayon Communication Systems,
    Inc., a provider of real-time digital video networking
    applications to cable, satellite and telecommunication service
    providers worldwide, and (v) Leapstone Systems, Inc., a provider
    of intelligent multimedia service delivery and content
    management solutions to networks operators. With these
    acquisitions, Motorola improved its position with global
    operators by enhancing its capabilities in end-to-end video
    solutions.

Motorola also continued its investments in and focus on WiMAX, a
    next-generation wireless broadband technology based on the IEEE
    standard 802.16e. At the end of 2007, the business had won
    several commercial WiMAX contracts and was participating in over
    40 WiMAX trials globally.

The business also had challenges during the year, as the GSM
    infrastructure market faced continuing pricing pressures and
    sales of iDEN infrastructure declined compared to 2006. Despite
    these and other challenges facing the wireless infrastructure
    industry, the wireless networks business remained profitable.
    Finally, the business concluded the sale of its embedded
    communications computing business to Emerson for
    $346 million, reflecting its continuing efforts to focus on
    its core businesses.

In our Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    Business:

In 2007, the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions business delivered solid results in a number of
    markets, largely due to the acquisition of Symbol Technologies,
    Inc. in January 2007, and strong government and public safety
    sales in North America. The business continued to maintain a
    leading market share position in a highly competitive market and
    also showed strong growth outside of the United States.

Within the government and public safety business, sales
    continued to grow worldwide as demand for integrated,
    interoperable public safety communications increased. As new and
    better spectrum utilization evolves, demand and sales have
    increased for high-speed data applications, such as video
    surveillance and other data-based products. In addition to its
    continued success in the United States, our largest market, the
    business was awarded several international contracts for
    significant country-wide system solutions, specifically in
    Europe. The new MOTOTRBO product line was also successfully
    launched and received very positive customer acceptance in all
    geographies.

During the year, the commercial enterprise business enhanced its
    product portfolio by launching several new mobile computing,
    wireless computing and advanced data capture products that put
    it in a strong position in the commercial enterprise marketplace
    for the future. The enhanced mobile computing offerings included
    the MC70 and the rugged MC9090 product lines which had very
    successful product launches and were well received in all
    regions.

Looking
    Forward

The boundaries between the home, work and mobility continue to
    dissolve. We believe our focus on designing and delivering
    differentiated products, unique experiences and powerful
    networks, along with a full compliment of support services, will
    enable consumers to have a broader choice of when, where and how
    they connect to the people, information, and entertainment that
    they want and need. Vast segments of the world’s
    population, many of whom have yet to experience wireless
    communications or connect to the Internet, present new
    opportunities to extend our brand and market our products and
    services.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

With a renewed emphasis on efficiency and time-to-market, we are
    investing in the future of our businesses. Our research and
    development investment priorities include: next-generation
    wireless products, applications, and services for enterprise
    markets; advanced technologies and applications for government
    and public safety markets; and next-generation wireless handsets
    with application services. These investments, together with the
    acquisitions of the past few years, are designed to foster
    continued innovation and profitable growth.

In 2007, our Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions businesses delivered solid results and finished with
    strong momentum. However, our Mobile Devices business faced
    significant challenges in 2007. We remain committed to executing
    on our strategic plans and pursuing opportunities for
    profitability improvement across all of our businesses with
    continued dedication to our customers, quality and innovation.

In our Mobile Devices business, the overall global market
    remains strong and the environment remains intensely
    competitive. Our primary focus is on driving a meaningful
    enhancement of our product portfolio. To this end, we are
    optimizing our use of silicon providers and improving our
    software platforms to ensure that we can deliver the most
    desirable set of experiences to wireless handset consumers. Our
    portfolio enhancement objectives include a broad array of
    cost-effective products at multiple price points in each of our
    four product segments: Mass Market, Feature, Multimedia and
    Productivity. We expect our products to continue to demonstrate
    unique design and innovative features and function around
    experiences including, for example, messaging, music, imaging,
    video, audio and touch. We expect the transition to having more
    devices featuring improved software platforms and silicon
    designs will show progress by the end of this year and continue
    in 2009. In applications and services, we continue to work with
    third parties to develop an ecosystem and service delivery
    platform that will deliver rich experiences to consumers. In
    addition to our efforts to dramatically improve the portfolio,
    we are pursuing cost-reduction initiatives to ensure that we
    have the optimal cost structure for the business going forward.
    We are also evaluating the structural and strategic realignment
    of our business to better equip the Mobile Devices business to
    recapture global market leadership and enhance shareholder value.

In our Home and Networks Mobility business, we are focused on
    delivering personalized media experiences to consumers at home
    and on-the-go and enabling service providers to operate their
    networks more efficiently and profitably. We will leverage our
    market leading position in digital entertainment devices. In
    addition, numerous recent acquisitions have expanded our
    leadership position in broadband products and services for
    video, voice and data. These acquisitions enable us to continue
    capitalizing on strong underlying demand for high definition and

video-on-demand

services, as well as the convergence of services and
    applications across delivery platforms. We will continue to make
    investments to position ourselves as a leading infrastructure
    provider of next-generation wireless technologies. We expect the
    WiMAX market to begin to materialize in 2008 as the first
    networks are commercialized. More significant sales
    opportunities for WiMAX are anticipated beyond 2008. For our
    wireless networks business, we expect the environment to remain
    highly competitive and challenging. By continuing to deliver
    end-to-end solutions that enable delivery of next-generation
    products and services and allocating resources to investment
    priorities, our Home and Networks Mobility segment is poised to
    grow profitably in emerging technologies, including video and
    wireless broadband, and maintain profitability in mature
    technologies.

In our Enterprise Mobility Solutions business, our key objective
    is profitable growth in enterprise markets around the world. We
    will leverage our leadership position in mission-critical
    communications solutions and develop next-generation products
    and solutions for our government and public safety customers
    around the world. Anchored by the 2007 acquisition of Symbol
    Technologies, Inc., we have a very strong presence in the
    commercial enterprise market, including retail, transportation,
    utility, manufacturing, healthcare and other commercial
    customers. Our business-critical products and solutions allow
    our customers to reduce cost, increase worker mobility and
    productivity, and enhance their customers’ experiences. We
    believe that our comprehensive portfolio of enterprise products
    and solutions, leadership positions in government and public
    safety and commercial enterprise markets, global network of
    channel partners, and distributors and solid market growth make
    our Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment well positioned for
    continued success.

Although the Company implemented a number of actions last year
    to reduce cost, including workforce reductions, prioritization
    of investments, spending controls, reduced general and
    administrative expenses and site rationalization, further cost
    savings actions are necessary to improve profitability. The
    Company has determined that additional cost-reduction actions
    will be taken in certain areas, including the Mobile Devices
    business and across various corporate general and administrative
    functions.

The improvement in cash conversion cycle continues to be a major
    focus of the company. Building upon the improvements made during
    2007, we believe we can further reduce the company’s cash
    conversion cycle in 2008, resulting in improved cash flow from
    operations.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We conduct our business in highly competitive markets, facing
    both new and established competitors. The markets for many of
    our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies,
    frequent new product introductions, changing consumer trends,
    short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
    Market disruptions caused by new technologies, the entry of new
    competitors into markets we serve, and frequent consolidations
    among our customers and competitors, among other matters, can
    introduce volatility into our operating performance and cash
    flow from operations. And as we enter 2008, we face a very
    dynamic economic environment. Meeting all of these challenges
    requires consistent operational planning and execution and
    investment in technology, resulting in innovative products that
    meet the expanding needs of our customers around the world. As
    we execute on meeting these objectives, our overall strategy
    remains unchanged — to focus our efforts on the
    convergence of fixed and wireless broadband internet and growing
    demand for next generation wireless communications solutions by
    people, businesses and governments. We will continue to take the
    necessary strategic actions to enable these efforts, to provide
    for growth and improved profitability and position Motorola for
    future success.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results
    of Operations—2007 Compared to 2006

Net
    Sales

Net sales were $36.6 billion in 2007, down 15% compared to
    net sales of $42.8 billion in 2006. The decrease in net
    sales reflects a $9.4 billion decrease in net sales by the
    Mobile Devices segment, partially offset by a $2.3 billion
    increase in net sales by the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment and an $850 million increase in net sales by the
    Home and Networks Mobility segment. The 33% decrease in net
    sales in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by:
    (i) a 27% decrease in unit shipments, (ii) a 9%
    decrease in average selling price (“ASP”), and
    (iii) decreased revenue from intellectual property and
    technology licensing. The 43% increase in net sales in the
    Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment was primarily driven by
    net sales from the Symbol business acquired in January 2007, as
    well as higher net sales in the government and public safety
    market due to strong demand in North America. The 9% increase in
    net sales in the Home and Networks Mobility segment was
    primarily driven by a 51% increase in unit shipments of digital
    entertainment devices, partially offset by lower net sales of
    wireless networks due primarily to lower demand for iDEN and
    CDMA infrastructure equipment.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin was $10.0 billion, or 27.2% of net sales, in
    2007, compared to $12.7 billion, or 29.7% of net sales, in
    2006. The decrease in gross margin reflects decreases in gross
    margin in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility
    segments, partially offset by an increase in gross margin in the
    Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The decrease in gross
    margin in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily due to:
    (i) a 9% decrease in ASP, (ii) decreased income from
    intellectual property and technology licensing, (iii) a 27%
    decrease in unit shipments, and (iv) a $277 million charge
    for a legal settlement with Freescale Semiconductor, partially
    offset by savings from supply chain cost-reduction initiatives.
    The decrease in gross margin in the Home and Networks segment
    was primarily due to: (i) continuing competitive pricing
    pressure in the market for GSM infrastructure equipment, and
    (ii) lower sales of iDEN infrastructure equipment,
    partially offset by increased sales of digital entertainment
    devices. The increase in gross margin in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segment was primarily due to the 43% increase in net
    sales, driven by net sales from the Symbol business acquired in
    January 2007, as well as higher net sales in the government and
    public safety market due to strong demand in North America.

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2007 as
    compared to 2006, reflecting decreases in all three of the
    Company’s business segments. The Company’s overall
    gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be impacted by the
    proportion of overall net sales generated by its various
    businesses.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses increased 13% to $5.1 billion, or 13.9% of net
    sales, in 2007, compared to $4.5 billion, or 10.5% of net
    sales, in 2006. In 2007 compared to 2006, SG&A expenses
    increased in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Home and
    Networks Mobility segments and decreased in the Mobile Devices
    segment. The increases in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and
    Home and Networks Mobility segments were primarily due to
    expenses from recently acquired businesses, partially offset by
    savings from cost-reduction initiatives. The decrease in the
    Mobile Devices segment was primarily due to lower marketing
    expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives, partially
    offset by increased expenditures on information technology
    upgrades. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales
    increased in the Mobile Devices and Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segments and decreased in the Home and Networks
    Mobility segment.

Research
    and Development Expenditures

Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
    increased 8% to $4.4 billion, or 12.1% of net sales, in
    2007, compared to $4.1 billion, or 9.5% of net sales, in
    2006. In 2007 compared to 2006, R&D expenditures increased
    in the Mobile Devices and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segments
    and decreased in the Home and Networks Mobility segment. The
    increase in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily due to
    developmental engineering expenditures for new product
    development and investment in next-generation technologies,
    partially offset by savings from

cost-reduction

initiatives. The increase in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment was primarily due to R&D expenditures incurred by
    recently acquired businesses, partially offset by savings from

cost-reduction

initiatives. The decrease in the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment was primarily due to savings from cost-reduction
    initiatives, partially offset by expenditures by recently
    acquired businesses and continued investment in digital
    entertainment devices and WiMAX. R&D expenditures as a
    percentage of net sales increased



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

in the Mobile Devices segment and decreased in the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments. The
    Company participates in very competitive industries with
    constant changes in technology and, accordingly, the Company
    continues to believe that a strong commitment to R&D is
    required to drive long-term growth.

Other
    Charges (Income)

The Company recorded net charges of $984 million in Other
    charges (income) in 2007, compared to net charges of
    $25 million in 2006. The net charges in 2007 include:
    (i) $369 million of charges relating to the
    amortization of intangibles, (ii) $290 million of net
    reorganization of business charges, (iii) $140 million
    of charges for legal settlements and related insurance matters,
    (iv) $96 million of acquisition-related in-process
    research and development charges (“IPR&D”)
    relating to 2007 acquisitions, and (v) $89 million for
    asset impairment charges. The net charges in 2006 included:
    (i) $172 million of net reorganization of business
    charges, (ii) $100 million of charges relating to the
    amortization of intangibles, (iii) an $88 million
    charitable contribution to the Motorola Foundation of
    appreciated equity holdings in a third party,
    (iv) $50 million of legal reserves, and
    (v) $33 million of acquisition-related IPR&D
    charges relating to 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by
    $418 million of income for payments relating to the Telsim
    collection settlement. The net reorganization of business
    charges are discussed in further detail in the
    “Reorganization of Businesses” section.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $91 million in 2007, compared to
    net interest income of $326 million in 2006. Net interest
    income in 2007 included interest income of $456 million,
    partially offset by interest expense of $365 million. Net
    interest income in 2006 included interest income of
    $661 million, partially offset by interest expense of
    $335 million. The decrease in net interest income was
    primarily attributed to lower interest income due to the
    decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Fund
    balances during 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by
    higher interest rates.

Gains on
    Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
    $50 million in 2007, compared to gains of $41 million
    in 2006. In 2007, the net gain primarily reflects a gain of
    $34 million from the sale of the Company’s embedded
    communications computing business. In 2006, the net gain
    primarily reflected a gain of $141 million on the sale of
    the Company’s remaining shares in Telus Corporation,
    partially offset by a loss of $126 million on the sale of
    the Company’s remaining shares in Sprint Nextel Corporation
    (“Sprint Nextel”).

Other

Income classified as Other, as presented in Other income
    (expense), was $22 million in 2007, compared to net income
    of $151 million in 2006. The net income in 2007 was
    primarily comprised of $97 million of foreign currency
    gains, partially offset by $62 million of investment
    impairment charges. The net income in 2006 was primarily
    comprised of: (i) a $99 million net gain due to an
    increase in market value of a zero-cost collar derivative
    entered into to protect the value of the Company’s
    investment in Sprint Nextel, and (ii) $60 million of
    foreign currency gains, partially offset by $27 million of
    investment impairment charges.

Effective
    Tax Rate

The Company recorded $285 million of net tax benefits in
    2007, compared to $1.3 billion in net tax expense in 2006.
    The Company’s net tax benefit for 2007 was favorably
    impacted by an increase in tax credits compared to 2006. The
    Company’s net tax benefit was also favorably impacted by:
    (i) the settlement of tax positions, (ii) tax incentives
    received, and (iii) reversal of deferred tax valuation
    allowances, and unfavorably impacted by: (i) adjustments to
    deferred taxes in

non-U.S. locations

due to enacted tax rate changes, (ii) an increase in
    unrecognized tax benefits, and (iii) a non-deductible IPR&D
    charge. The Company’s effective tax rate for continuing
    operations, excluding the items described above and the tax
    impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments, was 26%.

The Company’s net tax expense of $1.3 billion in 2006
    was favorably impacted by $348 million of net tax benefits
    relating to: (i) the reduction of valuation allowances, (ii)
    incremental tax benefits related to 2005 cash



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

repatriations, (iii) favorable tax settlements reached with
    foreign jurisdictions, (iv) tax benefits for foreign earnings
    permanently reinvested, (v) contribution of appreciated
    investments to the Company’s charitable foundation and
    unfavorably impacted by: (i) the incurrence of non-deductible
    IPR&D charges, and (ii) restructuring charges in low tax
    jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for 2006 excluding these
    items was 36%.

The effective tax rate for continuing operations excluding
    identified items of 26% for 2007 is less than the comparable
    effective tax rate of 36% for 2006 due to an increase in tax
    credits in 2007 compared to 2006 and a change in the mix of
    income and loss by region. In 2008, the Company currently
    expects the effective tax rate for continuing operations,
    excluding items of the type identified above, to be
    approximately 35%.

Earnings
    (Loss) from Continuing Operations

The Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations
    before income taxes of $390 million in 2007, compared to
    earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of
    $4.6 billion in 2006. After taxes, the Company incurred a
    loss from continuing operations of $105 million, or $0.05
    per diluted share, in 2007, compared to earnings from continuing
    operations of $3.3 billion, or $1.30 per diluted share, in
    2006.

The decrease in earnings (loss) from continuing operations
    before income taxes in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily
    attributed to: (i) a $2.8 billion decrease in gross
    margin, driven by decreases in gross margin in the Mobile
    Devices and Home and Network Mobility segments, partially offset
    by an increase in gross margin in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segment, (ii) a $959 million increase in
    Other charges (income), (iii) a $588 million increase
    in SG&A expenses, (iv) a $323 million increase in
    R&D expenditures, (v) a $235 million decrease in
    net interest income, and (vi) a $129 million decrease
    in income classified as Other, as presented in Other income
    (expense).

Results
    of Operations—2006 Compared to 2005

Net
    Sales

Net sales were $42.8 billion in 2006, up 21% compared to
    net sales of $35.3 billion in 2005. The increase in net
    sales included: (i) a $6.9 billion increase in net
    sales by the Mobile Devices segment driven by a 49% increase in
    unit shipments, reflecting strong demand for GSM and CDMA
    handsets, partially offset by an 11% decline in average selling
    price (“ASP”), (ii) a $362 million increase
    in net sales by the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment,
    primarily due to higher net sales in the government and public
    safety market, and (iii) a $127 million increase in
    net sales by the Home and Networks Mobility segment, primarily
    driven by a 57% increase in unit shipments of digital
    entertainment devices, partially offset by lower net sales of
    wireless networks.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin was $12.7 billion, or 29.7% of net sales, in
    2006, compared to $11.4 billion, or 32.4% of net sales, in
    2005. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the
    Mobile Devices segment, due to: (i) the 49% increase in
    unit shipments, (ii) savings from supply chain
    cost-reduction initiatives, and (iii) increased income from
    intellectual property and technology licensing, partially offset
    by an 11% decline in ASP. The Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment also achieved higher gross margin in 2006 compared to
    2005, primarily driven by a 7% increase in net sales. The Home
    and Networks Mobility Solutions segment had lower gross margin
    in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an unfavorable
    product/regional mix and competitive pricing in the wireless
    networks market, partially offset by higher gross margin in the
    home business.

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2006
    compared to 2005, driven by decreases in the Mobile Devices and
    Home and Networks Mobility segments, partially offset by an
    increase in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The
    Company’s overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales
    can be impacted by the proportion of overall net sales generated
    by its various businesses. The decrease in overall gross margin
    as a percentage of net sales in 2006 compared to 2005 can be
    partially attributed to the fact that an increased percentage of
    the Company’s net sales were generated by the Mobile
    Devices segment in 2006, which generates lower gross margins
    than the overall Company average.

    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses increased 24% to $4.5 billion, or 10.5%
    of net sales, in 2006, compared to $3.6 billion, or 10.3%
    of net sales, in 2005. The increase in SG&A expenses was
    primarily driven by: (i) increased marketing expenses,
    mainly in the Mobile Devices segment, to support higher net
    sales and promote brand awareness, (ii) recognition of
    share-based compensation expense to SG&A-related employees
    in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R, and
    (iii) increased selling and sales support expenses, driven
    by the increase in sales commissions from the increase in net
    sales. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were up
    slightly in 2006 compared to 2005, driven by an increase in the
    Mobile Devices segment, offset by decreases in the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments.

Research
    and Development Expenditures

R&D expenditures increased 14% to $4.1 billion, or
    9.5% of net sales, in 2006, compared to $3.6 billion, or
    10.2% of net sales, in 2005. The increase in R&D
    expenditures was primarily driven by: (i) developmental
    engineering expenditures for new product development and
    investment in next-generation technologies, mainly in the Mobile
    Devices and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segments, and
    (ii) recognition of share-based compensation expense to
    R&D-related employees in connection with the adoption of
    SFAS 123R. R&D expenditures as a percentage of net
    sales decreased in 2006 compared to 2005, driven by decreases in
    the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility segments,
    offset by an increase in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment.

Other
    Charges (Income)

The Company recorded charges of $25 million in Other
    charges (income) in 2006, compared to income of
    $404 million in 2005. The charges in 2006 included:
    (i) $172 million of net reorganization of business
    charges, (ii) $100 million of charges relating to the
    amortization of intangibles, (iii) an $88 million
    charitable contribution to the Motorola Foundation of
    appreciated equity holdings in a third party,
    (iv) $50 million of charges for legal reserves, and
    (v) $33 million of acquisition-related IPR&D
    charges relating to 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by
    $418 million of income for payments relating to the Telsim
    collection settlement. The net income in 2005 primarily
    consisted of $515 million of income for payments relating
    to the Telsim collection settlement, partially offset by:
    (i) $67 million of charges relating to the
    amortization of intangibles, and (ii) $54 million of
    net reorganization of business charges. The net reorganization
    of businesses charges are discussed in further detail in the
    “Reorganization of Businesses” section.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $326 million in 2006, compared to
    net interest income of $71 million in 2005. Net interest
    income in 2006 included interest income of $661 million,
    partially offset by interest expense of $335 million. Net
    interest income in 2005 included interest income of
    $396 million, partially offset by interest expense of
    $325 million. The increase in net interest income was
    primarily attributed to an increase in interest income due to
    higher average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Fund balances
    earning interest at higher rates.

Gains on
    Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
    $41 million in 2006, compared to $1.8 billion in 2005.
    In 2006, the $41 million of net gains primarily reflected a
    gain of $141 million on the sale of the Company’s
    remaining shares in Telus Corporation, partially offset by a
    loss of $126 million on the sale of the Company’s
    remaining shares in Sprint Nextel Corporation (“Sprint
    Nextel”). In 2005, the net gains were primarily related to:
    (i) a $1.3 billion net gain recognized in connection
    with the completion of the merger between Sprint Corporation
    (“Sprint”) and Nextel Communications, Inc.
    (“Nextel”), and (ii) a $609 million net gain
    on the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares of Nextel,
    partially offset by a $70 million net loss on the sale of a
    portion of the Company’s shares of Sprint Nextel.

Other

Income classified as Other, as presented in Other income
    (expense), was $151 million in 2006, compared to net
    charges of $109 million in 2005. The net income in 2006 was
    primarily comprised of: (i) a $99 million net gain due
    to an increase in market value of a zero-cost collar derivative
    entered into to protect the value of the



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Company’s investment in Sprint Nextel, and
    (ii) $60 million of foreign currency gains, partially
    offset by $27 million of investment impairment charges. In
    2005, the net charges were primarily comprised of:
    (i) $137 million of debt retirement costs, relating to
    the Company’s repurchase of an aggregate principal amount
    of $1.0 billion of long-term debt through cash tender
    offers, (ii) $38 million of foreign currency losses,
    and (iii) $25 million in investment impairment
    charges, partially offset by: (i) a $51 million gain
    due to an increase in the market value of variable forward
    instruments entered into to protect the value of the
    Company’s investment in Nextel common stock prior to the
    merger of Sprint and Nextel, and (ii) $30 million in
    income from the repayment of a previously-reserved loan related
    to Iridium.

Effective
    Tax Rate

The Company recorded $1.3 billion of net tax expense in
    2006, compared to $1.9 billion of net tax expense in 2005.
    During 2006, the Company recorded $348 million of net
    tax benefits relating to: (i) the reduction of valuation
    allowances, (ii) incremental tax benefits related to 2005 cash
    repatriations, (iii) favorable tax settlements reached with
    foreign jurisdictions, (iv) tax benefits for foreign earnings
    permanently reinvested, (v) contribution of appreciated
    investments to the Company’s charitable foundation and
    unfavorably impacted by: (i) the incurrence of non-deductible
    IPR&D charges, and (ii) restructuring charges in low tax
    jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for 2006 excluding these
    items was 36%.

During 2005, the tax rate reflected a $265 million net tax
    benefit related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under
    the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and an
    $81 million net tax benefit on the stock sale of a sensor
    business that was divested in 2005.

Earnings
    from Continuing Operations

The Company had earnings from continuing operations before
    income taxes of $4.6 billion in 2006, compared to earnings
    from continuing operations before income taxes of
    $6.4 billion in 2005. After taxes, the Company had earnings
    from continuing operations of $3.3 billion, or $1.30 per
    diluted share, in 2006, compared with earnings from continuing
    operations of $4.5 billion, or $1.79 per diluted share, in
    2005.

The decrease in earnings from continuing operations before
    income taxes in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributed
    to: (i) a $1.8 billion decrease in gains on the sale
    of investments and businesses, (ii) an $876 million
    increase in SG&A expenses, (iii) a $506 million
    increase in R&D expenditures, and (iv) a
    $429 million change in Other charges (income). These
    negative impacts on operating earnings were partially offset by:
    (i) a $1.3 billion increase in gross margin, primarily
    due to the $7.5 billion increase in net sales, (ii) a
    $260 million increase in income classified as Other, as
    presented in Other income (expense), and (iii) a
    $255 million increase in net interest income.

Reorganization
    of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
    “Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
    eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
    and employment grade level in the event that employment is
    involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in-force

or restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in-force

has qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan.
    The Company recognizes termination benefits based on formulas
    per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future
    settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on
    estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved
    by management. Exit costs primarily consist of future minimum
    lease payments on vacated facilities. At each reporting date,
    the Company evaluates its accruals for exit costs and employee
    separation costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate.
    In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer required
    because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because
    employees previously identified for separation resigned from the
    Company and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to
    circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
    initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the income
    statement line item where the original charges were recorded
    when it is determined they are no longer required.

The Company realized cost-saving benefits of approximately $165
    million in 2007 from the plans that were initiated during 2007,
    representing: (i) $93 million of savings in R&D
    expenditures, (ii) $46 million of savings in SG&A
    expenses, and (iii) $26 million of savings in Costs of
    sales. Beyond 2007, the Company expects the reorganization plans
    initiated during 2007 to provide annualized cost savings of
    approximately $548 million,



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

representing: (i) $251 million of savings in R&D
    expenditures, (ii) $167 million of savings in SG&A
    expenses, and (iii) $130 million of savings in Cost of
    sales.

    Charges

During 2007, the Company committed to implement various
    productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term,
    sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing
    operating costs. All three of the Company’s business
    segments, as well as corporate functions, are impacted by these
    plans. The majority of the employees affected are located in
    North America and Europe. The Company recorded net
    reorganization of business charges of $394 million,
    including $104 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $290 million of charges under Other charges (income) in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Included
    in the aggregate $394 million are charges of
    $401 million for employee separation costs,
    $42 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
    $19 million for exit costs, offset by reversals for
    accruals no longer needed.

Exit
    Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $54 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2007 additional charges of $19 million
    are primarily related to the exit of certain activities and
    leased facilities in Ireland by the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment. The 2007 adjustments of $2 million represent
    accruals for exit costs established through purchase accounting
    for businesses acquired. The $33 million used in 2007
    reflects cash payments. The remaining accrual of
    $42 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007, represents future cash payments for
    lease termination obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $104 million for employee separation costs, representing
    the severance costs for approximately 2,300 employees. The
    2007 additional charges of $401 million represent severance
    costs for approximately 6,700 employees, of which 2,400 were
    direct employees and 4,300 were indirect employees.

The adjustments of $64 million reflect $68 million of
    reversals of accruals no longer needed, partially offset by
    $4 million of accruals for severance plans established
    through purchase accounting for businesses acquired. The
    $68 million of reversals represent previously accrued costs
    for 1,100 employees, and primarily relates to a strategic

change regarding a plant closure and specific employees
    previously identified for separation who resigned from the
    Company and did not receive severance or who were redeployed due
    to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
    approved. The $4 million of accruals represents severance
    plans for approximately 200 employees established through
    purchase accounting for businesses acquired.

During 2007, approximately 5,300 employees, of which 1,700 were
    direct employees and 3,600 were indirect employees, were
    separated from the Company. The $248 million used in 2007
    reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
    remaining accrual of $193 million, which is included in
    Accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets at December 31, 2007, is expected to be paid to
    approximately 2,800 employees to be separated in 2008.

    Charges

During 2006, the Company committed to implement various
    productivity improvement plans aimed principally at:
    (i) reducing costs in its supply-chain activities,
    (ii) integration synergies, and (iii) reducing other
    operating expenses, primarily relating to engineering and
    development costs. The Company recorded net reorganization of
    business charges of $213 million, including
    $41 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $172 million of charges under Other charges in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Included in
    the aggregate $213 million are charges of $191 million
    for employee separation costs, $15 million for fixed asset
    impairment charges and $30 million for exit costs,
    partially offset by $23 million of reversals for accruals
    no longer needed. Total employees impacted by the actions
    committed to in 2006 were 3,900.

Exit
    Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $50 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2006 additional charges of $30 million
    were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segment. The 2006 adjustments of
    $7 million represent reversals of accruals no longer
    needed. The $19 million used in 2006 reflects cash payments
    to lessors. The remaining accrual of $54 million, which is
    included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006,
    represented future cash payments for lease termination
    obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $53 million for employee separation costs, representing the
    severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees, of which
    1,100 were direct employees and 500 were indirect employees. The
    2006 additional charges of $191 million represented costs
    for an additional



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND

3,900 employees, of which 1,700 were direct employees and
    2,200 were indirect employees. The adjustments of
    $16 million represented reversals of accruals no longer
    needed.

During 2006, approximately 3,200 employees, of which 1,400
    were direct employees and 1,800 were indirect employees, were
    separated from the Company. The $124 million used in 2006
    reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
    remaining accrual of $104 million, was included in Accrued
    liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2006.

    Charges

During 2005, the Company recorded net reorganization of business
    charges of $91 million, including $37 million of
    charges in Costs of sales and $54 million of charges under
    Other charges in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. Included in the aggregate $91 million are
    charges of $86 million for employee separation costs and
    $15 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
    $5 million for exit costs, partially offset by
    $15 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.
    Total employees impacted by these action were approximately
    2,600.

Exit
    Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
    $73 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2005 additional charges of $5 million
    were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segment. The 2005 adjustments of
    $7 million represented reversals of $1 million for
    accruals no longer needed and $6 million of translation
    adjustments. The $21 million used in 2005 reflected cash
    payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of $50 million,
    which was included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005,
    represented future cash payments for lease termination
    obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
    $41 million for employee separation costs, representing the
    severance costs for approximately 400 employees, of which
    50 were direct employees and 350 were indirect employees. The
    2005 additional charges of $86 million represented the
    severance costs for approximately 2,600 employees, of which
    1,300 were direct employees and 1,300 were indirect employees.
    The adjustments of $14 million represented reversals of
    accruals no longer needed.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

During 2005, approximately 1,400 employees, of which 300
    were direct employees and 1,100 were indirect employees, were
    separated from the Company. The $60 million used in 2005
    reflected cash payments to these separated employees. The
    remaining accrual of $53 million was included in Accrued
    liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2005.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
    Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are
    impacted by four key components: (i) current cash and cash
    equivalents, (ii) operating activities,
    (iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing
    activities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

During 2007, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents (which
    are highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less) decreased by $64 million to
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006. At
    December 31, 2007, $230 million of this amount was
    held in the U.S. and $2.5 billion was held by the
    Company or its subsidiaries in other countries. Repatriation of
    some of these funds could be subject to delay and could have
    potential adverse tax consequences. At December 31, 2007,
    restricted cash was $158 million, compared to
    $131 million of December 31, 2006.

The Company has approximately $2.7 billion of earnings in
    foreign subsidiaries that are not permanently reinvested and may
    be repatriated without additional U.S. federal income tax
    charges to the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations, given the U.S. federal tax provisions accrued
    on undistributed earnings and the utilization of available
    foreign tax credits. On a cash basis, these repatriations from
    the Company’s

non-U.S. subsidiaries

could require the payment of additional foreign taxes, which
    would be creditable against U.S. federal income taxes. The
    repatriation of some of these funds could also be subject to
    delay for local country approvals.

Operating
    Activities

The Company has generated positive cash flow from continuing
    operations in each of the last seven years. The cash provided by
    operating activities from continuing operations in 2007 was
    $785 million, compared to $3.5 billion in 2006, and
    $4.3 billion in 2005. The primary contributors to cash flow
    from operations in 2007 were: (i) a $2.5 billion
    decrease in accounts receivable, (ii) a $556 million
    decrease in inventories, (iii) earnings from continuing
    operations (adjusted for non-cash items) of $529 million,
    and (iv) a $170 million cash inflow due to changes in
    other assets and liabilities. These positive contributors to
    operating cash flow were partially offset by: (i) a
    $2.3 billion decrease in accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities, and (ii) a $705 million increase in other
    current assets.

Accounts Receivable:

The Company’s net
    accounts receivable were $5.3 billion at December 31,
    2007, compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2006.
    The Company’s days sales outstanding (“DSO”),
    including net long-term receivables, were 50 days at
    December 31, 2007, compared to 58 days at
    December 31, 2006. The Company’s businesses sell their
    products in a variety of markets throughout the world and
    payment terms can vary by market type and geographic location.
    Accordingly, the Company’s levels of net accounts
    receivable and DSO can be impacted by the timing and level of
    sales that are made by its various businesses and by the
    geographic locations in which those sales are made. In addition,
    from time to time, the Company elects to sell accounts
    receivable to third parties. The Company’s levels of net
    accounts receivable and DSO can be impacted by the timing and
    amount of such sales, which can vary by period and can be
    impacted by numerous factors.

Inventory:

The Company’s net inventory
    was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to
    $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006. The Company’s
    inventory turns decreased to 10.0 at December 31, 2007,
    compared to 11.0 at December 31, 2006, primarily due to
    lower than expected sales volumes in the Mobile Devices
    business. Inventory turns were calculated using an annualized
    rolling three months of cost of sales method. The Company’s
    days sales in inventory (“DSI”) was 36 days at
    December 31, 2007, compared to 32 days at
    December 31, 2006. DSI is calculated by dividing net
    inventory by the average daily cost of sales. Inventory
    management continues to be an area of focus as the Company
    balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to
    ensure competitive delivery performance to its customers against
    the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing
    technology and customer spending requirements.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Accounts Payable:

The Company’s net
    accounts payable were $4.2 billion at December 31, 2007,
    compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2006. The
    Company’s days payable outstanding (“DPO”) were
    53 days at December 31, 2007, compared to 52 days
    at December 31, 2006. DPO is calculated by dividing
    accounts payable by the average daily cost of sales. The Company
    buys products in a variety of markets throughout the world and
    payment terms can vary by market type and geographic location.
    Accordingly, the Company’s levels of accounts payable and
    DPO can be impacted by the timing and level of purchases made by
    its various businesses and by the geographic locations in which
    those purchases are made.

Cash Conversion Cycle:

The Company’s cash
    conversion cycle (“CCC”) was 33 days at
    December 31, 2007, compared to 38 days at
    December 31, 2006. CCC is calculated by adding DSO and DSI
    and subtracting DPO. The decrease in CCC at December 31,
    2007, compared to December 31, 2006, was driven by lower
    CCC in the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segments.

Reorganization of Businesses:

The Company has
    implemented reorganization of businesses plans. Cash payments
    for exit costs and employee separations in connection with a
    number of these plans were $281 million in 2007, as
    compared to $143 million in 2006. Of the $235 million
    reorganization of businesses accrual at December 31, 2007,
    $193 million relates to employee separation costs and is
    expected to be paid in 2008. The remaining $42 million in
    accruals relate to lease termination obligations that are
    expected to be paid over a number of years.

Defined Benefit Plan Contributions:

The
    Company contributed $274 million to its U.S. pension
    plans during 2007, compared to $276 million contributed in
    2006. The Company contributed $135 million to its

non-U.S. pension

plans during 2007, compared to $122 million contributed in
    2006. During 2008, the Company expects to make cash
    contributions of approximately $240 million to its
    U.S. pension plans and approximately $50 million to
    its

non-U.S. pension

plans. The Company contributed $15 million to its retiree
    health care plan in 2007, compared to $27 million in 2006,
    and expects to contribute approximately $20 million to this
    plan in 2008. Retirement-related benefits are further discussed
    below in the “Significant Accounting
    Policies—Retirement-Related Benefits” section.

Investing
    Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s investing
    activities include: (i) proceeds from sales of Sigma Fund
    investments, (ii) strategic acquisitions of, or investments
    in, other companies, (iii) capital expenditures, and
    (iv) proceeds from sales of investments and businesses.

Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing
    operations was $2.4 billion in 2007, compared to net cash
    used of $1.4 billion in 2006 and net cash used of
    $2.4 billion in 2005. This $3.8 billion increase in
    cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations
    was due to: (i) an $8.2 billion increase in proceeds
    from sales of Sigma Fund investments, (ii) a
    $484 million increase in proceeds from sales of short-term
    investments, (iii) a $122 million decrease in capital
    expenditures, and (iv) an $81 million increase in
    proceeds received from the disposition of property, plant and
    equipment, partially offset by: (i) a $3.5 billion
    increase in cash used for acquisitions and investments, and
    (ii) a $1.6 billion decrease in proceeds from sales of
    investments and businesses. The $2.4 billion in cash used
    for investing activities from continuing operations in 2005 was
    primarily due to the $3.2 billion of net cash used for
    purchase of Sigma Fund investments, partially offset by $1.5
    billion in proceeds from sale of investments and businesses.

Sigma Fund:

The Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries invest most of their excess cash in a fund (the
    “Sigma Fund”) that is similar to a money market fund.
    During 2007, the Company liquidated a similar second fund and
    now maintains only one fund. The Company received
    $6.9 billion in net proceeds from sales of Sigma Fund
    investments in 2007, compared to $1.3 billion in net cash
    used to purchase Sigma Fund investments in 2006. The Sigma Fund
    aggregate balances were $5.2 billion at December 31,
    2007, compared to $12.2 billion at December 31, 2006.
    At December 31, 2007, $1.7 billion of the Sigma Fund
    investments were held in the U.S. and $3.5 billion
    were held by the Company or its subsidiaries in other countries.
    Repatriation of some of these funds could be subject to delay
    and could have potential adverse tax consequences.

The Sigma Fund portfolio is managed by four major independent
    investment management firms. Investments are made in
    high-quality, investment grade (rated at least

A/A-1

by
    S&P or

A2/P-1

by
    Moody’s at purchase date), U.S. dollar-denominated
    debt obligations including certificates of deposit, commercial
    paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and

asset-

and

mortgage-backed

securities. The Sigma Fund’s investment policies require
    that floating rate instruments must have a maturity, at purchase
    date, that does not exceed thirty-six months with an



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

interest rate reset at least annually. The average reset
    maturity of the investments held by the funds must be
    120 days or less with the actual average reset maturity of
    the investments being 40 days and 53 days at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

During 2007, the Company recorded a $75 million reduction
    in the available-for-sale securities held in the Sigma Fund,
    reflecting a decline in the fair value of the securities. As of
    December 31, 2007, $57 million of this reduction
    represents a broad-based temporary decline in market value of
    various securities primarily due to credit spreads widening in
    several debt market segments, with the offsetting reduction
    reflected in Non-owners changes to equity. The Company believes
    credit market spreads will return to normal levels in the
    future. Additionally, due to the high credit ratings of the
    underlying securities, it is probable that the Company will be
    able to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms
    of the corporate bonds where fair values are less than their
    cost as of December 31, 2007. It is for these reasons that the
    unrealized losses on these corporate bonds are considered
    temporary. If it becomes probable that the Company will not
    collect all amounts in accordance with the contractual terms of
    a corporate bond, the Company considers the decline
    other-than-temporary. The remaining $18 million reduction
    in available-for-sale securities held by the Sigma Fund
    represents an other-than-temporary decline and has been
    reflected as an investment impairment.

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:

The
    Company used net cash for acquisitions and new investment
    activities of $4.6 billion in 2007, compared to net cash
    used of $1.1 billion in 2006 and net cash used of
    $312 million in 2005. The largest components of the
    $4.6 billion in 2007 expenditures were:
    (i) $3.5 billion for the acquisition of Symbol
    Technologies, Inc. (part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment), (ii) $438 million for the acquisition of
    Good Technology, Inc. (part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment), (iii) $183 million for Netopia, Inc. (part
    of the Home and Networks Mobility segment),
    (iv) $137 million for Terayon Communications Systems
    (part of the Home and Networks Mobility segment), (v) the
    acquisition of Tut Systems, Inc. (part of the Home and Networks
    Mobility segment), (vi) the acquisition of Modulus Video,
    Inc. (part of the Home and Networks Mobility segment), and
    (vii) the acquisition of Leapstone Systems, Inc. (part of
    the Home and Networks Mobility segment). The largest components
    of the $1.1 billion in 2006 expenditures were:
    (i) $300 million for an equity investment in
    Clearwire, Inc., (ii) $193 million for the acquisition
    of TTP Communications plc (part of the Mobile Devices segment),
    (iii) $181 million for the acquisition of Broadbus
    Technologies, Inc. (part of the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment), (iv) $108 million for the acquisition of
    Kreatel Communications AB (part of the Home and Networks
    Mobility segment), (v) the acquisition of Orthogon Systems
    (part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment), and
    (vi) the acquisition of NextNet Wireless, Inc. (part of the
    Home and Networks Mobility segment).

Capital Expenditures:

Capital expenditures
    were $527 million in 2007, compared to $649 million in
    2006 and $548 million in 2005. The Company’s emphasis
    in making capital expenditures is to focus on strategic
    investments driven by customer demand and new design capability.

Sales of Investments and Businesses:

The
    Company received $411 million in proceeds from the sales of
    investments and businesses in 2007, compared to proceeds of
    $2.0 billion in 2006 and $1.5 billion in 2005. The
    $411 million in proceeds in 2007 were primarily comprised
    of $346 million from the sale of the Company’s
    embedded communications computing business. The
    $2.0 billion in proceeds in 2006 were primarily comprised
    of: (i) $856 million in net proceeds from the sale of
    the automotive electronics business, (ii) $820 million
    from the sale of the Company’s remaining shares in Sprint
    Nextel Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) and the
    termination and cash settlement of a zero-cost collar derivative
    relating to these Sprint Nextel shares, and
    (iii) $175 million from the sale of the Company’s
    remaining shares in Telus Corporation.

Short-Term Investments:

At December 31,
    2007, the Company had $612 million in short-term
    investments (which are highly-liquid fixed-income investments
    with an original maturity greater than three months but less
    than one year), compared to $620 million of short-term
    investments at December 31, 2006.

Investment Securities:

In addition to
    available cash and cash equivalents, Sigma Fund balances and
    short-term investments, the Company views its investment
    securities as an additional source of liquidity. The majority of
    these securities represent investments in technology companies
    and, accordingly, the fair market values of these securities are
    subject to substantial price volatility. In addition, the
    realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
    other conditions. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s
    available-for-sale securities portfolio had an approximate fair
    market value of $333 million, which represented a cost
    basis of $372 million and a net unrealized loss of
    $39 million. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s
    available-for-sale securities portfolio had an approximate fair
    market value of $130 million, which represented a cost basis of
    $70 million and a net unrealized gain of $60 million.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financing
    Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s financing
    activities are: (i) the purchase of the Company’s
    common stock under its share repurchase program, (ii) the
    net proceeds from issuance of debt, (iii) repayment of
    debt, (iv) the payment of dividends, (v) proceeds from
    the issuances of stock due to the exercise of employee stock
    options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan,
    (vi) repayment of commercial paper and short-term
    borrowings, (vii) distributions to discontinued operations,
    and (viii) excess tax benefits from share-based
    compensation.

Net cash used for financing activities from continuing
    operations was $3.3 billion in 2007, compared to
    $3.2 billion of cash used in 2006 and $907 million of
    cash used in 2005. Cash used for financing activities from
    continuing operations in 2007 was primarily:
    (i) $3.0 billion of cash used to purchase
    171.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock
    under the share repurchase program, (ii) $1.4 billion of
    cash used for the repayment of maturing debt,
    (iii) $468 million of cash used to pay dividends,
    (iv) $242 million of net cash used for the repayment
    of commercial paper and short-term borrowings, and
    (v) $75 million in distributions to discontinued
    operations, partially offset by proceeds of:
    (i) $1.4 billion received from the issuance of

long-term

debt, (ii) $440 million received from the issuance of
    common stock in connection with the Company’s employee
    stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan, and
    (iii) $50 million in excess tax benefits from
    share-based compensation.

Cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in
    2006 was primarily: (i) $3.8 billion of cash used to
    purchase 171.7 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock under the share repurchase program,
    (ii) $443 million of cash used to pay dividends,
    (iii) $23 million in distributions to discontinued
    operations, and (iv) $18 million of cash used for the
    repayment of debt, partially offset by proceeds of:
    (i) $918 million received from the issuance of common
    stock in connection with the Company’s employee stock
    option plans and employee stock purchase plan,
    (ii) $165 million in excess tax benefits from
    share-based compensation, and (iii) $66 million in net
    proceeds from commercial paper and short-term borrowings.

Commercial Paper and Other Short-Term Debt:

At
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s outstanding notes
    payable and current portion of long-term debt was
    $332 million, compared to $1.7 billion at
    December 31, 2006. In January 2007, the Company repaid, at
    maturity, the entire $118 million aggregate principal
    amount outstanding of its 7.6% Notes due January 1,
    2007. In November 2007, the Company repaid, at maturity, the
    entire $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding
    of its 4.608% Senior Notes due November 16, 2007.
    During 2007, $114 million of 6.50% Senior Notes due
    March 1, 2008 and $84 million of 5.80% Senior
    Notes due October 15, 2008 were reclassified to current
    portion of long-term debt.

Net cash used for the repayment of commercial paper and
    short-term borrowings was $242 million in 2007, compared to
    $66 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of
    commercial paper and short-term borrowings in 2006. The Company
    had no commercial paper outstanding on December 31, 2007,
    compared to $300 million of outstanding commercial paper on
    December 31, 2006. The Company continues to have access to
    the commercial paper markets. For the past four years, the
    Company has generally maintained commercial paper balances
    between $300 million and $400 million. However, as a
    result of conditions in the credit markets, the interest rates
    the Company would have to pay to issue commercial paper
    increased during the third and fourth quarters of 2007.
    Accordingly, the Company elected to eliminate its commercial
    paper outstanding until pricing becomes more favorable. The
    Company will issue commercial paper when it believes it is
    prudent to do so in light of prevailing market conditions and
    other factors.

Long-term Debt:

At December 31, 2007, the
    Company had outstanding long-term debt of $4.0 billion,
    compared to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006. The
    Company continues to have access to the long-term debt markets.

In November 2007, the Company issued an aggregate face principal
    amount of: (i) $400 million of 5.375% Senior
    Notes due November 15, 2012, (ii) $400 million of
    6.00% Senior Notes due November 15, 2017, and
    (iii) $600 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due
    November 15, 2037.

The Company may from time to time seek to opportunistically
    retire certain of its outstanding debt through open market cash
    purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such
    repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market
    conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements,
    contractual restrictions and other factors.

Share Repurchase Program:

During 2007,
    the Company repurchased 171.2 million of its common shares
    at an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion, or an average cost of
    $17.74 per share. In 2006, the Company repurchased a



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

total of 171.7 million of its common shares at an aggregate cost
    of $3.8 billion, or an average cost of $22.29 per share. In
    2005, the Company repurchased a total of 41.7 million shares at
    an aggregate cost of $874 million, or an average cost of
    $20.96 per share. Since the inception of its first-ever share
    repurchase program in May 2005, the Company has repurchased a
    total of 384.6 million of its common shares for an aggregate
    cost of $7.7 billion. All repurchased shares have been retired.

Through actions taken in July 2006 and March 2007, the Board of
    Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an aggregate
    amount of up to $7.5 billion of its outstanding shares of
    common stock over a period ending in June 2009, subject to
    market conditions (the “2006 Stock Repurchase
    Program”). As of December 31, 2007, the Company
    remained authorized to purchase an aggregate amount of up to
    $3.8 billion of additional shares under the 2006 Stock
    Repurchase Program.

Credit Ratings:

Three independent credit
    rating agencies, Fitch Investors Service (“Fitch”),
    Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”), and
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), assign
    ratings to the Company’s short-term and long-term debt. The
    following chart reflects the current ratings assigned to the
    Company’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term
    debt and the Company’s commercial paper by each of these
    agencies.

The Company’s debt ratings are considered “investment
    grade.” If the Company’s senior long-term debt were
    rated lower than “BBB-” by S&P or Fitch or
    “Baa3” by Moody’s (which would be a decline of
    two levels from current Fitch and S&P ratings), the
    Company’s long-term debt would no longer be considered
    “investment grade.” If this were to occur, the terms
    on which the Company could borrow money would become more
    onerous. The Company would also have to pay higher fees related
    to its domestic revolving credit facility. The Company has never
    borrowed under its domestic revolving credit facilities.

As further described under “Customer Financing
    Arrangements” below, for many years the Company has
    utilized a number of receivables programs to sell a
    broadly-diversified group of short-term receivables to third
    parties. Certain of the short-term receivables are sold to a
    multi-seller commercial paper conduit. This program provides for
    up to $400 million of short-term receivables to be
    outstanding with the conduit at any time. The obligations of the
    conduit to continue to purchase receivables under this
    short-term receivables program could be terminated if the
    Company’s long-term debt was rated lower than
    “BB+” by S&P or “Ba1” by Moody’s
    (which would be a decline of three levels from the current
    S&P rating). If this short-term receivables program were
    terminated, the Company would no longer be able to sell its
    short-term receivables to the conduit in this manner, but it
    would not have to repurchase previously-sold receivables.

Credit
    Facilities

At December 31, 2007, the Company’s total domestic and

non-U.S. credit

facilities totaled $4.3 billion, of which $314 million
    was considered utilized. These facilities are principally
    comprised of: (i) a $2.0 billion five-year revolving
    domestic credit facility maturing in December 2011 (the

“5-Year

Credit Facility”) which is not utilized, and
    (ii) $2.3 billion of uncommitted

non-U.S. credit

facilities (of which $314 million was considered utilized
    at December 31, 2007). Unused availability under the
    existing credit facilities, together with available cash, cash
    equivalents, Sigma Fund balances and other sources of liquidity,
    are generally available to support outstanding commercial paper,
    of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2007.

In order to borrow funds under the

5-Year

Credit Facility, the Company must be in compliance with various
    conditions, covenants and representations contained in the
    agreements. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the

5-Year

Credit Facility at December 31, 2007. The Company has never
    borrowed under its domestic

revolving credit facilities. Utilization of the

non-U.S. credit

facilities may also be dependent on the Company’s ability
    to meet certain conditions at the time a borrowing is requested.

Amounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments.

Debt Obligations:

At December 31, 2007,
    the Company’s long-term debt obligations, including current
    maturities and unamortized discount and issue costs, totaled
    $4.2 billion, as compared to $4.1 billion at
    December 31, 2006. A table of all outstanding long-term
    debt securities can be found in Note 4, “Debt and
    Credit Facilities,” to the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Purchase Obligations:

The Company has entered
    into agreements for the purchase of inventory, license of
    software, promotional activities, and research and development,
    which are firm commitments and are not cancelable. The longest
    of these agreements extends through 2015. Total payments
    expected to be made under these agreements total
    $2.2 billion.

The Company enters into a number of arrangements for the
    sourcing of supplies and materials with take-or-pay obligations.
    The Company’s obligations with these suppliers run through
    2011 and total a minimum purchase obligation of
    $1.2 billion during that period. The $1.2 billion
    reflects an amended agreement that was completed subsequent to
    December 31, 2007 with one supplier that reduced the
    Company’s minimum purchase obligation by approximately
    $200 million. Subsequent to the end of 2007, the Company
    entered into new take-or-pay arrangements with suppliers that
    extend through 2009 with minimum purchase obligations of
    $63 million. The Company does not anticipate the
    cancellation of any of these agreements in the future and
    estimates that purchases from these suppliers will exceed the
    minimum obligations during the agreement periods.

Lease Obligations:

The Company owns most of
    its major facilities, but does lease certain office, factory and
    warehouse space, land, and information technology and other
    equipment under principally non-cancelable operating leases. At
    December 31, 2007, future minimum lease obligations, net of
    minimum sublease rentals, totaled $1.4 billion. Rental
    expense, net of sublease income, was $231 million in 2007,
    $241 million in 2006 and $250 million in 2005.

Tax Obligations:

The Company has approximately
    $1.4 billion of unrecognized income tax benefits relating
    to multiple tax jurisdictions and tax years. A significant
    portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, if settled, would not
    result in current or future payments as tax carry forwards are
    available for utilization. The Company anticipates that it is
    reasonably possible that $40 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits could be settled in 2008. However, it is not
    possible to estimate the timing of any other potential
    settlements.

Commitments Under Other Long-Term
    Agreements:

The Company has entered into certain
    long-term agreements to purchase software, components, supplies
    and materials from suppliers. Most of the agreements extend for
    periods of one to three years (three to five years for
    software). However, generally these agreements do not obligate
    the Company to make any purchases, and many permit the Company
    to terminate the agreement with advance notice (usually ranging
    from 60 to 180 days). If the Company were to terminate
    these agreements, it generally would be liable for certain
    termination charges, typically based on work performed and
    supplier on-hand inventory and raw materials attributable to
    canceled orders. The Company’s liability would only arise
    in the event it terminates the agreements for reasons other than
    “cause.”



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company outsources certain corporate functions, such as
    benefit administration and information technology-related
    services. These contracts are expected to expire in 2013. The
    total remaining payments under these contracts are approximately
    $1.1 billion over the remaining 6 years; however,
    these contracts can be terminated. Termination would result in a
    penalty substantially less than the remaining annual contract
    payments. The Company would also be required to find another
    source for these services, including the possibility of
    performing them in-house.

As is customary in bidding for and completing network
    infrastructure projects and pursuant to a practice the Company
    has followed for many years, the Company has a number of
    performance/bid bonds and standby letters of credit outstanding,
    primarily relating to projects of the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments. These
    instruments normally have maturities of up to three years and
    are standard in the industry as a way to give customers a
    convenient mechanism to seek resolution if a contractor does not
    satisfy performance requirements under a contract. A customer
    can draw on the instrument only if the Company does not fulfill
    all terms of a project contract. If such an occasion occurred,
    the Company would be obligated to reimburse the financial
    institution that issued the bond or letter of credit for the
    amounts paid. The Company is not generally required to post any
    cash in connection with the issuance of these bonds or letters
    of credit. In its long history, it has been extraordinarily
    uncommon for the Company to have a performance/bid bond or
    standby letter of credit drawn upon. At December 31, 2007,
    outstanding performance/bid bonds and standby letters of credit
    totaled approximately $1.7 billion, compared to
    $1.5 billion at the end of 2006.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

Under the
    definition contained in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of

Regulation S-K,

the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Customer
    Financing Commitments and Guarantees

Outstanding Commitments:

Certain purchasers of
    the Company’s infrastructure equipment continue to request
    that suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment
    purchases. These requests may include all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the equipment. Periodically, the Company makes
    commitments to provide financing to purchasers in connection
    with the sale of equipment. However, the Company’s
    obligation to provide financing is often conditioned on the
    issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a
    reputable bank to support the purchaser’s credit or a
    pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the
    receivable from the Company. The Company had outstanding
    commitments to extend long-term credit to third parties totaling
    $610 million at December 31, 2007, compared to
    $398 million at December 31, 2006. Of these amounts,
    $454 million was supported by letters of credit or by bank
    commitments to purchase receivables at December 31, 2007,
    compared to $262 million at December 31, 2006.

Guarantees of Third-Party Debt:

In addition to
    providing direct financing to certain equipment customers, the
    Company also assists customers in obtaining financing directly
    from banks and other sources to fund equipment purchases. The
    Company had committed to provide financial guarantees relating
    to customer financing totaling $42 million and
    $122 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively (including $23 million
    and $19 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables).
    Customer financing guarantees outstanding were $3 million
    and $47 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively (including $0 million and $2 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to the
    sale of short-term receivables).

Customer
    Financing Arrangements

Outstanding Finance Receivables:

The Company
    had net finance receivables of $118 million at
    December 31, 2007, compared to $269 million at
    December 31, 2006 (net of allowances for losses of
    $5 million at December 31, 2007 and $10 million
    at December 31, 2006). These finance receivables are
    generally interest bearing, with rates ranging from 3% to 14%.
    Interest income recognized on finance receivables for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $7 million,
    $9 million and $7 million, respectively.

Sales of Receivables and Loans:

From time to
    time, the Company sells short-term receivables, long-term loans
    and lease receivables under sales-type leases (collectively,
    “finance receivables”) to third parties in
    transactions that qualify as “true-sales.” Certain of
    these finance receivables are sold to third parties on a
    one-time, non-recourse basis, while others are sold to third
    parties under committed facilities that involve contractual
    commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying
    receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
    facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be
    renewed on an annual basis. Certain sales



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

may be made through separate legal entities that are also
    consolidated by the Company. The Company may or may not retain
    the obligation to service the sold finance receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2007, these committed
    facilities provided for up to $1.4 billion to be
    outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
    up to $1.3 billion provided at December 31, 2006 and
    up to $1.1 billion provided at December 31, 2005. As
    of December 31, 2007, $497 million of these committed
    facilities were utilized, compared to $817 million utilized
    at December 31, 2006 and $585 million utilized at
    December 31, 2005. Certain events could cause one of these
    facilities to terminate. In addition, before receivables can be
    sold under certain of the committed facilities, they may need to
    meet contractual requirements, such as credit quality or
    insurability.

Total finance receivables sold by the Company were
    $4.9 billion in 2007 (including $4.7 billion of
    short-term receivables), compared to $6.4 billion sold in
    2006 (including $6.2 billion of short-term receivables) and
    $4.5 billion sold in 2005 (including $4.2 billion of
    short-term receivables). As of December 31, 2007, there
    were $978 million of receivables outstanding under these
    programs for which the Company retained servicing obligations
    (including $587 million of short-term receivables),
    compared to $1.1 billion outstanding at December 31,
    2006 (including $789 million of short-term receivables) and
    $1.0 billion outstanding at December 31, 2005
    (including $838 million of short-term receivables).

Under certain receivables programs, the value of the receivables
    sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from independent
    insurance companies, less deductibles or self-insurance
    requirements under the policies (with the Company retaining
    credit exposure for the remaining portion). The Company’s
    total credit exposure to outstanding short-term receivables that
    have been sold was $23 million at December 31, 2007,
    as compared to $19 million at December 31, 2006.
    Reserves of $1 million and $4 million were recorded
    for potential losses on sold receivables at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Adequate
    Internal and External Funding Resources

The Company believes that it has adequate internal and external
    resources available to fund expected working capital and capital
    expenditure requirements for the next twelve months as supported
    by the level of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments
    and Sigma Fund balances in the U.S., the ability to repatriate
    cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and Sigma Fund
    balances from foreign jurisdictions, the ability to borrow under
    the committed credit facility or future credit facilities, the
    ability to issue commercial paper, and access to the short-term
    and long-term debt markets.

Other
    Contingencies

Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying
    Contract Value:

In certain circumstances, our
    businesses may enter into contracts with customers pursuant to
    which the damages that could be claimed by the other party for
    failed performance might exceed the revenue the Company receives
    from the contract. Contracts with these sorts of uncapped damage
    provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still
    represent meaningful risk. There is a possibility that a damage
    claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result
    in expenses to the Company that are far in excess of the revenue
    received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.

Indemnification Provisions:

In addition, the
    Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from
    the breach of general warranties contained in certain
    commercial, intellectual property and divestiture agreements.
    Historically, the Company has not made significant payments
    under these agreements, nor have there been significant claims
    asserted against the Company. However, there is an increasing
    risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the
    current legal climate. In all indemnification cases, payment by
    the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim
    pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract,
    which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the
    other party’s claims. Further, the Company’s
    obligations under these agreements for indemnification based on
    breach of representations and warranties are generally limited
    in terms of duration, typically not more than 24 months,
    and for amounts not in excess of the contract value, and in some
    instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties
    for certain payments made by the Company.

Legal Matters:

The Company has several
    lawsuits filed against it relating to the Iridium program, as
    further described under Part I, Item 3: Legal
    Proceedings of this document. The Company has not reserved for
    any potential liability that may arise as a result of
    U.S. litigation related to the Iridium program. While the
    still pending



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

cases are in various stages and the outcomes are not
    predictable, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these
    cases could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of
    operations.

The Company is a defendant in various other lawsuits, claims and
    actions which arise in the normal course of business. These
    include actions relating to products, contracts and securities,
    as well as matters initiated by third parties or Motorola
    relating to infringements of patents, violations of licensing
    arrangements and other intellectual property-related matters. In
    the opinion of management, and other than discussed above with
    respect to the still pending Iridium cases, the ultimate
    disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or results of operations.

Segment
    Information

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the
    financial results of each reporting segment as detailed in
    Note 11, “Information by Segment and Geographic
    Region,” to the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Net sales and operating results for the
    Company’s three operating segments for 2007, 2006 and 2005
    are presented below.

Segment
    Results—2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, the segment’s net sales were $19.0 billion, a
    decrease of 33% compared to net sales of $28.4 billion in
    2006. The 33% decrease in net sales was primarily driven by:
    (i) a 27% decrease in unit shipments, (ii) a 9%
    decrease in average selling price (“ASP”), and
    (iii) decreased revenue from intellectual property and
    technology licensing. The segment’s product sales were
    negatively impacted by gaps in the segment’s product
    portfolio, including limited offerings of 3G products and
    products for the Multimedia and Mass Market product segments, as
    well as an aging product portfolio. On a product technology
    basis, net sales of products for: (i) GSM technology
    decreased substantially, (ii) iDEN and CDMA technologies
    decreased, and (iii) 3G technologies increased slightly. On
    a geographic basis, net sales decreased in all regions, and
    decreased substantially in the Asia and Europe, Middle East and
    Africa (“EMEA”) regions. The substantial decrease in
    Asia, particularly in China, as well as in other emerging
    markets, was due to lower demand for our products as a result of
    an aging product portfolio and increased industry-wide
    competition. The substantial decrease in EMEA was due to gaps in
    our product portfolio, particularly 3G products.

The segment incurred an operating loss of $1.2 billion in
    2007, compared to operating earnings of $2.7 billion in
    2006. The operating loss was primarily due to a decrease in
    gross margin, driven by: (i) a 9% decrease in ASP,
    (ii) decreased income from intellectual property and
    technology licensing, (iii) a 27% decrease in unit
    shipments, and (iv) a $277 million charge for a legal
    settlement with Freescale Semiconductor, partially offset by
    savings from supply chain cost-reduction initiatives.

Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
    increased, driven by increased expenditures on developmental
    engineering for new products and software, as well as ongoing
    investment in next-generation technologies, partially offset by
    savings from cost-reduction initiatives. The segment’s
    industry typically experiences short life cycles for new
    products. Therefore, it is vital to the segment’s success
    that new, compelling products are constantly introduced.
    Accordingly, a strong commitment to R&D is required to fuel
    long-term growth. Reorganization of business charges increased
    due to employee severance costs and expenses related to the exit
    of a



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

facility. Selling, general and administrative
    (“SG&A”) expenses decreased primarily due to
    lower marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction
    initiatives, partially offset by increased expenditures on
    information technology upgrades. As a percentage of net sales in
    2007 as compared to 2006, gross margin and operating margin
    decreased, and SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures
    increased.

The segment’s backlog was $647 million at
    December 31, 2007, compared to $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2006. This decrease in backlog is primarily
    due to a decline in customer demand driven by the gaps in the
    segment’s product portfolio.

The segment shipped 159.1 million units in 2007, a 27%
    decrease compared to shipments of 217.4 million units in
    2006. The overall decrease reflects decreased unit shipments of
    products for all technologies. For the full year 2007, unit
    shipments: (i) decreased substantially in Asia and EMEA,
    (ii) decreased in North America, and (iii) increased
    in Latin America. Although unit shipments by the segment
    decreased in 2007, total unit shipments in the worldwide handset
    market increased by 16%. The segment estimates its worldwide
    market share to be approximately 14% for the full year 2007, a
    decrease of approximately 8 percentage points versus full
    year 2006.

In 2007, ASP decreased approximately 9% compared to 2006. The
    overall decrease in ASP was driven primarily by changes in the
    product-tier and geographic mix of sales. By comparison, ASP
    decreased approximately 11% in 2006 and 10% in 2005. ASP is
    impacted by numerous factors, including product mix, market
    conditions and competitive product offerings, and ASP trends
    often vary over time.

The largest of the segment’s end customers (including sales
    through distributors) are Sprint Nextel, AT&T, Verizon,
    China Mobile, and America Movil. In 2007, aggregate net sales to
    these five customers accounted for approximately 42% of the
    segment’s net sales in 2007. Besides selling directly to
    carriers and operators, the segment also sells products through
    a variety of third-party distributors and retailers, which
    account for approximately 33% of the segment’s net sales.
    The largest of these distributors is Brightstar Corporation. The
    loss of any of the segment’s key customers could have a
    significant impact on the segment’s business.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
    largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
    54% of our segment’s 2007 net sales, were outside the
    U.S. The largest of these international markets are Brazil,
    China and Mexico.

In January 2008, the Company announced that it is evaluating
    alternatives for the structural and strategic realignment of the
    Mobile Devices business to better equip it to recapture global
    market leadership and enhance shareholder value. This may
    include the separation of the Mobile Devices business from
    Motorola’s other businesses to permit each to grow and
    better serve their customers.

Segment
    Results—2006 Compared to 2005

In 2006, the segment’s net sales increased 32% to
    $28.4 billion, compared to $21.5 billion in 2005. The
    increase in net sales was driven by a 49% increase in unit
    shipments, primarily driven by strong demand for GSM and CDMA
    handsets, partially offset by an 11% decrease in average selling
    price (“ASP”). On a product technology basis, net
    sales of products for GSM and CDMA technologies increased and
    net sales of products for iDEN and 3G technologies decreased. On
    a geographic basis, net sales increased in all regions.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
    $2.7 billion in 2006, compared to operating earnings of
    $2.2 billion in 2005. The 23% increase in operating
    earnings was primarily due to an increase in gross margin,
    driven primarily by: (i) the 49% increase in unit
    shipments, (ii) savings from supply chain cost-reduction
    initiatives, and (iii) increased income from intellectual
    property and technology licensing, partially offset by the 11%
    decline in ASP. The increase in gross margin was partially
    offset by: (i) an increase in SG&A expenses, primarily
    driven by an increase in marketing expenses to support higher
    net sales and promote brand awareness, and (ii) an increase
    in R&D expenditures, as a result of an increase in
    developmental engineering for new product development and
    software, as well as ongoing investment in next-generation
    technologies. As a percentage of net sales in 2006 as compared
    to 2005, gross margin, R&D expenditures and operating
    margin decreased and SG&A expenses increased.

The segment’s backlog was $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2006, compared to $3.0 billion at
    December 31, 2005. This decrease in backlog is primarily
    due to an unusually high level of backlog at December 31,
    2005 due to strong customer demand for new products during the
    fourth quarter of 2005, certain of which were unable to be
    shipped in significant quantities due to supply constraints for
    select components.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Unit shipments increased 49% to 217.4 million units in
    2006, compared to 146.0 million units in 2005. The overall
    increase was driven by increased unit shipments of products for
    GSM, CDMA and 3G technologies, partially offset by decreased
    unit shipments of products for iDEN technology. For the full
    year 2006, unit shipments by the segment increased in all
    regions. Due to the segment’s increase in unit shipments
    outpacing overall growth in the worldwide handset market, which
    grew approximately 20% in 2006, the segment believes that it
    expanded its global handset market share to an estimated 22% for
    the full year 2006.

In 2006, ASP decreased approximately 11% compared to 2005. The
    overall decrease in ASP was driven primarily by changes in the
    geographic and product-tier mix of sales. By comparison, ASP
    decreased approximately 10% in 2005 and increased approximately
    15% in 2004. ASP is impacted by numerous factors, including
    product mix, market conditions and competitive product
    offerings, and ASP trends often vary over time.

In 2006, the largest of the segment’s end customers
    (including sales through distributors) were China Mobile,
    Verizon, Sprint Nextel, Cingular, and

T-Mobile.

These five largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of
    the segment’s net sales in 2006. Besides selling directly
    to carriers and operators, the segment also sold products
    through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers,
    which accounted for approximately 38% of the segment’s net
    sales. The largest of these distributors was Brightstar
    Corporation.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
    largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
    65% of the segment’s 2006 net sales, were outside the
    U.S. The largest of these international markets were China,
    Brazil, the United Kingdom and Mexico.

Segment
    Results—2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, the segment’s net sales increased 9% to
    $10.0 billion, compared to $9.2 billion in 2006. The
    9% increase in net sales reflects a 27% increase in net sales in
    the home business, partially offset by a 1% decrease in net
    sales of wireless networks. Net sales of digital entertainment
    devices increased approximately 43%, reflecting increased demand
    for digital set-tops, including HD/DVR set-tops and IP set-tops,
    partially offset by a decline in ASP due to a product mix shift
    towards all-digital set-tops. Unit shipments of digital
    entertainment devices increased 51% to 15.2 million units.
    Net sales of broadband gateways increased approximately 6%,
    primarily due to higher net sales of data modems, driven by net
    sales from the Netopia business acquired in February 2007.
    Net sales of wireless networks decreased 1%, primarily driven by
    lower net sales of iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment,
    partially offset by higher net sales of GSM infrastructure
    equipment, despite competitive pricing pressure.

On a geographic basis, the 9% increase in net sales reflects
    higher net sales in all geographic regions. The increase in net
    sales in North America was driven primarily by higher sales of
    digital entertainment devices, partially offset by lower net
    sales of iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment. The increase in
    net sales in Asia was primarily due to higher net sales of GSM
    infrastructure equipment, partially offset by lower net sales of
    CDMA infrastructure equipment. The increase in net sales in EMEA
    was, primarily due to higher net sales of GSM infrastructure
    equipment, partially offset by lower demand for iDEN and CDMA
    infrastructure equipment. Net sales in North America continue to
    comprise a significant portion of the segment’s business,
    accounting for 52% of the segment’s total net sales in
    2007, compared to 56% of the segment’s total net sales in
    2006.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The segment reported operating earnings of $709 million in
    2007, compared to operating earnings of $787 million in
    2006. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a
    decrease in gross margin, driven by: (i) lower net sales of
    iDEN infrastructure equipment, and (ii) continued
    competitive pricing pressure in the market for GSM
    infrastructure equipment, partially offset by:
    (i) increased net sales of digital entertainment devices,
    and (ii) the reversal of reorganization of business
    accruals recorded in 2006 relating to employee severance which
    are no longer needed. SG&A expenses increased primarily due
    to the expenses from recently acquired businesses, partially
    offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives. R&D
    expenditures decreased primarily due to savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by expenditures by
    recently acquired businesses and continued investment in digital
    entertainment devices and WiMAX. As a percentage of net sales in
    2007 as compared to 2006, gross margin, SG&A expenses,
    R&D expenditures and operating margin all decreased. The
    segment’s gross margin percentages differ among its
    services, software and equipment products. Accordingly, the
    aggregate gross margin of the segment can fluctuate from period
    to period depending upon the relative mix of sales in the given
    period.

Due to the nature of the segment’s business, many of the
    agreements we enter into are long-term contracts that require
    sizeable investments by our customers. The segment is dependent
    upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of
    its sales. A small number of large cable television multiple
    system operators (“MSOs”) own a large portion of the
    cable systems and account for a significant portion of the total
    capital spending in the cable industry. In 2007, sales to our
    top five customers (Comcast; Verizon; KDDI, a service provider
    in Japan; China Mobile; and Sprint Nextel) represented
    approximately 43% of the segments net sales. The loss of one of
    these major customers could have a significant impact on the
    segment’s business and, because many of these contracts are
    long-term in nature, could impact revenue and earnings over
    several quarters. The segment’s backlog was
    $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to
    $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006.

In the home business, demand for the segment’s products
    depends primarily on the level of capital spending by broadband
    operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their
    communications systems, and for offering advanced services.
    During the second quarter of 2007, the segment began shipping
    digital set-tops that support the Federal Communications
    Commission (“FCC”)—mandated separable security
    requirement. FCC regulations mandating the separation of
    security functionality from set-tops went into effect on
    July 1, 2007. As a result of these regulations, many cable
    service providers accelerated their purchases of set-tops in the
    first half of 2007. Additionally, in 2007, our digital video
    customers significantly increased their purchases of the
    segment’s products and services, primarily due to increased
    demand for digital video set-tops, particularly HD/DVR set-tops.

In the wireless networks business, the segment has been a
    long-standing proponent of WiMAX and is now participating in
    over 40 WiMAX trials globally and several commercial contracts
    globally. The segment also maintained momentum in infrastructure
    development and services in 2007 by continuing to deliver
    outstanding technologies and services for wireless and wireline
    carriers.

During 2007, the segment completed the acquisitions of:
    (i) Netopia, Inc., a broadband equipment provider for DSL
    customers, which allows for phone, TV and fast Internet
    connections, (ii) Tut Systems, Inc., a leading developer of
    edge routing and video encoders, (iii) Modulus Video, Inc.,
    a provider of MPEG-4 Advanced Coding compression systems
    designed for delivery of high-value video content in IP set-top
    devices for the digital video, broadcast and satellite
    marketplaces, (iv) Terayon Communication Systems, Inc., a
    provider of real-time digital video networking applications to
    cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers
    worldwide, and (v) Leapstone Systems, Inc., a provider of
    intelligent multimedia service delivery and content management
    solutions to networks operators. These acquisitions enhance our
    ability to provide a complete end-to-end solution for the
    delivery of advanced video, voice and data services. In December
    2007, Motorola completed the sale of its embedded communication
    computing business to Emerson for $346 million in cash.

Segment
    Results—2006 Compared to 2005

In 2006, the segment’s net sales increased 1% to
    $9.2 billion, compared to $9.0 billion in 2005. The 1%
    increase in net sales reflected a 16% increase in net sales in
    the home business, partially offset by a 5% decrease in net
    sales of wireless networks. Net sales of digital entertainment
    devices increased approximately 24%, reflecting increased demand
    for HD/DVR set-tops, partially offset by a decline in ASP due to
    a product mix shift. Unit shipments of digital entertainment
    devices increased 57% to 10.1 million units. Net sales of
    broadband gateways increased approximately 18%, primarily due
    to: (i) increased unit shipments of cable modems, and
    (ii) increased ASPs for cable modems, reflecting increased
    demand for advanced voice-enabled modems. Net sales of wireless
    networks decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower demand for GSM,
    iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

On a geographic basis, the 1% increase in net sales reflects
    higher net sales in North America and EMEA, partially offset by
    lower net sales in Asia. The increase in net sales in North
    America was driven primarily by higher sales of digital
    entertainment devices, partially offset by lower demand for iDEN
    infrastructure equipment driven by customer expenditures
    returning to historic trends compared to an exceptionally strong
    2005. The increase in net sales in EMEA was driven primarily by
    higher sales of digital entertainment devices. The decrease in
    net sales in Asia was due, in part, to delays in the granting of
    3G licenses in China that led service providers to slow their
    near-term capital investment, as well as competitive pricing
    pressure. Net sales in North America continued to comprise a
    significant portion of the segment’s business, accounting
    for approximately 56% of the segment’s total net sales in
    2006, compared to approximately 55% of the segment’s total
    net sales in 2005.

The segment reported operating earnings of $787 million in
    2006, compared to operating earnings of $1.2 billion in
    2005. The 36% decrease in operating earnings was primarily due
    to: (i) a decrease in gross margin, due to an unfavorable
    product/regional mix and competitive pricing in the wireless
    networks market, and (ii) an increase in Other charges
    (income) from an increase in reorganization of business charges,
    primarily related to employee severance, and from a legal
    reserve. As a percentage of net sales in 2006 as compared to
    2005, gross margin, SG&A expenses, R&D expenditures
    and operating margin all decreased.

In 2006, net sales to the segment’s top five customers,
    which included Sprint Nextel, Comcast Corporation, Verizon, KDDI
    and China Mobile, represented 45% of the segment’s total
    net sales. The segment’s backlog was $3.2 billion at
    December 31, 2006, compared to $2.4 billion at
    December 31, 2005. The increase in backlog is primarily due
    to strong orders for our digital and HD/DVR set-tops.

In the market for digital entertainment devices, demand for the
    segment’s products depends primarily on the level of
    capital spending by broadband operators for constructing,
    rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems, and for
    offering advanced services. In 2006, our digital video customers
    significantly increased their purchases of the segment’s
    products and services, primarily due to increased demand for
    digital video set-tops, particularly HD/DVR set-tops.

During 2006, the segment completed a number of significant
    acquisitions, including: (i) Kreatel Communications AB, a
    leading developer of innovative

IP-based

digital set-tops and software, (ii) NextNet Wireless, Inc.,
    a former Clearwire Corporation subsidiary and a leading provider
    of OFDM-based non-line-of-sight (“NLOS”) wireless
    broadband infrastructure equipment, (iii) Broadbus
    Technologies, Inc., a provider of technology solutions for
    television on demand, and (iv) Vertasent LLC, a software
    developer for managing technology elements for switched digital
    video networks. These acquisitions did not have a material
    impact on the segment results in 2006.

Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions Segment

The

Enterprise Mobility Solutions

segment designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and digital
    two-way radio, voice and data communications products and
    systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and
    end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions to a wide range of
    enterprise markets, including government and public safety
    agencies (which, together with all sales to distributors of
    two-way communications products, are referred to as the
    “government and public safety market”), as well as
    retail, utility, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare and
    other commercial customers (which, collectively, are referred to
    as the “commercial enterprise market”). In 2007, the
    segment’s net sales represented 21% of the Company’s
    consolidated net sales, compared to 13% in 2006 and 14% in 2005.

Segment
    Results—2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, the segment’s net sales increased 43% to
    $7.7 billion, compared to $5.4 billion in 2006. The
    43% increase in net sales was primarily due to increased net
    sales in the commercial enterprise market, driven by the net
    sales from the Symbol business acquired in January 2007. Net
    sales in the government and public safety market increased 6%,
    primarily due to strong demand in North America. On a geographic
    basis, net sales increased in all regions.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The segment reported operating earnings of $1.2 billion in
    2007, compared to operating earnings of $958 million in
    2006. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an
    increase in gross margin in both: (i) the commercial
    enterprise market, driven by net sales from the Symbol business
    acquired in January 2007, and (ii) the government and
    public safety market, driven by strong net sales in North
    America. This improvement in gross margin was partially offset
    by: (i) an inventory-related charge in connection with the
    acquisition of Symbol, and (ii) an increase in SG&A
    and R&D expenses, primarily due to expenses from recently
    acquired businesses, partially offset by savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. As a percentage of net sales in 2007
    as compared 2006, gross margin, R&D expenditures and
    operating margin decreased, and SG&A expenses increased.

Net sales in North America continue to comprise a significant
    portion of the segment’s business, accounting for
    approximately 62% of the segment’s net sales in 2007,
    compared to approximately 63% in 2006. Our products and services
    are sold worldwide to a diverse set of customers, including
    customers involved in: government and public safety (police,
    fire, emergency management services), military, utilities,
    retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, wholesale
    and distribution, and healthcare. The segment’s backlog was
    $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to
    $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006.

In the government and public safety market, natural disasters
    and terrorist-related worldwide events continued to place an
    emphasis on mission-critical communications systems. Spending by
    the segment’s government and public safety market customers
    is affected by government budgets at the national, state and
    local levels. The scope and size of systems requested by some of
    the segment’s customers continue to increase, including
    requests for country-wide and statewide systems. These larger
    systems are more complex and include a wide range of
    capabilities. Large-system projects impact how contracts are
    bid, which companies compete for bids, and how companies partner
    on projects.

During 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of:
    (i) Symbol Technologies, Inc., a leader in designing,
    developing, manufacturing and servicing products and systems
    used in end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions, and
    (ii) Good Technology, Inc., a provider of enterprise mobile
    computing software and services. In January 2008, the segment
    acquired a controlling interest in Vertex Standard Co., Ltd., a
    global provider of two-way radio communication solutions.

Segment
    Results—2006 Compared to 2005

In 2006, the segment’s net sales increased 7% to
    $5.4 billion, compared to $5.0 billion in 2005. The 7%
    increase in net sales was primarily due to increased net sales
    in the government and public safety market, driven by increased
    demand for enhanced mission-critical communications systems. The
    net sales in the commercial enterprise market increased 14%,
    primarily due to increased demand for business-critical
    communications. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in
    all regions.

The segment reported operating earnings of $958 million in
    2006, compared to operating earnings of $860 million in
    2005. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to
    the increase in gross margin, driven by the 7% increase in net
    sales from the government and public safety market. This
    improvement in gross margin was partially offset by: (i) an
    increase in reorganization of business charges, primarily
    related to employee severance, and (ii) an increase in
    R&D expenses, driven by increased investment in
    next-generation technologies across the segment. As a percentage
    of net sales in 2007 as compared 2006, gross margin, R&D
    expenditures and operating margin increased, and SG&A
    expenses decreased.

Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant
    portion of the segment’s business, accounting for
    approximately 63% of the segment’s total net sales in 2006,
    compared to approximately 66% in 2005. The segment’s
    backlog was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006,
    compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2005.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
    experience, current economic and industry conditions and on
    various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments
    about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
    readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
    Management believes the following significant accounting
    policies require significant judgment and estimates:

— Revenue recognition

— Inventory valuation reserves

— Taxes on income

— Valuation of Sigma Fund, investments and long-lived
    assets

— Restructuring activities

— Retirement-related benefits

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s arrangements with customers may differ in
    nature and complexity and may contain multiple deliverables,
    including products, equipment, services and software that may be
    essential to the functionality of the other deliverables, which
    requires the Company to make judgments and estimates in
    recognizing revenues.

Product and equipment sales may contain discounts, price
    protection, return provisions and other customer incentives. The
    Company’s recorded revenues are reduced by allowances for
    these items at the time the sales are recorded. The allowances
    are based on management’s best estimate of the amount of
    allowances that the customer will ultimately earn and is based
    on historical experience taking into account the type of
    products sold, the type of customer and the type of transaction
    specific to each arrangement. Where customer incentives cannot
    be reliably estimated, the Company recognizes revenue at the
    time the product sells through the distribution channel to the
    end customer.

The Company’s long-term contracts may involve the design,
    engineering, manufacturing and installation of wireless and
    wireline networks and two-way radio voice and data systems.
    These systems are designed to meet specific customer
    requirements and specifications and generally require extended
    periods to complete. If the Company can reliably estimate
    revenues and contract costs and the technology is considered
    proven, revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion
    method as work progresses towards completion; otherwise, the
    revenue is recognized under the completed contract method.
    Estimates of contract revenues, contract costs and progress
    towards completion are based on estimates that consider
    historical experience and other factors believed to be relevant
    under the circumstances. Management regularly reviews these
    estimates and considers the impact of recurring business risks
    and uncertainties inherent in the contracts, such as system
    performance and implementation delays due to factors within or
    outside the control of management.

Generally, multiple element arrangements are separated into
    specific accounting units when: (i) delivered elements have
    value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (ii) objective and
    reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered
    element(s), and (iii) delivery of the undelivered element(s) is
    probable and substantially within the control of the Company.
    Total arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate
    accounting units based on their relative fair values (if the
    fair value of each accounting unit is known) or using the
    residual method (if the fair value of the undelivered element(s)
    is known). Revenue is recognized for a separate accounting unit
    when the revenue recognition criteria are met for that unit. In
    certain situations, judgment is required in determining both the
    number of accounting units and fair value of the elements,
    although generally the fair value of an element can be
    objectively determined if the Company sells the element on a
    stand-alone basis. Multiple element arrangements that include
    software are separated into more than one unit of accounting
    when the following criteria are met: (i)  the functionality
    of the delivered element(s) is not dependent on the undelivered
    element(s), (ii) there is vendor-specific objective
    evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element(s), and
    (iii) general revenue recognition criteria related to the
    delivered element(s) have been met.

Changes in cost estimates and the fair values of certain
    deliverables could negatively impact the Company’s
    operating results. In addition, unforeseen conditions could
    arise over the contract term that may have a significant impact
    on operating results.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Inventory
    Valuation Reserves

The Company records valuation reserves on its inventory for
    estimated obsolescence or non-marketability. The amount of the
    reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the
    inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions
    about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis,
    management in each segment performs an analysis of the
    underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and
    obsolescence and, for the remaining inventory, assesses the net
    realizable value. Management uses its best judgment to estimate
    appropriate reserves based on this analysis.

Inventories consisted of the following:

The Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory
    levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its
    customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to
    rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As
    reflected above, the Company’s inventory reserves
    represented 12% of the gross inventory balance at both
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Company has inventory
    reserves for pending cancellations of product lines due to
    technology changes, long-life cycle products, lifetime buys at
    the end of supplier production runs, business exits, and a shift
    of production to outsourcing.

If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, additional inventory
    writedowns may be required. Likewise, as with other reserves
    based on management’s judgment, if the reserve is no longer
    needed, amounts are reversed into income. There were no
    significant reversals into income of this type in the periods
    presented.

Taxes
    on Income

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income
    and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various
    jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated
    effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company’s
    quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a
    significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to
    be recognized, in the Company’s quarterly operating
    results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately
    calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or
    discrete item. The Company considers the resolution of
    prior-year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is
    required in determining the Company’s effective tax rate
    and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes
    reserves when it is more likely than not that the Company will
    not realize the full tax benefit of the position. The Company
    adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and
    circumstances.

Tax regulations may require items of income and expense to be
    included in a tax return in different periods than the items are
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result,
    the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial
    statements may be different than the tax rate reported in the
    income tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such
    as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some
    are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
    Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that
    can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in
    future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax
    benefit in the consolidated financial statements. The Company
    establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets
    when it is more likely than not that the amount of expected
    future taxable income will not support the use of the deduction
    or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax
    expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for
    which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company
    has already taken a deduction on an income tax return, but has
    not yet recognized as expense in the consolidated financial
    statements.

Valuation
    of Sigma Fund, Investments and Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of its Sigma Fund and
    investment portfolios and long-lived assets, including
    identifiable property, plant and equipment and intangible
    assets, whenever events or changes in



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test at
    the reporting unit level at least annually on October 1, or
    more often should triggering events occur. Factors considered
    important that could trigger an impairment review include:
    (i) underperformance relative to expected historical or
    projected future operating results, (ii) changes in the
    manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall
    business, (iii) negative industry or economic trends,
    (iv) declines in price of an investment for a sustained
    period, and (v) our market capitalization relative to net
    book value.

If it becomes probable that the Company will not collect all
    amounts in accordance with the contractual terms of a debt
    security within the Sigma Fund, the Company considers the
    decline other-than-temporary and an investment impairment is
    recorded.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
    intangible assets and long-lived assets may not be recoverable,
    an impairment charge is recorded. Impairment is generally
    measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method using
    a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with
    the risk inherent in our current business model or prevailing
    market rates of investment securities, if available.

When performing a goodwill impairment test, the fair value of
    the reporting unit is determined using a combination of present
    value techniques and quoted market prices of comparable
    businesses.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net book values of these
    assets were as follows (in millions):

The Company recorded investment impairment charges of
    $62 million, $27 million and $25 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, representing other-than-temporary
    declines in the value of the Company’s Sigma Fund and
    investment portfolios. Additionally, the available-for-sale
    securities portfolio reflected an unrealized loss position of
    $96 million and an unrealized gain position of
    $60 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company recorded fixed asset impairment charges of
    $50 million in 2007, and $15 million in both 2006 and
    2005. The Company recorded intangible asset impairment charges
    of $81 million in 2007, compared to no impairment charges
    in 2006 and 2005. No goodwill impairment charges were required
    in the periods presented.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of future
    impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might
    have on these reported asset values. Such events may include
    strategic decisions made in response to the economic conditions
    relative to product lines or operations and the impact of the
    economic environment on our customer base.

Restructuring
    Activities

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
    “Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
    eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
    and employment grade level in the event that employment is
    involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in-force

or restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in-force

has qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan.
    The Company recognizes termination benefits based on formulas
    per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future
    settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on
    estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved
    by management. Exit costs primarily consist of future minimum
    lease payments on vacated facilities. At each reporting date,
    the Company evaluates its accruals for exit costs and employee
    separation costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate.
    In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer required
    because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because
    employees previously identified for separation resigned from the
    Company and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to
    circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
    initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the income
    statement line item where the original charges were recorded
    when it is determined they are no longer required.

Retirement-Related
    Benefits

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
    “Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
    became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
    is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
    Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
    eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. The Company
    also provides defined benefit plans which cover non-U.S.
    employees in certain jurisdictions, principally the United
    Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Japan and Korea (the “Non-U.S.
    Plans”). Any other pension plans are not material to the
    Company either individually or in the aggregate.

The Company also has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
    benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
    elected officers. The Officers’ Plan contains provisions
    for vesting and funding the participants’ expected
    retirement benefits when the participants meet the minimum age
    and years of service requirements. Elected officers who were not
    yet vested in the Officers’ Plan as of December 31,
    1999 had the option to remain in the Officers’ Plan or
    elect to have their benefit bought out in restricted stock
    units. Effective December 31, 1999, newly elected officers
    are not eligible to participate in the Officers’ Plan.
    Effective June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
    retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
    (“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits in
    excess of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code
    on the Regular Pension Plan. Elected officers covered under the
    Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
    buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective
    January 1, 2005, newly hired employees were not eligible to
    participate in the MSPP. Effective January 1, 2007,
    eligible compensation has been capped at the IRS limit plus
    $175,000 or, for those in excess of this cap at January 1,
    2007, the eligible compensation used to compute the
    employee’s MSPP benefit is the greater of: (i) the
    employee’s frozen January 1, 2007 eligible
    compensation amount, or (ii) the earnings cap for the given
    year.

In February 2007, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan
    and the MSPP, modifying the definition of average earnings. For
    years ended prior to December 31, 2007, benefits were
    calculated using the rolling average of the highest annual
    earnings in any five years within the previous ten calendar year
    period. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit calculation will
    be based on the set of the five highest years of earnings within
    the ten calendar years prior to December 31, 2007, averaged
    with earnings from each year after 2007. Also effective January
    2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, modifying
    the vesting period from five years to three years.

Certain healthcare benefits are available to eligible domestic
    employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
    termination of employment (the “Postretirement Health Care
    Benefits Plan”). For eligible employees hired prior to
    January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
    postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
    January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefits
    Plan has been closed to new participants.

Accounting methodologies use an attribution approach that
    generally spreads individual events over the service lives of
    the employees in the plan. Examples of “events” are
    plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as
    discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,
    and rate of compensation increases. The principle underlying the
    required attribution approach is that employees render service
    over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and,
    therefore, the income statement effects of pension benefits or
    postretirement health care benefits are earned in, and should be
    expensed in, the same pattern.

There are various assumptions used in calculating the net
    periodic benefit expense and related benefit obligations. One of
    these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets. The required use of expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income
    that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan
    assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected
    long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual
    long-term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income
    and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of
    the services provided by the employees. Differences between
    actual and expected returns are recognized in the net periodic
    pension calculation over five years.

The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience
    with consideration of the expected investment mix of the
    plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term
    investment returns, to develop its expected rate of return
    assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost and
    the net retirement healthcare expense. The Company’s
    investment return assumption for the Regular Pension Plan and
    Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan was 8.5% in 2007 and
    2006. The investment return assumption for the Officers’
    Plan was 6% in 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007, the
    Regular Pension Plan and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits
    Plan investment portfolio were predominantly equity investments
    and the Officers’ Plan investment portfolio was
    predominantly fixed-income securities.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate
    assumptions used for pension benefits and postretirement health
    care benefits accounting reflects, at December 31 of each year,
    the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income debt
    instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the
    measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows
    to pay the benefit obligation when due. The Company’s
    discount rates for measuring its U.S. pension obligations were
    6.75% and 6% at December 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    Company’s discount rates for measuring the Postretirement
    Health Care Benefits Plan obligation were 6.5% and 5.75% at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

A final set of assumptions involves the cost drivers of the
    underlying benefits. The rate of compensation increase is a key
    assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting
    and is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans
    for such increases. In both 2007 and 2006, the Company’s
    rate for future compensation increase was 4% for the Regular
    Pension Plan. The Company’s 2007 and 2006 rate for future
    compensation increase for the Officers’ Plan was 0%, as the
    salaries to be utilized for calculation of benefits under this
    plan have been frozen. For Postretirement Health Care Benefits
    Plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own
    historical trends for health care costs to determine the health
    care cost trend rates. Based on this review, the health care
    cost trend rate used to determine the December 31, 2007
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is 9% for 2008,
    with a declining trend rate of 1% each year until it reaches 5%
    by 2012, with a flat 5% rate for 2012 and beyond.

The 2007 and 2006 Regular Plan actual expenses were
    $174 million and $240 million, respectively. Cash
    contributions of $270 million were made to the Regular
    Pension Plan in 2007. The Company expects to make cash
    contributions of approximately $240 million to its
    U.S. pension plans and approximately $50 million to
    its

non-U.S. pension

plans during 2008.

The 2007 and 2006 Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan
    actual expenses were $15 million and $22 million,
    respectively. Cash contributions of $15 million were made
    to this plan in 2007. The Company expects to make cash
    contributions of approximately $20 million to the
    Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in 2008.

The impact on the future financial results of the Company in
    relation to retirement-related benefits is dependent on economic
    conditions, employee demographics, interest rates and investment
    performance. The Company’s measurement date of its plan
    assets and obligations is December 31.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”)
    effective January 1, 2007. Among other things FIN 48
    prescribes a “more-likely-than-not” threshold to the
    recognition and de-recognition of tax positions, provides
    guidance on the accounting for interest and penalties relating
    to tax positions and requires that the cumulative effect of
    applying the provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an
    adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other
    appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement
    of financial position. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a
    $120 million reduction of the Company’s unrecognized
    tax benefits and related interest accrual and has been reflected
    as an increase in the opening balance of Retained earnings of
    $27 million and Additional

paid-in

capital of $93 million as of January 1, 2007. Upon
    adoption of FIN 48, the Company also reclassified
    unrecognized tax benefits of $877 million from Deferred
    income taxes to Other liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”).
    SFAS 158 has certain recognition and disclosure
    requirements which the Company adopted as of December 31,
    2006. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires employers to measure
    defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of
    the statement of financial position. The measurement date
    provision of SFAS 158 only affects the Company’s

non-U.S. pension

plans. The Company adopted the measurement date provisions for
    its

Non-U.S. plans

as of December 31, 2007. Upon adoption of the measurement
    provisions, the Company recorded $17 million, net of
    $2 million of taxes, as a decrease in the opening balance
    of Retained earnings at January 1, 2007 in the consolidated
    statements of stockholders’ equity.

In September 2006, the FASB issued

EITF 06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-4”).

EITF 06-4

requires that endorsement split-dollar life insurance
    arrangements which provide a benefit to an employee beyond the
    postretirement period be recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 106, “Employer’s Accounting for
    Postretirement

Benefits Other Than Pensions” or APB Opinion No. 12,
    “Omnibus Opinion—1967” (“the
    Statements”) based on the substance of the agreement with
    the employee. Under the provisions of these Statements, a
    liability should be accrued equal to the actuarial present value
    of the future death benefit over the service period.

EITF 06-4

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007. The Company will adopt

EITF 06-4

as of January 1, 2008 and anticipates that the adoption of
    this pronouncement will result in an increase in Other
    liabilities of approximately $50 million with the offset
    reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment to Retained earnings.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value as required by other accounting
    pronouncements and expands fair value measurement disclosures.
    SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. In February of 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position

157-2

which
    delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial
    assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and
    losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected
    will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting
    date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing
    the impact of SFAS 159 on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes new
    standards for the accounting for and reporting of
    non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and for
    the loss of control of partially owned and consolidated
    subsidiaries. SFAS 160 does not change the criteria for
    consolidating a partially owned entity. SFAS 160 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be applied
    prospectively upon adoption except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively.
    The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 will
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised
    2007) (“SFAS 141R”), a revision of SFAS 141,
    “Business Combinations.” SFAS 141R establishes
    requirements for the recognition and measurement of acquired
    assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non-controlling interests.
    SFAS 141R also provides disclosure requirements related to
    business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R
    will be applied prospectively to business combinations with an
    acquisition date on or after the effective date.

    or our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, could
    cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated
    in the forward-looking statements.



Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall
    exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.
    The Company’s policy prohibits speculation in financial
    instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
    trading in currencies for which there are no underlying
    exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to
    intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
    are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be
    effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
    being hedged and are designated as a part of a hedging
    relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
    changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
    correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
    items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of
    the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
    is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments
    against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
    or investments based on the operating business units’
    assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts
    for some of the Company’s non-functional currency
    receivables and payables, which are primarily denominated in
    major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company
    uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency
    exposures. In addition, the Company enters into derivative
    contracts for some firm commitments and some forecasted
    transactions, which are designated as part of a hedging
    relationship if it is determined that the transaction qualifies
    for hedge accounting under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” A portion of the
    Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not traded
    in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent
    reasonably possible, through managing net asset positions,
    product pricing and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had net
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
    $3.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.
    Management believes that these financial instruments should not
    subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
    movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
    offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities
    and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the
    instruments, which are charged to Other within Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. The following table shows, in millions of
    U.S. dollars, the five largest net foreign exchange
    contract positions as of December 31, 2007 and the
    corresponding positions as of December 31, 2006:

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial
    instruments. The Company minimizes its credit risk on these
    transactions by only dealing with leading, creditworthy
    financial institutions and does not anticipate nonperformance.
    In addition, the contracts are distributed among several
    financial institutions, all of whom presently have investment
    grade credit ratings, thus minimizing credit risk concentration.

Foreign exchange financial instruments that are subject to the
    effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect reported
    earnings, include derivative financial instruments and other
    financial instruments which are not denominated in the
    functional currency of the legal entity holding the instrument.
    Derivative financial instruments consist primarily of forward
    contracts and currency options. Other financial instruments,
    which are not denominated in the functional currency of the
    legal entity holding the instrument, consist primarily of cash,
    cash equivalents, Sigma Fund investments and short-term
    investments, as well as accounts payable and receivable.
    Accounts payable and receivable are reflected at fair value in
    the financial statements. The fair value of the foreign exchange
    financial instruments would hypothetically decrease by
    $330 million as of December 31, 2007 if the foreign
    currency rates were to change unfavorably by 10% from current
    levels. This hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on
    future cash flows under the following conditions: (i) all
    current payables and receivables that are hedged were not
    realized, (ii) all hedged commitments and anticipated
    transactions were not realized or canceled, and
    (iii) hedges of these amounts were not canceled or offset.
    The Company does not expect that any of these conditions will be
    realized. The Company expects that gains and losses on the
    derivative financial instruments should offset gains and



losses on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being
    hedged. If the hedged transactions were included in the
    sensitivity analysis, the hypothetical change in fair value
    would be immaterial. The foreign exchange financial instruments
    are held for purposes other than trading.

The Company recorded income of $0.6 million and
    $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, representing the ineffective portions of
    changes in the fair value of fair value hedge positions. The
    ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of foreign
    currency fair value hedge positions in 2007 was de minimis.
    These amounts are included in Other within Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. The above amounts include the change in the fair
    value of derivative contracts related to the changes in the
    difference between the spot price and the forward price. These
    amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness. Expense
    (income) related to fair value hedges that were discontinued for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are
    included in the amounts noted above.

The Company recorded income of $1 million, $13 million
    and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, representing the ineffective
    portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedge
    positions. These amounts are included in Other within Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations. The above amounts include the change in the fair
    value of derivative contracts related to the changes in the
    difference between the spot price and the forward price. These
    amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness. Expense
    (income) related to cash flow hedges that were discontinued for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are
    included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, on
    a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $(16) million,
    $(98) million and $21 million, respectively, was
    reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations.

At December 31, 2007, the maximum term of derivative
    instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was one year.
    However, the weighted average duration of the Company’s
    derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
    five months.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2007, the Company’s short-term debt
    consisted primarily of $134 million of short-term foreign
    debt, priced at short-term interest rates. The Company has
    $4.2 billion of long-term debt, including the current
    portion of long-term debt, which is primarily priced at
    long-term, fixed interest rates.

In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
    debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
    to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
    fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
    payments. The following table displays these outstanding
    interest rate swaps at December 31, 2007:

The weighted average short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
    payments on each of the above interest rate swaps was 6.60% for
    the three months ended December 31, 2007. The fair value of
    the above interest rate swaps at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, was $36 million and
    $(47) million, respectively. The fair value of the above
    interest rate swaps would hypothetically decrease by
    $38 million (i.e., would decrease from $36 million to
    $(2) million) if LIBOR were to change unfavorably by 10%
    from current levels. Except as noted below, the Company had no
    outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options
    relating to debt instruments at December 31, 2007 or
    December 31, 2006.



The Company designated the above interest rate swap agreements
    as part of fair value hedging relationships. As such, changes in
    the fair value of the hedging instrument, as well as the hedged
    debt are recognized in earnings, therefore adjusting the
    carrying amount of the debt. Interest expense on the debt is
    adjusted to include the payments made or received under such
    hedge agreements. In 2007, the Company recorded an expense of
    $2.3 million representing the ineffective portions of
    changes in the fair value of interest rate swap hedge positions.
    These amounts are included in Other within Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. In the event the underlying debt instrument matures
    or is redeemed or repurchased, the Company is likely to
    terminate the corresponding interest rate swap contracts.

Additionally, one of the Company’s European subsidiaries
    has outstanding interest rate agreements (“Interest
    Agreements”) relating to a Euro-denominated loan. The
    interest on the Euro-denominated loan is floating based on

3-month

EURIBOR plus a spread. The Interest Agreements change the
    characteristics of interest rate payments from short-term
    EURIBOR based variable payments to maximum fixed-rate payments.
    The Interest Agreements are not accounted for as a part of a
    hedging relationship and, accordingly, the changes in the fair
    value of the Interest Agreements are included in Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. The weighted average fixed rate payments on these
    EURIBOR interest rate agreements was 6.71%. The fair value of
    the Interest Agreements at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006 was $3 million and $1 million,
    respectively. The fair value of the Interest Agreements would
    hypothetically decrease by $2 million (i.e., would decrease
    from $3 million to $1 million) if EURIBOR rates were
    to change unfavorably by 10% from current levels.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
    Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
    dealing with leading, creditworthy financial institutions and
    does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts
    are distributed among several financial institutions, all of
    whom presently have investment grade credit ratings, thus
    minimizing credit risk concentration.

Net
    Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any
    hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
    foreign operations.

Investments
    Hedge

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into a
    zero-cost collar derivative (the “Sprint Nextel
    Derivative”) to protect itself economically against price
    fluctuations in its 37.6 million shares of Sprint Nextel
    Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) non-voting common stock.
    During the second quarter of 2006, as a result of Sprint
    Nextel’s spin-off of Embarq Corporation through a dividend
    to Sprint Nextel shareholders, the Company received
    approximately 1.9 million shares of Embarq Corporation. The
    floor and ceiling prices of the Sprint Nextel Derivative were
    adjusted accordingly. The Sprint Nextel Derivative was not
    designated as a hedge under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Accordingly, to
    reflect the change in fair value of the Sprint Nextel
    Derivative, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, included in Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations. In December 2006, the Sprint Nextel Derivative
    was terminated and settled in cash and the 37.6 million
    shares of Sprint Nextel were converted to common shares and
    sold. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of
    approximately $820 million from the settlement of the
    Sprint Nextel Derivative and the subsequent sale of the
    37.6 million Sprint Nextel shares. The Company recognized a
    loss of $126 million in connection with the sale of the
    remaining shares of Sprint Nextel common stock. As described
    above, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million in
    connection with the Sprint Nextel Derivative.

Prior to the merger of Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”)
    and Nextel Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”), the
    Company had entered into variable share forward purchase
    agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) to hedge its
    Nextel common stock. The Company did not designate the Variable
    Forwards as a hedge of the Sprint Nextel shares received as a
    result of the merger. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    $51 million of gains for the year ended December 31,
    2005 reflecting the change in value of the Variable Forwards.
    The Variable Forwards were settled during the fourth quarter of
    2005.



Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
    equivalents, Sigma Fund investments, short-term investments,
    accounts receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts
    payable, accrued liabilities, derivatives and other financing
    commitments. The Company’s Sigma Fund and investment
    portfolios and derivatives are recorded in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at fair value. All other financial
    instruments, with the exception of long-term debt, are carried
    at cost, which is not materially different than the
    instruments’ fair values.

Using quoted market prices and market interest rates, the
    Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at
    December 31, 2007 was $4.2 billion, compared to a
    carrying value of $4.2 billion. Since considerable judgment
    is required in interpreting market information, the fair value
    of the long-term debt is not necessarily indicative of the
    amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.

Equity
    Price Market Risk

At December 31, 2007, the Company’s available-for-sale
    securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value of
    $333 million, which represented a cost basis of
    $372 million and a net unrealized loss of $39 million.
    The value of the available-for-sale securities would change by
    $33 million as of year-end 2007 if the price of the stock
    in each of the publicly-traded companies were to change by 10%.
    These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,

    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred

    position of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in

    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

. Also, as discussed in Notes 1
    and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, effective

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Motorola, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

Motorola,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all
    controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and
    balances have been eliminated. The Company’s investments in
    non-controlled entities in which it has the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies are
    accounted for by the equity method. The Company’s
    investments in other entities are accounted for using the cost
    method.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company’s
    material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of
    activities, from the delivery of stand-alone equipment to custom
    design and installation over a period of time to bundled sales
    of equipment, software and services. The Company recognizes
    revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable,
    and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. In
    addition to these general revenue recognition criteria, the
    following specific revenue recognition policies are followed:

Products and Equipment

—For product and equipment
    sales, revenue recognition generally occurs when products or
    equipment have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the
    customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance
    provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and
    allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer
    incentives can be reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are
    reduced by these allowances. The Company bases its estimates on
    historical experience taking into consideration the type of
    products sold, the type of customer, and the type of transaction
    specific in each arrangement. Where customer incentives cannot
    be reliably estimated, the Company recognizes revenue at the
    time the product sells through the distribution channel to the
    end customer.

Long-Term Contracts

—For long-term contracts that
    involve customization of the Company’s equipment or
    software, the Company generally recognizes revenue using the
    percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs
    incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs to
    complete the contract. In certain instances, when revenues or
    costs associated with long-term contracts cannot be reliably
    estimated or the contract involves unproven technologies or
    other inherent hazards, revenues and costs are deferred until
    the project is complete and customer acceptance is obtained.
    When current estimates of total contract revenue and contract
    costs indicate a contract loss, the loss is recognized in the
    period it becomes evident.

Services

—Revenue for services is generally
    recognized ratably over the contract term as services are
    performed.

Software and Licenses

—Revenue from pre-paid
    perpetual licenses is recognized at the inception of the
    arrangement, presuming all other relevant revenue recognition
    criteria are met. Revenue from non-perpetual licenses or term
    licenses is recognized ratably over the period that the licensee
    uses the license. Revenue from software maintenance, technical
    support and unspecified upgrades is generally recognized over
    the period that these services are delivered.

Multiple Element Arrangements

—Arrangements with
    customers may include multiple deliverables, including any
    combination of products, equipment, services and software. For
    multiple element arrangements which include software or
    software-related elements, the Company applies the provisions of
    AICPA Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” to determine separate
    units of accounting and the amount of the arrangement fee to be
    allocated to those separate units of accounting. Multiple
    element arrangements that include software are separated into
    more than one unit of accounting when the following criteria are
    met: (i) the functionality of the delivered element(s) is
    not dependent on the undelivered element(s), (ii) there is
    vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of the
    undelivered element(s), and (iii) general revenue
    recognition criteria related to the delivered element(s) have
    been met. If any of these criteria are not met, revenue is
    deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been
    delivered.

For all other multiple element arrangements, deliverables are
    separated into more than one unit of accounting when the
    following criteria are met: (i) the delivered element(s)
    have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis,
    (ii) objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists
    for the undelivered element(s), and (iii) delivery of the
    undelivered element(s) is probable and substantially in the
    control of the Company. Revenue is allocated to each



unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each
    accounting unit or using the residual method if objective
    evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered
    element(s). If any of these criteria are not met, revenue is
    deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been
    delivered.

When elements of an arrangement are separated into more than one
    unit of accounting, revenue is recognized for each separate unit
    of accounting based on the nature of the revenue as described
    above.

Sales and Use Taxes—

The Company records taxes
    imposed on revenue-producing transactions, including sales, use,
    value added and excise taxes, on a net basis with such taxes
    excluded from revenue.

Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all
    highly-liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
    three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Sigma Fund:

The Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries invested most of their excess cash in a fund (the
    “Sigma Fund”) that is similar to a money market fund.
    During 2007, the Company liquidated a similar second fund and
    now maintains only one fund. The Sigma Fund portfolio is managed
    by four major independent investment management firms.
    Investments are made in high-quality, investment grade (rated at
    least

A/A-1

by S&P or

A2/P-1

by
    Moody’s at purchase date), U.S. dollar-denominated
    debt obligations including certificates of deposit, commercial
    paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and asset- and
    mortgage-backed securities. The Sigma Fund’s investment
    policies require that floating rate instruments must have a
    maturity, at purchase date, that does not exceed thirty-six
    months with an interest rate reset at least annually. The
    average reset maturity of the investments held by the funds must
    be 120 days or less with the actual average reset maturity
    of the investments being 40 days and 53 days at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. While the Sigma
    Fund includes some securities with maturities beyond one year,
    the fund is classified as short-term because it represents the
    investments of cash available for current operating needs.

Investments in the Sigma Fund are designated as
    available-for-sale securities recorded at fair value. As of
    December 31, 2006, the fair value of the Sigma Fund was
    approximated by the amortized cost method. Under this method,
    investments were valued at cost when purchased and thereafter, a
    constant proportionate amortization of any discount or premium
    is recorded until maturity of the security. During the year
    ended 2007, the Sigma Fund fair value was no longer approximated
    by the amortized cost method and, accordingly, an unrealized
    holding loss was recorded.

For all available-for-sale securities, any unrealized holding
    gains and losses, net of taxes, are excluded from operating
    results and are recognized as a component of Non-owner changes
    to equity until realized. The fair values of the securities are
    determined based on prevailing market prices. The Company
    assesses declines in the value of individual investments to
    determine whether such decline is other-than-temporary. This
    assessment is made by considering available evidence, including
    changes in general market conditions, specific industry and
    individual company data, the length of time and the extent to
    which the market has been less than cost, the financial
    condition and near-term prospects of the individual issuing
    entity, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the
    investment until recovery. Other-than-temporary impairments are
    charged to Other, as presented in Other income (expense) within
    the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, in the
    period in which they become impaired.

Investments:

Investments include
    available-for-sale equity securities, held-to-maturity debt
    securities at amortized cost, securities that are restricted for
    more than one year or not publicly traded at cost, and equity
    method investments.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the
    lower of average cost (which approximates computation on a

first-in,

first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement
    cost).

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is recorded using straight-line and
    declining-balance methods, based on the estimated useful lives
    of the assets (buildings and building equipment,
    5-40 years; machinery and equipment, 2-10 years) and
    commences once the assets are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill is
    not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least
    annually on October 1. The goodwill impairment test is
    performed at the reporting unit level and is a two-step
    analysis. First, the fair value (“FV”) of each
    reporting unit is compared to its book value. If the FV of the
    reporting unit is less than its book value, the Company performs
    a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting
    unit’s FV to determine the FV of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill. FV is determined using a combination of present value
    techniques and quoted market prices of comparable businesses.



Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated
    useful lives ranging from one to 14 years. The Company has
    no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

Long-lived
    assets, which include intangible assets, held and used by the
    Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may
    not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of
    assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of
    an asset (group) to future net undiscounted cash flows to be
    generated by the asset (group). If an asset is considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount
    by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    asset’s fair value calculated using a discounted future
    cash flows analysis or market comparables. Assets held for sale,
    if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
    value less cost to sell.

Deferred Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
    attributable to differences between the financial statement
    carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry
    forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
    enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period
    that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability
    of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is
    more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
    will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the
    portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be
    realized based on the level of historical taxable income,
    projections for future taxable income over the periods in which
    the temporary differences are deductible and allowable tax
    planning strategies. Beginning January 1, 2007, the Company
    recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining
    those positions is more likely than not. Changes in recognition
    or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in
    judgment occurs. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Company
    recognized the effect of income tax positions only if such
    positions were probable of being sustained.

The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in Interest expense and penalties in Selling, general
    and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations.

Finance Receivables:

Finance receivables
    include trade receivables where contractual terms of the note
    agreement are greater than one year. Finance receivables are
    considered impaired when management determines collection of all
    amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note
    agreement, including principal and interest, is no longer
    probable. Impaired finance receivables are valued based on the
    present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the
    receivable’s effective rate of interest, or the fair value
    of the collateral if the receivable is collateral dependent.
    Interest income and late fees on impaired finance receivables
    are recognized only when payments are received. Previously
    impaired finance receivables are no longer considered impaired
    and are reclassified to performing when they have performed
    under a workout or restructuring for four consecutive quarters.

Foreign Currency:

Certain of the
    Company’s

non-U.S. operations

use their respective local currency as their functional
    currency. Those operations that do not have the U.S. dollar
    as their functional currency translate assets and liabilities at
    current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date
    and revenues and expenses using the prior period month-end
    exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are
    included as a component of Non-owner changes to equity in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets. For those operations
    that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
    transactions denominated in the local currency are measured into
    U.S. dollars using the current rates of exchange for
    monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange
    for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from remeasurement of
    monetary assets and liabilities are included in Other included
    in Other income (expense) within the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations.

Derivative Instruments:

Gains and losses on
    hedges of existing assets or liabilities are marked-to-market
    and the result is included in Other within Other income
    (expense) within the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. Gains and losses on financial instruments that
    qualify for hedge accounting and are used to hedge firm future
    commitments or forecasted transactions are deferred until such
    time as the underlying transactions are recognized or recorded
    immediately when the transaction is no longer expected to occur.
    Gains or losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as
    hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“SFAS 133”) are recognized immediately as income
    or expense.

Earnings Per Share:

The Company calculates its
    basic earnings per share based on the weighted-average effect of
    all common shares issued and outstanding. Net earnings is
    divided by the weighted average common



shares outstanding during the period to arrive at the basic
    earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by
    dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number
    of common shares used in the basic earnings per share
    calculation and the weighted average number of common shares
    that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all
    potentially dilutive securities, excluding those securities that
    would be anti-dilutive to the earnings (loss) per share
    calculation. Both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share
    amounts are calculated for earnings (loss) from continuing
    operations and net earnings (loss) for all periods presented.

Share-Based Compensation Costs:

The Company
    has incentive plans that reward employees with stock options and
    restricted stock, as well as an employee stock purchase plan.
    Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company applied the intrinsic
    value method of accounting for share-based compensation. On
    January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”) using the modified prospective
    transition method. The Company had previously disclosed the fair
    value of its stock options in its footnotes. The Company’s
    consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2005 have not been restated to reflect, and do
    not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. The amount of
    compensation cost for share-based awards is measured based on
    the fair value of the awards, as determined by the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model, as of the date that the share-based awards
    are issued and adjusted for the estimated number of awards that
    are expected to vest. Compensation cost for share-based awards
    is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Retirement Benefits:

The Company records
    annual expenses relating to its pension benefit and
    postretirement plans based on calculations which include various
    actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed asset
    rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and
    health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial
    assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the
    assumptions based on current rates and trends. The effects of
    the gains, losses, and prior service costs and credits are
    amortized over future service periods. The funding status, or
    projected benefit obligation less plan assets, for each plan, is
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets
    using a December 31 measurement date.

Advertising Expense:

Advertising expenses,
    which are the external costs of marketing the Company’s
    products, are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were
    $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $972 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make certain
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
    Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts in prior
    years’ financial statements and related notes have been
    reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

The Company
    adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”) effective
    January 1, 2007. Among other things FIN 48 prescribes
    a “more-likely-than-not” threshold to the recognition
    and de-recognition of tax positions, provides guidance on the
    accounting for interest and penalties relating to tax positions
    and requires that the cumulative effect of applying the
    provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to
    the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate
    components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial
    position. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a
    $120 million reduction of the Company’s unrecognized
    tax benefits and related interest accrual and has been reflected
    as an increase in the opening balance of Retained earnings of
    $27 million and Additional paid-in capital of
    $93 million as of January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of
    FIN 48, the Company also reclassified unrecognized tax
    benefits of $877 million from Deferred income taxes to
    Other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”).
    SFAS 158 has certain recognition and disclosure
    requirements which the Company adopted as of December 31,
    2006. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires employers to measure
    defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of
    the statement of financial position. The measurement date
    provision of SFAS 158 only affects the Company’s

non-U.S. pension

plans. The Company adopted the measurement date provisions for
    its

Non-U.S. pension

plans as of December 31, 2007. Upon adoption of the
    measurement provisions, the Company recorded $17 million,
    net of $2 million of taxes, as a decrease in the opening
    balance of Retained earnings at January 1, 2007 in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.



In September 2006, the FASB issued

EITF 06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-4”).

EITF 06-4

requires that endorsement split-dollar life insurance
    arrangements which provide a benefit to an employee beyond the
    postretirement period be recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 106, “Employer’s Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” or APB Opinion
    No. 12, “Omnibus Opinion—1967” (“the
    Statements”) based on the substance of the agreement with
    the employee. Under the provisions of these Statements, a
    liability should be accrued equal to the actuarial present value
    of the future death benefit over the service period.

EITF 06-4

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007. The Company will adopt

EITF 06-4

as of January 1, 2008 and anticipates that the adoption of
    this pronouncement will result in an increase in Other
    liabilities of approximately $50 million with the offset
    reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment to Retained earnings.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value as required by other accounting
    pronouncements and expands fair value measurement disclosures.
    SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. In February of 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position 157-2 which delays the effective date of
    SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities which are
    not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least
    annually) until fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS 157 on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and
    losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected
    will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting
    date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing
    the impact of SFAS 159 on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes new
    standards for the accounting for and reporting of
    non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and for
    the loss of control of partially owned and consolidated
    subsidiaries. SFAS 160 does not change the criteria for
    consolidating a partially owned entity. SFAS 160 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be applied
    prospectively upon adoption except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively.
    The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 will
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised
    2007) (“SFAS 141R”), a revision of SFAS 141,
    “Business Combinations.” SFAS 141R establishes
    requirements for the recognition and measurement of acquired
    assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non-controlling interests.
    SFAS 141R also provides disclosure requirements related to
    business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R
    will be applied prospectively to business combinations with an
    acquisition date on or after the effective date.

2. Discontinued
    Operations

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of its automotive
    electronics business to Continental AG for $856 million in
    net cash received. The Company recorded a gain on sale of
    business of $399 million before income taxes, which is
    included in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of
    tax, in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

On December 2, 2004, the Company completed the separation
    and spin-off of Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale
    Semiconductor”). Under the terms of the Master Separation
    and Distribution Agreement entered into between Motorola and
    Freescale Semiconductor, Freescale Semiconductor has agreed to
    indemnify Motorola for substantially all past, present and
    future liabilities associated with the semiconductor business.
    The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend
    to Motorola stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by
    $2.5 billion. The equity distribution was structured to be
    tax-free to Motorola stockholders for U.S. tax purposes
    (other than with respect to any cash received in lieu of
    fractional shares).

The financial results of the automotive electronics business and
    Freescale Semiconductor were reflected as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated financial statements and related
    notes thereto. During 2007, the discontinued operations activity
    primarily relates to resolutions of certain matters with the tax
    authorities and payments of post-retiree medical claims to
    former employees.



The following table displays summarized financial information

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded a $75 million reduction in the available-for-sale
    securities held in the Sigma Fund, reflecting a decline in the
    fair value of the securities. As of December 31, 2007,
    $57 million of this reduction represents a broad-based
    temporary decline in market value of various securities
    primarily due to credit spreads widening in several debt market
    segments, with the offsetting reduction reflected in Non-owners
    changes to equity. The Company believes credit market spreads
    will return to normal levels in the future. Additionally, due to
    the high credit ratings of the underlying securities, it is
    probable that the Company will be able to collect all amounts
    according to the contractual terms of the corporate bonds where
    fair values are less than their cost as of December 31, 2007. It
    is for these reasons that the unrealized losses on these
    corporate bonds are considered temporary. If it becomes probable
    that the Company will not collect all amounts in accordance with
    the contractual terms of a corporate bond, the Company considers
    the decline other-than-temporary. The remaining $18 million
    reduction in available-for-sale securities held by the Sigma
    Fund represents an other-than-temporary decline and has been
    reflected as an investment impairment.

As of December 31, 2007, there is an unrealized loss of
    $79 million associated with common stock and equivalents,
    of which $75 million is attributable to one equity security
    with a fair value of $228 million as of December 31,
    2007. Based on positive analyst coverage surrounding this equity
    security and the ability for strong growth, the Company believes
    the security will recover to its cost basis. Additionally, the
    Company has both the ability and intent to hold the common stock
    and equivalents until recovery. Accordingly, the unrealized loss
    is considered temporary.

The Company recorded investment impairment charges of
    $62 million, $27 million and $25 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    These impairment charges represent other-than-temporary declines
    in the value of the Company’s Sigma Fund and investment
    portfolios. Investment impairment charges are included in Other
    within Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations.

In 2007, the $50 million of net gains was primarily related
    to a $34 million gain on the sale of the Company’s
    embedded communication computing business.

In 2006, the $41 million of net gains was primarily related
    to a $141 million gain on the sale of the Company’s
    remaining shares in Telus Corporation, partially offset by a
    $126 million loss on the sale of the Company’s
    remaining shares in Sprint Nextel Corporation (“Sprint
    Nextel”).



During the first half of 2005, the Company sold
    22.5 million shares of common stock of Nextel
    Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”). The Company received
    approximately $679 million in cash and realized a pre-tax
    gain of $609 million from these sales.

On August 12, 2005, Sprint Corporation completed its merger
    (the “Sprint Nextel Merger”) with Nextel. In
    connection with the Sprint Nextel Merger, Motorola received
    $46 million in cash, 31.7 million voting shares and
    37.6 million non-voting shares of Sprint Nextel, in
    exchange for its remaining 54.7 million shares of Nextel.
    As a result of this transaction, the Company realized a gain of
    $1.3 billion, comprised of a $1.7 billion gain recognized
    on the receipt of cash and the 69.3 million shares of
    Sprint Nextel in exchange for its shares of Nextel, net of a
    $418 million loss recognized on its hedge of
    25 million shares of common stock of Nextel.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company elected to settle
    variable share purchase agreements by delivering
    30.3 million shares of Sprint Nextel common stock, with a
    value of $725 million, to the counterparties and selling
    the remaining 1.4 million Sprint Nextel common shares in
    the open market. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of
    $391 million and realized a loss of $70 million in
    connection with the settlement and sale.

On December 14, 2004, in connection with the announcement
    of the definitive agreement relating to the Sprint Nextel
    Merger, Motorola, a Motorola subsidiary and Nextel entered into
    an agreement pursuant to which Motorola and its subsidiary
    agreed to not dispose of their 29.7 million non-voting
    shares of Nextel (which became 37.6 million shares of
    non-voting common stock of Sprint Nextel issued in exchange for
    Nextel non-voting common stock pursuant to the Sprint Nextel
    Merger) for a period of no longer than two years. In exchange
    for this agreement, Nextel paid Motorola a fee of
    $50 million in 2005.

In November 2007, the Company repaid, at maturity, the
    entire $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding
    of its 4.608% Notes due November 16, 2007.

In November 2007, the Company issued an aggregate face principal
    amount of: (i) $400 million of 5.375% Senior
    Notes due November 15, 2012, (ii) $400 million of
    6.00% Senior Notes due November 15, 2017, and
    (iii) $600 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due
    November 15, 2037.

In January 2007, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire
    $118 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
    7.6% Notes due January 1, 2007.

In September 2005, the Company repurchased an aggregate
    principal amount of $1.0 billion of its outstanding
    long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of
    $1.1 billion through cash tender offers. Included in the
    $1.0 billion of long-term debt repurchased were repurchases
    of a principal amount of: (i) $86 million of the
    $200 million of 6.50% Notes due 2008 outstanding,
    (ii) $241 million of the $325 million of
    5.80% Notes due 2008 outstanding, and
    (iii) $673 million of the $1.2 billion of
    7.625% Notes due 2010 outstanding. In addition, the Company
    terminated a notional amount of $1.0 billion of
    fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps associated with the debt
    repurchased, resulting in an expense of approximately
    $22 million. The aggregate charge for the repurchase of the
    debt and the termination of the associated interest rate swaps,
    as presented in Other income (expense) in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations, was $137 million.

In September 2005, the Company retired approximately
    $1 million of the $398 million of 6.5% Debentures
    due 2025 (the “2025 Debentures”) in connection with
    the holders of the debentures right to put their debentures back
    to the Company. The residual put options expired unexercised and
    the remaining $397 million of 2025 Debentures were
    reclassified to long-term debt.

Aggregate requirements for long-term debt maturities during the
    next five years are as follows:

2008—$198 million; 2009—$4 million;
    2010—$534 million; 2011—$607 million;
    2012—$409 million.

In December 2006, the Company signed a new five-year revolving
    domestic credit facility

(“5-Year

Credit Facility”) for $2.0 billion, replacing the
    $1.0 billion facility due to expire in May 2007. At
    December 31, 2007, the commitment fee assessed against the
    daily average amounts unused was 8.0 basis points.
    Important terms of the

5-Year

Credit Facility include a covenant relating to the ratio of
    total debt to EBITDA. The Company was in compliance with the
    terms of the

5-year

Credit Facility at December 31, 2007.

The Company’s current corporate credit ratings are
    “BBB” on rating watch negative by Fitch,
    “Baa1” with a review for possible downgrade by
    Moody’s, and “BBB” on credit watch negative by
    S&P. The Company has never borrowed under its domestic
    revolving credit facilities. The Company also has
    $2.3 billion of uncommitted

non-U.S. credit

facilities with interest rates on borrowings varying from
    country to country depending upon local market conditions. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s total domestic and

non-U.S. credit

facilities totaled $4.3 billion, of which $314 million
    was considered utilized.



5.

Risk
    Management

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall
    exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.
    The Company’s policy prohibits speculation in financial
    instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
    trading in currencies for which there are no underlying
    exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to
    intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
    are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be
    effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
    being hedged and are designated as a part of a hedging
    relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
    changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
    correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
    items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of
    the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
    is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments
    against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
    or investments based on the operating business units’
    assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts
    for some of the Company’s non-functional currency
    receivables and payables, which are primarily denominated in
    major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company
    uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency
    exposures. In addition, the Company enters into derivative
    contracts for some firm commitments and some forecasted
    transactions, which are designated as part of a hedging
    relationship if it is determined that the transaction qualifies
    for hedge accounting under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” A portion of the
    Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not traded
    in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent
    reasonably possible, through managing net asset positions,
    product pricing and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had net
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
    $3.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.
    Management believes that these financial instruments should not
    subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
    movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
    offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities
    and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the
    instruments, which are charged to Other within Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. The following table shows, in millions of
    U.S. dollars, the five largest net foreign exchange
    contract positions as of December 31, 2007 and the
    corresponding positions as of December 31, 2006:

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial
    instruments. The Company minimizes its credit risk on these
    transactions by only dealing with leading, creditworthy
    financial institutions and does not anticipate nonperformance.
    In addition, the contracts are distributed among several
    financial institutions, all of whom presently have investment
    grade credit ratings, thus minimizing credit risk concentration.

The Company recorded income of $0.6 million and
    $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, representing the ineffective portions of
    changes in the fair value of fair value hedge positions. The
    ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of foreign
    currency fair value hedge positions in 2007 was de minimis.
    These amounts are included in Other within Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. The above amounts include the change in the fair
    value of derivative contracts related to the changes in the
    difference between the spot price and the forward price. These
    amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness. Expense
    (income) related to fair value hedges that were discontinued for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are
    included in the amounts noted above.

The Company recorded income of $1 million, $13 million
    and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, representing the ineffective
    portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow



hedge positions. These amounts are included in Other within
    Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations. The above amounts include the change
    in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the changes
    in the difference between the spot price and the forward price.
    These amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness.
    Expense (income) related to cash flow hedges that were
    discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005 are included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, on
    a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $(16) million,
    $(98) million and $21 million, respectively, was
    reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations.

At December 31, 2007, the maximum term of derivative
    instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was one year.
    However, the weighted average duration of the Company’s
    derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
    five months.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2007, the Company’s short-term debt
    consisted primarily of $134 million of short-term foreign
    debt, priced at short-term interest rates. The Company has
    $4.2 billion of long-term debt, including the current
    portion of long-term debt, which is primarily priced at
    long-term, fixed interest rates.

In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
    debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
    to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
    fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
    payments. The following table displays these outstanding
    interest rate swaps at December 31, 2007:

2,124

The weighted average short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
    payments on each of the above interest rate swaps was 6.60% for
    the three months ended December 31, 2007. The fair value of
    the above interest rate swaps at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, was $36 million and
    $(47) million, respectively. Except as noted below, the
    Company had no outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps
    or options relating to debt instruments at December 31,
    2007 or December 31, 2006.

The Company designated the above interest rate swap agreements
    as part of fair value hedging relationships. As such, changes in
    the fair value of the hedging instrument, as well as the hedged
    debt are recognized in earnings, therefore adjusting the
    carrying amount of the debt. Interest expense on the debt is
    adjusted to include the payments made or received under such
    hedge agreements. In 2007, the Company recorded an expense of
    $2.3 million representing the ineffective portions of
    changes in the fair value of interest rate swap hedge positions.
    These amounts are included in Other within Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. In the event the underlying debt instrument matures
    or is redeemed or repurchased, the Company is likely to
    terminate the corresponding interest rate swap contracts.

Additionally, one of the Company’s European subsidiaries
    has outstanding interest rate agreements (“Interest
    Agreements”) relating to a Euro-denominated loan. The
    interest on the Euro-denominated loan is floating based on

3-month

EURIBOR plus a spread. The Interest Agreements change the
    characteristics of interest rate payments from short-term
    EURIBOR based variable payments to maximum fixed-rate payments.
    The Interest Agreements are not accounted for as a part of a
    hedging relationship and accordingly the changes in the fair
    value of the Interest Agreements are included in Other income
    (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. The weighted average fixed rate payments on these
    EURIBOR interest rate agreements was 6.71%.



The fair value of the Interest Agreements at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006 was $3 million and
    $1 million, respectively.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
    Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
    dealing with leading, creditworthy financial institutions and
    does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts
    are distributed among several financial institutions, all of
    whom presently have investment grade credit ratings, thus
    minimizing credit risk concentration.

Net
    Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any
    hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
    foreign operations.

Investments
    Hedge

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into a
    zero-cost collar derivative (the “Sprint Nextel
    Derivative”) to protect itself economically against price
    fluctuations in its 37.6 million shares of Sprint Nextel
    Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) non-voting common stock.
    During the second quarter of 2006, as a result of Sprint
    Nextel’s spin-off of Embarq Corporation through a dividend
    to Sprint Nextel shareholders, the Company received
    approximately 1.9 million shares of Embarq Corporation. The
    floor and ceiling prices of the Sprint Nextel Derivative were
    adjusted accordingly. The Sprint Nextel Derivative was not
    designated as a hedge under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Accordingly, to
    reflect the change in fair value of the Sprint Nextel
    Derivative, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, included in Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations. In December 2006, the Sprint Nextel Derivative
    was terminated and settled in cash and the 37.6 million
    shares of Sprint Nextel were converted to common shares and
    sold. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of
    approximately $820 million from the settlement of the
    Sprint Nextel Derivative and the subsequent sale of the
    37.6 million Sprint Nextel shares. The Company recognized a
    loss of $126 million in connection with the sale of the
    remaining shares of Sprint Nextel common stock. As described
    above, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million in
    connection with the Sprint Nextel Derivative.

Prior to the merger of Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”)
    and Nextel Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”), the
    Company had entered into variable share forward purchase
    agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) to hedge its
    Nextel common stock. The Company did not designate the Variable
    Forwards as a hedge of the Sprint Nextel shares received as a
    result of the merger. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    $51 million of gains for the year ended December 31,
    2005 reflecting the change in value of the Variable Forwards.
    The Variable Forwards were settled during the fourth quarter of
    2005.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
    equivalents, Sigma Fund investments, short-term investments,
    accounts receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts
    payable, accrued liabilities, derivatives and other financing
    commitments. The Company’s Sigma Fund and investment
    portfolios and derivatives are recorded in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at fair value. All other financial
    instruments, with the exception of long-term debt, are carried
    at cost, which is not materially different than the
    instruments’ fair values.



Using quoted market prices and market interest rates, the
    Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at
    December 31, 2007 was $4.2 billion, compared to a
    carrying value of $4.2 billion. Since considerable judgment
    is required in interpreting market information, the fair value
    of the long-term debt is not necessarily indicative of the
    amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.

Deferred tax charges (benefits) that were recorded within
    Non-owner changes to equity in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets resulted from fair value adjustments to
    available-for-sale securities, net unrealized losses on
    securities, net gains (losses) on derivative instruments and
    retirement benefit adjustments. The adjustments were
    $306 million, $(182) million and $(753) million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Except for certain earnings that the Company
    intends to reinvest indefinitely, provisions have been made for
    the estimated U.S. federal income taxes applicable to
    undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Undistributed earnings that the Company intends to reinvest
    indefinitely, and for which no U.S. federal income taxes
    have been provided, aggregate $4.1 billion,
    $4.0 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The portion of earnings not
    reinvested indefinitely may be distributed without an additional
    U.S. federal income tax charge given the U.S. federal
    tax accrued on undistributed earnings and the utilization of
    available foreign tax credits.



Differences between income tax expense (benefit) computed at the

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (“the Act”) was signed into law. The Act provides for
    a special one-time tax incentive for U.S. multinationals to
    repatriate accumulated earnings from their foreign subsidiaries
    by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for
    certain qualifying dividends. The Company repatriated
    approximately $4.6 billion of accumulated earnings under
    the Act and recorded an associated tax benefit of
    $265 million in 2005. The Company finalized certain actions
    maximizing the tax benefit attributable to the repatriation of
    foreign earnings under the provisions of the Act and recognized
    an additional $68 million of net tax benefits relating to
    these actions during 2006.

Gross deferred tax assets were $8.9 billion and
    $8.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances,
    were $8.4 billion and $8.0 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross deferred
    tax liabilities were $4.1 billion and $5.0 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had valuation
    allowances of $515 million and $740 million,
    respectively, against its deferred tax assets, including
    $310 million and $523 million, respectively, relating
    to deferred tax assets for

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The net change in the total valuation allowance was a decrease
    of $225 million and $156 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, primarily attributable to: (i) the reversal
    of valuation reserves in Germany, UK and Israel based on
    additional positive evidence supporting a conclusion that the
    Company would more likely than not be able to utilize the tax
    carryforwards and deferred tax assets in the



future, and (ii) reversals of valuation reserves recorded
    as an offset to Non-owner changes to equity and Goodwill in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The valuation allowances relate primarily to tax carryforwards,
    including tax carryforwards of acquired businesses which have
    limitations upon their use, state tax carryforwards with short
    expiration periods and future capital losses related to certain
    investments. Additionally, $37 million of valuation
    reserves relate to deferred tax assets established in connection
    with acquisitions which, if reversed, would be a reduction in
    goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. The Company
    believes that the remaining deferred tax assets are more likely
    than not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable
    income and the implementation of tax planning strategies.

The Company adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The
    adoption resulted in a $120 million reduction of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits and related interest
    accrual and has been reflected as an increase in the opening
    balance of Retained earnings of $27 million and Additional
    paid-in capital of $93 million as of January 1, 2007.
    Upon the adoption of FIN 48, the Company also reclassified
    unrecognized tax benefits of $877 million from Deferred
    income tax to Other liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets.

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, including those
    attributable to discontinued operations, is as follows:

    $590 million, net of federal tax benefits, that if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

At December 31, 2007 the Company had $86 million and
    $10 million accrued for interest and penalties,
    respectively, on unrecognized tax benefits.

The Company is currently contesting significant tax adjustments
    related to transfer pricing for the 1996 through 2003 tax years
    at the appellate level of the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”). The Company disagrees with all of these
    proposed transfer pricing-related adjustments and intends to
    vigorously dispute them through applicable IRS and judicial
    procedures, as appropriate. However, if the IRS were to
    ultimately prevail on these matters, it could result in:
    (i) additional taxable income for the years 1996 through
    2000 of approximately $1.4 billion, which could result in
    additional income tax liability for the Company of approximately
    $500 million, and (ii) additional taxable income for
    the years 2001 and 2002 of approximately $800 million,
    which could result in additional income tax liability for the
    Company of approximately $300 million. The IRS is currently
    reviewing a claim for additional research tax credits for the
    years

1996-2003.

The IRS is conducting its field examination of the
    Company’s 2004 and 2005 tax returns. Although the final
    resolution of these matters is uncertain, based on current
    information, in the opinion of the Company’s management,
    the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However,
    an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect
    on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity
    or results of operations in the periods in which the matter is
    ultimately resolved. It is reasonably possible that within the
    next 12 months, these disputes will be resolved and such
    resolution may have a significant impact upon the amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits related to these issues.

The Company has several other

non-U.S. income

tax audits pending and while the final resolution is uncertain,
    in the opinion of the Company’s management, the ultimate
    disposition of the audits will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or results of operations.

Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of
    the expiration of statute of limitations for specific
    jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related
    unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken regarding
    previously filed tax returns will differ from those recorded as
    liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007. The Company anticipates that it is
    reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, several
    of the audits may be finalized resulting in a reduction in
    unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $40 million.
    However, based on the number of tax years currently under audit
    by the relevant federal, state and foreign tax authorities, the
    status of these examinations, and the protocol of finalizing
    audits by the relevant tax authorities, which could include
    formal legal proceedings, it is not possible to estimate the
    impact of any other amounts of such changes, if any, to
    previously recorded uncertain tax positions.

Retirement
    Benefits

Pension
    Benefit Plans

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
    “Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
    became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
    is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
    Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
    eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. The Company
    also provides defined benefit plans which cover non-U.S.
    employees in certain jurisdictions principally the United
    Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Japan and Korea (the

“Non-U.S. Plans”).

Any other pension plans are not material to the Company either
    individually or in the aggregate.

The Company has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
    benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
    officers elected prior to December 31, 1999. The
    Officers’ Plan contains provisions for vesting and funding
    the



participants’ expected retirement benefits when the
    participants meet the minimum age and years of service
    requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the
    Officers’ Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option
    to remain in the Officers’ Plan or elect to have their
    benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective
    December 31, 1999, newly elected officers are not eligible
    to participate in the Officers’ Plan. Effective
    June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
    retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
    (“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits in
    excess of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code
    on the Regular Pension Plan. Elected officers covered under the
    Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
    buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective
    January 1, 2005, newly hired employees were not eligible to
    participate in the MSPP. Effective January 1, 2007,
    eligible compensation has been capped at the IRS limit plus
    $175,000 or, for those in excess of this cap at January 1,
    2007, the eligible compensation used to compute the
    employee’s MSPP benefit is the greater of: (i) the
    employee’s frozen January 1, 2007 eligible
    compensation amount, or (ii) the earnings cap for the given
    year.

In February 2007, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan
    and the MSPP, modifying the definition of average earnings. For
    the years ended prior to December 31, 2007, benefits were
    calculated using the rolling average of the highest annual
    earnings in any five years within the previous ten calendar year
    period. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit calculation will
    be based on the set of the five highest years of earnings within
    the ten calendar years prior to December 31, 2007, averaged
    with earnings from each year after 2007. Also, effective January
    2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, modifying
    the vesting period from five years to three years.

The funded status of the Company’s

Non-U.S. pension

plans reflects the change in measurement date from October to
    December 31 in connection with the adoption of
    SFAS 158 in 2007. This change required the Company to
    obtain a cost projection of fifteen months, which covered the
    period of October 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 as well
    as the fiscal year 2007. The costs pertaining to the period
    October 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 were treated as a
    direct charge to opening retained earnings. The statement of
    stockholders’ equity reflects a decrease in retained
    earnings of $17 million, net of taxes of $2 million,
    as of January 1, 2007.

It is estimated that the net periodic cost for 2008 will include
    amortization of the unrecognized net loss and prior service
    costs for the Regular Plan, Officers’ and MSPP Plans,
    and

Non-U.S.

Plans, currently included in

Non-owner

changes to equity, of $23 million, $3 million, and
    $2 million, respectively.

The Company uses a five-year, market-related asset value method
    of amortizing asset-related gains and losses. Prior service
    costs are being amortized over periods ranging from 11 to
    12 years. Benefits under all pension plans are valued based
    upon the projected unit credit cost method.

Certain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the
    long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for net periodic cost and benefit
    obligation. The assumed discount rates reflect the prevailing
    market rates of a large universe of high-quality, non-callable,
    corporate bonds currently available that, if the obligation were
    settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary
    future cash



flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. The long-term
    rates of return on plan assets represents an estimate of
    long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a
    mixture of equities, fixed income, cash and other investments
    similar to the actual investment mix. In determining the
    long-term return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term
    rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and
    forecasted) in which the Company expects the plan funds to be
    invested.

The Company has adopted a pension investment policy designed to
    meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets
    assumption. To achieve this, the pension plans retain
    professional investment managers that invest plan assets in
    equity and fixed income securities and cash. In addition, some
    plans invest in insurance contracts. The Company has the
    following target mixes for these asset classes, which are
    readjusted at least quarterly, when an asset class weighting
    deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the
    required return at a reasonable risk level as follows:

Postretirement
    Health Care Benefit Plan

Certain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic
    employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
    termination of employment (the “Postretirement Health Care
    Benefits Plan”). For eligible employees hired prior to
    January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
    postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
    January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefit
    Plan has been closed to new participants. The benefit obligation
    and plan assets for the Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan
    have been measured as of December 31, 2007.

2013-2017


The health care trend rate used to determine the
    December 31, 2007 accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation is 9% for 2008. Beyond 2008, the rate is assumed to
    decrease by 1% per year until it reaches 5% by 2012 and then
    remains flat. The health care trend rate used to determine the
    December 31, 2006 accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation was 10%.

Changing the health care trend rate by one percentage point
    would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
    and the net retiree health care expense as follows:

The Company maintains a lifetime cap on postretirement health
    care costs, which reduces the liability duration of the plan. A
    result of this lower duration is a decreased sensitivity to a
    change in the discount rate trend assumption with respect to the
    liability and related expense.

The Company has no significant postretirement health care
    benefit plans outside the United States.

Defined
    Contribution Plan

The Company and certain subsidiaries have various defined
    contribution plans, in which all eligible employees participate.
    In the U.S., the 401(k) plan is a contributory plan. Matching
    contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’
    contributions. Effective January 1, 2005, newly hired
    employees have a higher maximum matching contribution at 4% on
    the first 5% of employee contributions, compared to 3% on the
    first 6% of employee contributions for employees hired prior to
    January 2005. The Company’s expenses, primarily relating to
    the employer match, for all defined contribution plans, for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $116
    million, $105 million and $105 million, respectively.

Share-Based
    Compensation Plans and Other Incentive Plans

Stock
    Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company grants options to acquire shares of common stock to
    certain employees, non-employee directors and to existing option
    holders in connection with the merging of option plans following
    an acquisition. Each option granted has an exercise price of
    100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
    the grant. Most option awards have a contractual life of ten
    years and vest over four years. Upon the occurrence of a change
    in control, each stock option outstanding on the date on which
    the change in control occurs will immediately become exercisable
    in full.



The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to
    purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through
    payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible compensation on an
    after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than
    $25,000 of stock in any calendar year. The price an employee
    pays per share is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
    the Company’s stock on the close of the first trading day
    or last trading day of the purchase period. The plan has two
    purchase periods, the first one from October 1 through March 31
    and the second one from April 1 through September 30. For
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, employees
    purchased 10.2 million, 8.3 million and
    11.9 million shares, respectively, at purchase prices of
    $14.93 and $15.02, $19.07 and $19.82, and $12.66 and $12.72,
    respectively.

Compensation expense for the Company’s employee stock
    options and employee stock purchase plans was as follows:

The Company calculates the value of each employee stock option,
    estimated on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The weighted-average estimated fair value of
    employee stock options granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $5.95, $9.23, and $5.75, respectively, using the following
    weighted-average assumptions:

In 2006, the Company began using the implied volatility for
    traded options on the Company’s stock as the expected
    volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. Prior
    to 2006, the Company used a blended volatility rate using a
    combination of historical stock price volatility and
    market-implied volatility for purposes of its pro forma
    information. The selection of the implied volatility approach
    was based upon the availability of actively traded options on
    the Company’s stock and the Company’s assessment that
    implied volatility is more representative of future stock price
    trends than historical volatility.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the average
    daily closing rates during the year for U.S. treasury notes
    that have a life which approximates the expected life of the
    option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the
    Company’s historical and future expectation of dividend
    payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents
    the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to
    remain outstanding.

The Company has applied a forfeiture rate, estimated based on
    historical data, of 25% to the option fair value calculated by
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This estimated
    forfeiture rate may be revised in subsequent periods if actual
    forfeitures differ from this estimate. Prior to 2006, the
    Company used the actual forfeiture method, which assumed that
    all options would vest with the pro forma expense adjusted
    when options were forfeited prior to the vesting dates.

    forfeitures, related to stock option plans and the employee
    stock purchase plan that will be recognized over the weighted
    average period of approximately two years. Cash received from
    stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan was
    $440 million, $918 million and $1.2 billion for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $177 million, $568 million and $571 million,
    respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options
    outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2007 was

    a December 31, 2007 stock price of $16.04 per share.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, 88.0 million shares and

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock (“RS”) and restricted stock unit
    (“RSU”) grants consist of shares or the rights to
    shares of the Company’s common stock which are awarded to
    employees and non-employee directors. The grants are restricted
    such that they are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and
    to restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the employee.
    Upon the occurrence of a change in control, the restrictions on
    all shares of RS and RSUs outstanding on the date on which the
    change in control occurs will lapse.

    aggregate of approximately 7.8 million, 2.8 million
    and 1.7 million shares of restricted stock and restricted
    stock units were granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    The amortization of unrecognized compensation for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $39 million, $24 million and $14 million,
    respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock and

Prior to adopting SFAS 123R, the Company presented all tax
    benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as
    operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash
    flows. As a result, $210 million of excess tax benefits for
    2005 has been classified as an operating cash inflow.
    SFAS 123R requires cash flows resulting from excess tax
    benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing
    activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from
    tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred
    tax asset attributable to stock



compensation costs for such options. As a result of adopting
    SFAS 123R, $50 million and $165 million of excess
    tax benefits for the years 2007 and 2006, respectively, have
    been classified as a financing cash inflow.

Motorola
    Incentive Plan

The Motorola Incentive Plan provides eligible employees with an
    annual payment, calculated as a percentage of an employee’s
    eligible earnings, in the year after the close of the current
    calendar year if specified business goals are met. The
    provisions for awards under these incentive plans for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    $190 million, $268 million and $548 million,
    respectively.

Mid-Range
    Incentive Plan

The Mid-Range Incentive Plan (“MRIP”) rewarded
    participating elected officers for the Company’s
    achievement of specified business goals during the period, based
    on two performance objectives measured over two-year cycles. The
    provision for MRIP for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
    $19 million. As of December 31, 2005, the MRIP was
    canceled.

Long-Range
    Incentive Plan

In 2005, a Long-Range Incentive Plan (“LRIP”) was
    introduced to replace MRIP. LRIP rewards participating elected
    officers for the Company’s achievement of specified
    business goals during the period, based on two performance
    objectives measured over three-year cycles. The provision for
    LRIP for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
    was $(8) million, $16 million and $15 million,
    respectively.

Current finance receivables are included in Accounts receivable
    and long-term finance receivables are included in Other assets
    in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Interest
    income recognized on finance receivables for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $7 million,
    $9 million and $7 million, respectively.

From time to time, the Company sells short-term receivables,
    long-term loans and lease receivables under sales-type leases
    (collectively, “finance receivables”) to third parties
    in transactions that qualify as “true-sales.” Certain
    of these finance receivables are sold to third parties on a
    one-time, non-recourse basis, while others are sold to third
    parties under committed facilities that involve contractual
    commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying
    receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
    facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be
    renewed on an annual basis. Certain sales may be made through
    separate legal entities that are also consolidated by the
    Company. The Company may or may not retain the obligation to
    service the sold finance receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2007, these committed
    facilities provided for up to $1.4 billion to be
    outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
    up to $1.3 billion provided at December 31, 2006 and
    up to $1.1 billion provided at December 31, 2005. As
    of December 31, 2007, $497 million of these committed
    facilities were utilized, compared to $817 million utilized
    at December 31, 2006 and $585 million utilized at
    December 31, 2005. Certain events could cause one of these
    facilities to terminate. In addition, before receivables can be
    sold under certain of the committed facilities, they may need to
    meet contractual requirements, such as credit quality or
    insurability.

Total finance receivables sold by the Company were
    $4.9 billion in 2007 (including $4.7 billion of
    short-term receivables), compared to $6.4 billion sold in
    2006 (including $6.2 billion of short-term receivables) and



$4.5 billion sold in 2005 (including $4.2 billion of
    short-term receivables). As of December 31, 2007, there
    were $978 million of receivables outstanding under these
    programs for which the Company retained servicing obligations
    (including $587 million of short-term receivables),
    compared to $1.1 billion outstanding at December 31,
    2006 (including $789 million of short-term receivables) and
    $1.0 billion outstanding at December 31, 2005
    (including $838 million of short-term receivables).

Under certain receivables programs, the value of the receivables
    sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from independent
    insurance companies, less deductibles or self-insurance
    requirements under the policies (with the Company retaining
    credit exposure for the remaining portion). The Company’s
    total credit exposure to outstanding short-term receivables that
    have been sold was $23 million at December 31, 2007 as
    compared to $19 million at December 31, 2006. Reserves
    of $1 and $4 million was recorded for potential losses on
    sold receivables at both December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively.

Certain purchasers of the Company’s infrastructure
    equipment continue to request that suppliers provide financing
    in connection with equipment purchases. These requests may
    include all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment.
    Periodically, the Company makes commitments to provide financing
    to purchasers in connection with the sale of equipment. However,
    the Company’s obligation to provide financing is often
    conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of
    the Company by a reputable bank to support the purchaser’s
    credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to
    purchase the receivable from the Company. The Company had
    outstanding commitments to extend

long-term

credit to third parties totaling $610 million at
    December 31, 2007, compared to $398 million at
    December 31, 2006. Of these amounts, $454 million was
    supported by letters of credit or by bank commitments to
    purchase receivables at December 31, 2007, compared to
    $262 million at December 31, 2006.

In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment
    customers, the Company also assists customers in obtaining
    financing directly from banks and other sources to fund
    equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide
    financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling
    $42 million and $122 million at December 31, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, respectively (including
    $23 million and $19 million at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term
    receivables). Customer financing guarantees outstanding were
    $3 million and $47 million at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively (including $0 million and
    $2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables).

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

The Company owns most of its major facilities and leases certain
    office, factory and warehouse space, land, and information
    technology and other equipment under principally non-cancelable
    operating leases. Rental expense, net of sublease income, for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $231
    million, $241 million and $250 million, respectively.
    At December 31, 2007, future minimum lease obligations, net
    of minimum sublease rentals, for the next five years and beyond
    are as follows: 2008—$355 million; 2009—$268 million;
    2010—$253 million; 2011—$169 million; 2012—$162
    million; beyond—$212 million.

Legal

Iridium Program:

The Company has been named as
    one of several defendants in putative class action securities
    lawsuits arising out of alleged misrepresentations or omissions
    regarding the Iridium satellite communications business which,
    on March 15, 2001, were consolidated in the federal
    district court in the District of Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications, Inc., et al.,

originally filed on April 22, 1999. Plaintiffs’
    motion for class certification was granted on January 9,
    2006 and the trial is scheduled to begin on May 22, 2008.

The Company was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
    Creditors of Iridium (the “Committee”) in the United
    States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
    (the “Iridium Bankruptcy Court”) on July 19,
    2001.

In re Iridium Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserts claims for breach of contract, warranty and
    fiduciary duty and fraudulent transfer and preferences, and
    seeks in excess of $4 billion in damages. On
    September 20, 2007, following a trial on the solvency and
    capital adequacy portion of the Committee’s fraudulent
    transfer and preference claims, the Iridium Bankruptcy Court
    granted judgment for Motorola on all those claims. The remaining
    claims for breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty and
    equitable subordination remain pending.



The Company has not reserved for any potential liability that
    may arise as a result of the litigation described above related
    to the Iridium program. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of
    these cases could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
    results of operations.

Telsim Class Action Securities:

In April
    2007, the Company entered into a settlement agreement in regards
    to

In re Motorola Securities Litigation

, a class action
    lawsuit relating to the Company’s disclosure of its
    relationship with Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
    Pursuant to the settlement, Motorola paid $190 million to
    the class and all claims against Motorola by the class have been
    dismissed and released.

In the first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a charge of
    $190 million for the legal settlement, partially offset by
    $75 million of estimated insurance recoveries, of which
    $50 million had been tendered by certain insurance
    carriers. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company
    commenced actions against the non-tendering insurance carriers.
    In response to these actions, each insurance carrier who has
    responded denied coverage citing various policy provisions. As a
    result of this denial of coverage and related actions, the
    Company recorded a reserve of $25 million in the second
    quarter of 2007 against the receivable from insurance carriers.

Other:

The Company is a defendant in various
    other suits, claims and investigations that arise in the normal
    course of business. In the opinion of management, and other than
    as discussed above with respect to the Iridium cases, the
    ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, liquidity or results of operations.

Other

The Company is also a party to a variety of agreements pursuant
    to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with
    respect to certain matters. Some of these obligations arise as a
    result of divestitures of the Company’s assets or
    businesses and require the Company to hold the other party
    harmless against losses arising from the settlement of these
    pending obligations. The total amount of indemnification under
    these types of provisions is $193 million, which the
    Company accrued $123 million as of December 31, 2007
    for potential claims under these provisions.

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses
    that result from the breach of general warranties contained in
    certain commercial, intellectual property and divestiture
    agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant
    payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant
    claims asserted against the Company. However, there is an
    increasing risk in relation to patent indemnities given the
    current legal climate.

In all indemnification cases, payment by the Company is
    conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
    procedures specified in the particular contract, which
    procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other
    party’s claims. Further, the Company’s obligations
    under these agreements for indemnification based on breach of
    representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of
    duration, typically not more than 24 months, and for
    amounts not in excess of the contract value, and in some
    instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties
    for certain payments made by the Company.

The Company’s operating results are dependent upon our
    ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality
    materials, parts and components to meet the demands of our
    customers. Furthermore, certain of our components are available
    only from a single source or limited sources. Even where
    alternative sources of supply are available, qualification of
    the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies
    could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which may
    have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $277
    million charge for a legal settlement with Freescale
    Semiconductor.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

Effective August 1, 2006 (the “Termination
    Date”), the Company terminated its shareholder rights plan.
    The shareholder rights plan was scheduled to expire in November
    2008. On the Termination Date, in connection with the
    termination of the shareholder rights plan, the Company made the
    filings necessary to eliminate all references to the
    Company’s Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
    Series B (“Series B”) from its Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation. Accordingly, no authorized
    Series B shares are reflected in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006. No Series B shares were or have been issued.

13.

Reorganization
    of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
    “Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
    eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
    and employment grade level in the event that employment is
    involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in-force

or restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in-force

has qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan.
    The Company recognizes termination benefits based on formulas
    per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future
    settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on
    estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved
    by management. Exit costs primarily consist of future minimum
    lease payments on vacated facilities. At each



reporting date, the Company evaluates its accruals for exit
    costs and employee separation costs to ensure the accruals are
    still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no
    longer required because of efficiencies in carrying out the
    plans or because employees previously identified for separation
    resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were
    redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original
    plans were initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the
    income statement line item where the original charges were
    recorded when it is determined they are no longer required.

    Charges

During 2007, the Company committed to implement various
    productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term,
    sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing
    operating costs. All three of the Company’s business
    segments, as well as corporate functions, are impacted by these
    plans. The majority of the employees affected are located in
    North America and Europe. The Company recorded net
    reorganization of business charges of $394 million,
    including $104 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $290 million of charges under Other charges (income) in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Included
    in the aggregate $394 million are charges of
    $401 million for employee separation costs,
    $42 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
    $19 million for exit costs, offset by reversals for
    accruals no longer needed.

Exit
    Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $54 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2007 additional charges of $19 million
    are primarily related to the exit of certain activities and
    leased facilities in Ireland by the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment. The 2007 adjustments of $2 million represent
    accruals for exit costs established through purchase accounting
    for businesses acquired. The $33 million used in 2007
    reflects cash payments. The remaining accrual of
    $42 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007, represents future cash payments for
    lease termination obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $104 million for employee separation costs, representing
    the severance costs for approximately 2,300 employees. The
    2007 additional charges of $401 million represent



severance costs for approximately 6,700 employees, of which
    2,400 were direct employees and 4,300 were indirect employees.

The adjustments of $64 million reflect $68 million of
    reversals of accruals no longer needed, partially offset by
    $4 million of accruals for severance plans established
    through purchase accounting for businesses acquired. The
    $68 million of reversals represent previously accrued costs
    for 1,100 employees, and primarily relates to a strategic change
    regarding a plant closure and specific employees previously
    identified for separation who resigned from the Company and did
    not receive severance or who were redeployed due to
    circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
    approved. The $4 million of accruals represents severance
    plans for approximately 200 employees established through
    purchase accounting for businesses acquired.

During 2007, approximately 5,300 employees, of which 1,700 were
    direct employees and 3,600 were indirect employees, were
    separated from the Company. The $248 million used in 2007
    reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
    remaining accrual of $193 million, which is included in
    Accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets at December 31, 2007, is expected to be paid to
    approximately 2,800 employees to be separated in 2008.

    Charges

During 2006, the Company committed to implement various
    productivity improvement plans aimed principally at:
    (i) reducing costs in its supply-chain activities,
    (ii) integration synergies, and (iii) reducing other
    operating expenses, primarily relating to engineering and
    development costs. The Company recorded net reorganization of
    business charges of $213 million, including
    $41 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $172 million of charges under Other charges in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Included in
    the aggregate $213 million are charges of $191 million
    for employee separation costs, $15 million for fixed asset
    impairment charges and $30 million for exit costs,
    partially offset by $23 million of reversals for accruals
    no longer needed. Total employees impacted by the actions
    committed to in 2006 were 3,900.

Exit
    Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $50 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2006 additional charges of $30 million
    were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segment. The 2006 adjustments of
    $7 million represent reversals of accruals no longer
    needed. The $19 million used in 2006 reflects cash payments
    to lessors. The remaining accrual of $54 million, which is
    included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006,
    represented future cash payments for lease termination
    obligations.



Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $53 million for employee separation costs, representing the
    severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees, of which
    1,100 were direct employees and 500 were indirect employees. The
    2006 additional charges of $191 million represented costs
    for an additional 3,900 employees, of which 1,700 were
    direct employees and 2,200 were indirect employees. The
    adjustments of $16 million represented reversals of
    accruals no longer needed.

During 2006, approximately 3,200 employees, of which 1,400
    were direct employees and 1,800 were indirect employees, were

    $7 million represented reversals of $1 million for
    accruals no longer needed and $6 million of translation
    adjustments. The $21 million used in 2005 reflected cash
    payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of $50 million,
    which was included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005,
    represented future cash payments for lease termination
    obligations.

Acquisitions
    and Related Intangibles

The Company accounts for acquisitions using purchase accounting
    with the results of operations for each acquiree included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for the period
    subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of
    these acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements were not significant individually nor in the
    aggregate.

The allocation of value to in-process research and development
    was determined using expected future cash flows discounted at
    average risk adjusted rates reflecting both technological and
    market risk as well as the time value of money. Historical
    pricing, margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used
    in the valuation of the in-process products. The in-process
    research and development acquired will have no alternative
    future uses if the products are not feasible.

The developmental products for the companies acquired have
    varying degrees of timing, technology, costs-to-complete and
    market risks throughout final development. If the products fail
    to become viable, the Company will unlikely be able to realize
    any value from the sale of incomplete technology to another
    party or through internal re-use. The risks of market acceptance
    for the products under development and potential reductions in
    projected sales volumes and related profits in the event of
    delayed market availability for any of the products exist.
    Efforts to complete all developmental products continue and
    there are no known delays to forecasted plans except as
    disclosed.

Item 9: Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A:
    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior
    management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered
    by this annual report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based
    on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the
    information relating to Motorola, including our consolidated
    subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is
    accumulated and communicated to Motorola’s management,
    including our chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Motorola’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our senior management, including our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, we assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007, using the criteria set forth in
    the

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is
    effective as of December 31, 2007. The Company’s
    independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP,
    has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of
    internal control over financial reporting appears in this

Form 10-K.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over
    financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2007 that have materially affected or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
    financial reporting.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We have audited Motorola, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Motorola,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A:
    Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Motorola, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
    as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
    ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated
    February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements.
