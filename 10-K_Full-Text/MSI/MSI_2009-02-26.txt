    60196.

Business
    Segments

We report financial results for the following three operating
    business segments:

Mobile
    Devices Segment

The Mobile Devices segment (“Mobile Devices” or the
    “segment”) designs, manufactures, sells and services
    wireless handsets with integrated software and accessory
    products, and licenses intellectual property. In 2008, the
    segment’s net sales represented 40% of the Company’s
    consolidated net sales.

Principal
    Products and Services

Our wireless subscriber products include wireless handsets and
    related software and accessory products. We also sell and
    license our intellectual property. We market our products
    globally to carriers and consumers through direct sales,
    distributors, retailers and, in certain markets, through
    licensees.



Our
    Industry

Total industry shipments of wireless handsets (also referred to
    as industry “sell-in”) increased to approximately
    1.2 billion units in 2008, a 5% increase compared to 2007.
    Demand from new subscribers was strong in emerging markets, led
    by India and China. During the second half of 2008, a global
    economic downturn impacted the wireless handset industry,
    resulting in the slowing of end-user demand.

The ongoing downturn in the global economy has many industry
    forecasters predicting a challenging 2009 for the wireless
    handset industry, with many predicting industry handset unit
    shipments to decline approximately 10% for the full year 2009
    compared to 2008. This would be the first decline in annual
    industry handset unit shipments since 2001. The expected decline
    would be a result of both slowing growth in the emerging markets
    and lower replacement sales in highly-penetrated markets.

Beyond 2009, we expect growth to return to the wireless handset
    industry. We believe growth rates will be in the mid single
    digits for the years 2010 and 2011, compared to the 15% CAGR
    experienced by the industry from 2004 through 2008. Although
    slowing, growth is expected to continue to be driven primarily
    by demand from new subscribers in emerging markets and
    replacement sales from the current subscriber base. As growth in
    the overall industry for mobile wireless handsets slows, we
    expect smartphones (devices that primarily have an open
    operating system and provide the opportunity to develop and run
    native applications) to be the fastest growing market segment.

Our
    Strategy

Motorola seeks to be a leading supplier of wireless handsets and
    mobile experiences to customers globally. To accomplish this
    objective, our strategy is focused on simplifying product
    platforms, enhancing our mid- and

high-tier

product portfolio, and strengthening our position in priority
    markets. We have taken significant actions in 2008 to simplify
    our wireless handset platforms and enhance our product
    portfolio, while reducing the size and cost structure of the
    Mobile Devices business. These actions will accelerate our speed
    to market with new products, allow us to offer richer consumer
    experiences and improve our financial performance.

Simplifying product platforms is an essential component of our
    overall strategy. We have reduced the number of product
    platforms that we support, increasing our emphasis on 3G and
    smartphone devices and maintaining our focus on CDMA and iDEN.
    We are implementing aggressive plans to rationalize both
    hardware and software platforms in order to reduce the
    complexity of our product platforms and system architectures.
    Our hardware platforms will leverage fewer chipset suppliers for
    our handsets. In addition, our software platforms will focus on
    Android (a Google-developed, royalty-free platform), Windows
    Mobile (a Microsoft platform) and P2K (a Motorola internal,
    proprietary platform). We will also continue to focus on our
    proprietary iDEN technology and the CDMA software platforms.
    CDMA and iDEN are technologies in which our segment has
    traditionally maintained a strong market share position. Success
    in these technologies also aligns with our focus on priority
    markets. These steps will provide Mobile Devices with the
    ability to streamline our portfolio, emphasizing product
    development and innovation, while also addressing the changing
    marketplace.

As the market evolves to reflect the emergence of converged
    wireless devices, mobile internet, social networking, navigation
    and messaging, the shift from “voice-centric” devices
    to “data-centric” devices is expected to continue.
    These devices, which include smartphones, deliver unique
    consumer experiences and require complete “end-to-end”
    solutions that incorporate various applications and services. By
    utilizing the smartphone platforms, we will provide a broad
    array of devices, targeted at delivering computer-like
    functionality, such as web browsing and email, in both our mid-
    and high-tier offerings. Over the next 12 to 18 months our
    primary smartphone development will be based on the Android
    operating system. As new generations of Windows Mobile enter the
    market, we intend to increase our focus on this platform as
    well. We will also leverage relationships with partners and
    developers in order to provide the necessary applications and
    services to support the “end-to-end” solutions desired
    by our consumers. We intend to utilize our experience with the
    Linux / Java platform and leverage our assets from
    previous Linux/Java investments, to deliver compelling
    applications and user experiences, such as more highly
    integrated social networking experiences.

In addition to our portfolio streamlining and enhancement
    efforts, over the next year we will also increase our focus in
    priority markets. These markets will include North America,
    Latin America and parts of Asia, including China. Historically,
    these are regions in which we have experienced strong market
    share and brand position. Additionally, these regions have
    represented a significant portion of the segment’s overall
    business. We will also continue to leverage our brand position
    in these markets. In other geographies, we will prioritize and
    make



investments commensurate with the competitiveness of our
    portfolio. Longer term, we plan to compete in all major markets.

Along with our mobile handset initiatives, we have also
    increased focus in our accessories portfolio to deliver complete
    mobile experiences and to complement the features and
    functionalities of wireless handsets. Expanding our accessory
    compatibility across all brands of wireless handsets and
    Bluetooth-enabled devices, as well as into spaces such as
    navigation, will provide greater opportunities for growth.

We continue to invest in next-generation technologies for
    wireless devices based on WiMAX, High-Speed Downlink Packet
    Access (“HSDPA”) and Long-Term Evolution
    (“LTE”). We believe a strong intellectual property
    portfolio is critical to our long-term success and to ensuring
    that we maintain a favorable strategic position that demonstrate
    unique experiences and value for consumers. In application
    services, we continue to work with third parties to improve upon
    and develop our services and applications, which will deliver
    rich experiences to the customer. Motorola is committed to
    investing in evolving technologies to ensure that we continue to
    deliver enhanced and differentiated wireless handset experiences
    to consumers.

Customers

The segment has several large customers located throughout the
    world. In 2008, aggregate net sales to the segment’s five
    largest customers represented approximately 41% of the
    segment’s net sales. The loss of one or more of these
    customers could have a material adverse effect on the
    segment’s business. In addition to selling directly to
    carriers and operators, our Mobile Devices business also sells
    products through a variety of third-party distributors and
    retailers, which account for approximately 24% of the
    segment’s net sales.

Uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions
    may cause, and in some cases has caused, our customers to
    maintain tighter inventory management. We experienced this
    beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and expect this trend to
    continue into 2009, which could impact the timing of future
    sales.

The U.S. market continued to be the segment’s largest
    individual market, accounting for approximately 44% of the
    segment’s net sales in 2008, compared to approximately 46%
    of the segment’s net sales in 2007. Approximately 56% of
    the segment’s net sales in 2008 were to markets outside the
    U.S., the largest of which were Brazil, China and Mexico.
    Compared to 2007, the segment experienced sales declines in each
    of its four major sales regions: North America, the Europe,
    Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region, Asia and Latin
    America.

Competition

The segment believes its overall market share for the full year
    2008 was approximately 8%, making it the fourth-largest
    worldwide supplier of wireless handsets on a full-year basis.
    For full year 2007, the segment’s overall market share was
    approximately 14%. We estimate our market share in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 to be approximately 6%, a decrease of
    approximately 6 percentage points versus the fourth quarter
    of 2007. The significant decrease was primarily driven by the
    segment’s limited product offerings in critical market
    segments, particularly 3G products, including smartphones,
    and very low-tier products.

The segment experiences intense competition in worldwide markets
    from numerous global competitors, such as Nokia, Samsung, LG and
    Sony-Ericsson. In 2008, the five largest handset manufacturers
    together held an aggregate market share of approximately 80%,
    compared to 83% at the end of 2007.

Smartphones emerged as a major product in the wireless handset
    market during 2008. Manufacturers with strong smartphone
    portfolios have benefited from this. Motorola is committed to
    enhancing its smartphone portfolio to compete more effectively
    and will focus on Android and Windows Mobile software platforms
    for these products, while also continuing to focus on our
    proprietary iDEN technology and the CDMA software platforms.

General competitive factors in the market for the segment’s
    products include: overall quality of user experience; design;
    time-to-market; brand awareness; technology offered; price;
    product features, performance, quality, delivery and warranty;
    the quality and availability of service; and relationships with
    key customers.

Payment
    Terms

The segment’s customers and distributors buy from us
    regularly with payment terms that are competitive with current
    industry practices. These terms vary globally and generally
    range from cash-with-order to 60 days.



Extended payment terms beyond 60 days are provided to
    certain customers on a limited basis. A customer’s
    outstanding credit at any point in time is limited to a
    predetermined amount as established by the Company.

Regulatory
    Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
    allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and
    other countries, and limited spectrum space is allocated to
    wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal
    communications industry may be affected if adequate frequencies
    are not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are not
    developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated
    for such use. Industry growth may also be affected by the cost
    of the new licenses required to use frequencies and any related
    frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
    new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
    offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
    systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as
    WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of
    their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other
    new technologies. In addition, Mobile WiMAX was approved in 2007
    as a global IMT (International Mobile Telecommunications)
    standard. This action lays the foundation to further expand
    mobile WiMAX in key bands, making additional spectrum available
    globally. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new
    opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)
    conducted its auction of 700 MHz band spectrum licenses in
    the United States. This spectrum can carry large amounts of data
    across long distances and penetrate walls easier than higher
    frequencies, enhancing in-building coverage. The spectrum is
    being recovered from television broadcast use as a result of the
    transition from analog to digital television. The spectrum was
    expected to be fully available for mobile operations as of
    February 17, 2009, however the date of the transition from
    analog to digital has been moved to June 12, 2009. This
    delay is not expected to significantly delay the deployment of
    services. However, any additional delays may have a greater
    impact on service deployment. The FCC has imposed open-access
    conditions that prevent the licensee from blocking devices or
    applications that are compatible with the network on
    approximately one-third of the 700 MHz spectrum that was
    auctioned. These conditions are intended to help foster
    innovation in handsets and applications. However, the actual
    impact of the new licenses remains unclear.

In January 2009, China’s Ministry of Industry and
    Information Technology issued licenses for its 3G mobile
    data network to the three key operators in China. With the
    Company’s focus on 3G products and smartphones and its
    focus on China as a high-priority market, we believe that we
    will benefit from the 3G transition in China.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $290 million at
    December 31, 2008, compared to $647 million at
    December 31, 2007. This decrease in backlog is primarily
    due to a decline in customer demand, driven by the
    segment’s limited product portfolio, as well as the global
    economic downturn. The 2008 backlog is believed to be generally
    firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be recognized as
    revenue in 2009. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of
    such orders is subject to future events that may cause the
    amount recognized to change.

Intellectual
    Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
    operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
    relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing
    processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third
    parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Motorola is
    also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty
    and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
    terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
    subject to licenses. The protection of these licenses is also
    important to the segment’s operations. Reference is made to
    the material under the heading “Other Information” for
    additional information relating to patents and trademarks and
    research and development activities with respect to this segment.

Inventory,
    Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
    inventory in manufacturing and distribution centers in order to
    meet customer delivery requirements in a manner consistent with
    industry standards. At the end of



2008, the segment had a lower inventory balance than at the end
    of 2007. The decrease reflects the continued decline in sales
    volumes during 2008.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
    is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
    demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
    currently source certain materials and components from single
    vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
    have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If
    certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or
    insolvent as a result of the ongoing global financial crisis, it
    could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an
    increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact the
    segment’s financial results.

Natural gas, electricity, and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
    primary sources of energy required for the segment’s
    manufacturing operations. Each of these resources are currently
    in generally adequate supply for the segment’s operations.
    In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and freight
    costs are dependent on world oil prices, which fluctuated
    significantly during 2008 and impacted our manufacturing and
    shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable
    proximity to the segment’s manufacturing facilities.
    However, difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned
    items or a significant cost increase could affect the
    segment’s results.

The segment permits returns under limited circumstances to
    remain competitive with current industry practices.

The segment typically experiences higher sales in the fourth
    calendar quarter and lower sales in the first calendar quarter
    of each year due to seasonal trends in the wireless handset
    industry.

Our
    Facilities/Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Libertyville, Illinois. Our
    other major facilities are located in Plantation, Florida;
    Beijing, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Tianjin, China; Seoul, South
    Korea; Chennai, India; and Jaguariuna, Brazil.

We also use several electronics manufacturing suppliers
    (“EMS”) and original design manufacturers
    (“ODM”) to enhance our ability to lower our costs

and/or

deliver products that meet consumer demands in the
    rapidly-changing technological environment. A significant
    portion of our handsets are manufactured either completely or
    substantially by non-affiliated EMS and ODM manufacturers,
    primarily by two third-party manufacturers in China.

In 2008, our handsets were primarily manufactured in Asia and
    Brazil, and we expect this to continue in 2009. Our largest
    manufacturing facilities are located in China and Brazil. Each
    of these facilities serves multiple countries and regions of the
    world.

Home
    and Networks Mobility Segment

The Home and Networks Mobility segment (“Home and Networks
    Mobility” or the “segment”) designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) digital
    video, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and broadcast
    network interactive set-tops (“digital entertainment
    devices”), end-to-end video delivery systems, broadband
    access infrastructure platforms, and associated data and voice
    customer premise equipment (“broadband gateways”) to
    cable television and telecom service providers (collectively,
    referred to as the “home business”), and
    (ii) wireless access systems (“wireless
    networks”), including cellular infrastructure systems and
    wireless broadband systems, to wireless service providers
    (collectively, referred to as the “networks
    business”). In 2008, the segment’s net sales
    represented 33% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Principal
    Products and Services

In the home business, the segment is a leading provider of
    end-to-end networks used for the delivery of video, data and
    voice services over hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”)
    networks, digital subscriber line (“DSL”) networks and
    passive optical networks (“PON”). Our portfolio
    includes: MPEG video encoding equipment for standard-definition
    and high-definition television (“HDTV” or
    “HD”); video processing and multiplexing systems; and

video-on-demand,

switched digital video and conditional access systems used by
    network operators and programmers to deliver video programming.
    We provide a broad array of digital entertainment devices
    supporting analog, digital and IP video delivery, including HD
    and digital video recording (“DVR”) (together,
    “HD/DVR”) applications. We support the delivery of
    high-speed data and voice services with head-end and central
    office



equipment, along with data and voice modems and gateways for HFC
    and DSL networks and optical line and optical node terminals for
    PON networks.

In the networks business, the segment provides end-to-end
    cellular networks, including radio base stations, base station
    controllers, associated software and services, application
    platforms and third-party switching for CDMA, GSM,
    iDEN

®

and UMTS technologies. The segment also offers a portfolio of
    WiMAX products and is in trials with customers to provide our
    LTE technology to enable next-generation mobile IP broadband
    access. WiMAX and LTE will make mobile bandwidth more affordable
    and accessible for mainstream consumer adoption.

Our products are marketed primarily to cable television
    operators, telecom operators, wireless service providers,
    television programmers and other communications providers
    worldwide and are sold primarily by our internal sales force.

Our
    Industry

The home market is evolving rapidly as cable and telecom network
    operators expand their video, data and voice services (commonly
    known as the “triple play”) to grow their subscriber
    base. The competition between cable and telecom service
    providers continues to increase. Telecom operators are expanding
    their broadband networks and beginning to offer advanced video
    and data services using IPTV and PON technologies. Cable
    operators are responding by expanding their investment in HD
    programming, bundling voice-over-IP services, expanding their
    broadband data service through Data Over Cable Service Interface
    Specifications (“DOCSIS”) 3.0 channel bonding, and
    maximizing utilization of network bandwidth using switched
    digital video technology.

Our home business is subject to regulation by the FCC in the
    United States and other governmental communication regulators
    throughout the world. FCC regulations requiring separation of
    security functionality from cable set-tops became effective in
    2007. This has resulted in increased competition for sales of
    set-top boxes to cable operators and has enabled a retail
    distribution of devices capable of accessing encrypted cable
    programming. Our home business offers a cablecard that allows
    third-party consumer electronic devices to be deployed on a
    network using the Motorola conditional access system. Motorola
    also offers a portfolio of cable card host set-tops that allows
    our digital video set-tops to be deployed in service provider
    networks using third-party encryption technology.

In the wireless networks market, the majority of installed
    cellular infrastructure systems are based on CDMA, GSM, UMTS and
    iDEN technologies. We supply systems based on each of these
    technologies and are the sole supplier of proprietary iDEN
    networks. Advanced infrastructure systems based on these
    technologies include GPRS, CDMA-1X and EDGE. In addition, some
    segments of the cellular infrastructure industry have installed,
    or are in the process of migrating to, 3G networks, which are
    high-capacity radio access wireless networks providing enhanced
    data services, improved Internet access and increased voice
    capacity. The primary 3G technologies are

W-CDMA

(based on either UMTS or Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access
    (“FOMA”) technologies) and CDMA 2000 1xEVDO. We
    supply 3G systems based on UMTS and CDMA 2000 1xEVDO
    technologies. An additional 3G technology standard, TD-SCDMA,
    has been driven primarily by the Chinese government and local
    Chinese vendors. China’s Ministry of Industry and
    Information Technology awarded 3G licenses in early 2009, which
    is driving regional network upgrades.

Industry standards bodies are in the process of defining the
    next generation of wireless broadband systems after 3G. The
    Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    (“IEEE”) has developed fixed and mobile broadband
    standards (802.16d and 802.16e) based on orthogonal frequency
    division multiplexing (“OFDM”) technology, which will
    utilize wider channels and enable triple play services (voice,
    data, video). These standards are the basis for WiMAX, a market
    that experienced strong growth in 2008. Motorola has been
    awarded a number of WiMAX contracts and customers in various
    markets have started to offer commercial WiMAX services
    utilizing Motorola infrastructure equipment. We are an early
    leader in WiMAX technology.

The International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) has
    also adopted next-generation cellular wireless access standards
    (“4G”) for the cellular infrastructure industry, also
    based on OFDM technology and known commonly as LTE. LTE has
    widespread industry support, not only from current GSM and UMTS
    operators, but also from CDMA/EV-DO based carriers.

Licensing bodies of governments around the world are making
    spectrum available for advanced wireless technologies, including
    4G, in recognition of growing demand for wireless broadband
    services. Currently, Motorola estimates that there are over
    1,200 licenses available worldwide for advanced wireless
    technologies with over 800 licenses outside of North America.



Demand for our products depends primarily on capital spending by
    providers of cellular and broadband services for constructing,
    rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems, as well as
    the marketing of advanced communications services by those
    providers. The amount of spending by these providers, and
    therefore a majority of our sales and profitability, are
    affected by a variety of factors, including: (i) the
    continuing trend of consolidation within the cable, wireline and
    wireless industries, (ii) the financial condition of
    operators and alternative providers, including their access to
    financing, (iii) technological developments,
    (iv) standardization efforts that impact the deployment of
    new equipment, (v) new legislation and regulations
    affecting the equipment sold by the segment, and
    (vi) general economic conditions.

During 2008, wireless operators’ expenditures globally for
    2G technology and related services, such as GSM, GPRS and EDGE,
    were comparable to 2007, while similar expenditures for iDEN
    technology were down. Global expenditures for 3G technology and
    related services, such as UMTS, increased in 2008, while similar
    expenditures for CDMA/EV-DO technology were comparable to 2007.
    Global expenditures for next-generation technologies, such as
    WiMAX, and related services increased in 2008.

Forecasted industry trends point to an overall decline in
    operator expenditures globally in 2009, as growth in UMTS and
    WiMAX are not expected to offset the decline in expenditures for
    legacy technologies, such as GSM and CDMA. Motorola expects the
    overall wireless network market to be down in 2009 compared to
    2008.

In 2008, the home business benefited from continued spending by
    operators on our products due to the increase in the number of
    video and data subscribers and the deployment of advanced video
    platforms by cable operators for

HD/DVR

applications, as well as from spending by telecom operators
    upgrading their networks and adding video services. The growth
    of broadband connectivity is expected to continue as cable
    operators upgrade to DOCSIS 3.0 and telecom service providers
    continue to deploy very high speed digital subscriber line
    (“VDSL”) and PON data services. While continued growth
    is expected in these video and data markets, industry analysts
    have been reducing their outlooks for capital spending due to
    the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy.

Our
    Strategy

The Home and Networks Mobility segment is focused on leadership
    in next-generation broadband solutions to accelerate the
    delivery of personal media experiences. Key elements in the
    segment’s strategy include: (i) providing for seamless
    convergence of services and applications across delivery
    platforms within the home and across wireline and wireless
    networks, (ii) innovating and optimizing our end-to-end
    network portfolio, and (iii) developing new services that
    leverage our platforms to provide revenue generating
    applications and services to our operator customers while
    enabling consumers to experience media mobility. As part of our
    strategy, we have made and will continue to make strategic
    acquisitions.

In the home business, we are focused on accelerating the rate of
    digital penetration by broadband operators in North America
    through an enhanced suite of digital entertainment devices.
    These products include basic models supporting the industry
    movement to all-digital delivery and advanced units supporting
    HD/DVR functions, as well as whole home video networking. We
    continue to invest to differentiate our products and services
    and add value for our customers in areas of software and
    applications, content on-demand and targeted advertising.

We are capitalizing on telecom operators decisions to offer IPTV
    to their subscribers globally, with products that support
    delivery of video content using both copper-outside-plant and
    fiber-to-the-premises (“FTTP”) networks. The segment
    continues to provide video infrastructure, FTTP access network
    equipment, advanced digital entertainment devices and IP
    interactive set-tops to leading telecommunication companies
    around the world. During 2008, we completed the acquisition of
    the set-top box and associated chipset assets of Zhejung Dahua
    Digital Technology Co., LTD and Hangzhou Image Silicon, known
    collectively as Dahua Digital to increase our position in the
    rapidly growing cable market in China. We are also an industry
    leader in broadband data and voice products. We are delivering
    DOCSIS 3.0 channel bonding on our cable modem termination
    systems (“CMTS”) and cable modems, and commercially
    deploying our Gigabit PON platform.

In the networks business, the segment provides equipment and
    services to over 125 GSM, CDMA, and iDEN networks globally. The
    segment is investing to be a leader in next-generation wireless
    broadband technologies with its WiMAX and LTE systems. WiMAX and
    LTE are evolved wireless broadband technologies that enable
    operators to provide improved data performance at lower
    operating cost. These technologies offer similar advantages for
    existing operators and emerging broadband service providers and
    vary in selection depending on the desired application and
    available spectrum. In 2008, the segment delivered WiMAX network
    equipment to over 25 WiMAX networks throughout the world. In
    addition, at the end of 2008, the segment was participating in
    over



20 WiMAX trials globally, representing new business
    opportunities in 2009. As a leader in the baseline OFDM
    technology used for WiMAX, the segment is leveraging this
    expertise to accelerate our LTE product offering which will
    support both frequency division duplex (“FDD”) and
    time division duplex (“TDD”) modes. The LTE standard
    was ratified in December 2008, enabling operators and vendors to
    accelerate testing and deployment. The segment is participating
    in the LTE system architecture evolution trial initiative.

Customers

In 2008, aggregate net sales to the segment’s five largest
    customers, primarily large cable operators and telecommunication
    companies located throughout the world, represented
    approximately 45% of the segment’s net sales. The loss of
    any of the segment’s large customers could have a material
    adverse effect on the segment’s business. Further, because
    many of the segment’s contracts are long-term, the loss of
    a major customer could impact revenue and earnings over several
    quarters. The segment’s proportion of sales outside of
    North America increased to 50% in 2008, compared to 48% in 2007.
    This reflected 5% aggregate growth in net sales outside of North
    America and a 3% decline in net sales in North America.

Competition

The businesses in which the segment operates are highly
    competitive. The rapid technological changes occurring in each
    of the markets in which the segment competes are expected to
    lead to the entry of many new competitors. Competitive factors
    in the market for the segment’s products and systems
    include: technology offered; product and system performance;
    price; product features; quality; delivery and availability. We
    believe that we are competitively positioned because of our
    solid relationships with major communication system operators
    worldwide, our technological leadership and our new product
    development capabilities. Price is a major area of competition
    and often impacts margins for initial system bids, particularly
    in emerging markets. Time-to-market has also been an important
    competitive factor, especially for new systems and technologies.
    We compete with many equipment suppliers and several consumer
    electronics companies located throughout the world.

In our home business, we compete worldwide in the market for
    digital entertainment devices and cable and wireline
    infrastructure equipment for broadband networks. Our largest
    competitor is Cisco. Based on 2008 annual sales, we are the
    leading provider of digital cable and IPTV set-tops worldwide.
    Our digital entertainment devices and infrastructure equipment
    compete with products from a number of different companies,
    including: (i) those that develop and sell products that
    are distributed by direct broadcast satellite service providers
    through retail channels, (ii) those that develop,
    manufacture and sell products of their own design, and
    (iii) those that license technology from us or other
    competitors.

Traditionally, cable service providers have leased

set-tops

to
    their customers. FCC regulations requiring separation of
    security functionality from set-tops became effective in 2007.
    To meet this requirement, we provide security modules to cable
    operators for use with both our own and third-party set-tops, as
    well as in consumer products designed to accept them. The
    initial implementation limited consumer products to
    broadcast-delivered channels including premium services. A full
    two-way security interface specification that allows retail
    customers access to all programming available on the
    operator’s network without the need for a set-top box has
    been adopted by a few television manufacturers. They began
    shipping television sets that incorporate this capability in
    2008.

We also compete worldwide in the market for broadband data and
    voice products. We believe that we are a leading provider of
    cable modems worldwide, competing with several consumer
    electronic companies and original design manufacturers worldwide.

In the wireless networks market, there is widespread competition
    from numerous competitors, ranging from some of the world’s
    largest diversified companies to foreign telecommunications
    companies to many small, specialized firms. Ericsson is the
    market leader, followed by the Nokia-Siemens joint venture,
    Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and Motorola, along with other vendors
    with similar market share. We believe we are a leading provider
    of WiMAX technologies. Many of the major competitors who compete
    across various wireless technologies also compete in WiMAX.

The segment’s networks business is confronting several
    factors that could impact its business, including price
    competition, continuing consolidation among competitor
    telecommunications equipment providers, consolidation among
    customers, the potential impact of global economic conditions,
    and vendor financing by competitors as customers continue to
    look to vendors as an additional source of financing.



Payment
    Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement. In
    North America, payment is generally due 30 to 60 days from
    the invoice date. In regions outside of North America, terms
    vary widely but are typically limited to no more than 90 days.
    Contracts for wireless networks typically include implementation
    milestones, such as delivery, installation and system
    acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to
    complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on the completion
    of the milestone.

As required for competitive reasons, extended payment terms are
    provided to customers from time-to-time on a limited basis. The
    segment’s payment terms are consistent with industry
    practice, as many of our contracts are awarded through a
    competitive bid process. When required for competitive reasons,
    we may provide long-term financing in connection with equipment
    purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase
    price.

Regulatory
    Matters

Many of our products are subject to regulation by the FCC in the
    United States and other communications regulatory agencies
    around the world. In addition, our customers, and their networks
    into which our products are incorporated, are subject to
    government regulation. Government regulatory policies affecting
    either the willingness or the ability of cable and telecom
    operators, wireless operators and wireline operators to offer
    certain services, or the terms on which these operators offer
    the services and conduct their business, may have a material
    adverse effect on the segment’s results. Motorola has
    developed products using trunking and data communications
    technologies to enhance spectral efficiencies. The growth and
    results of the wireless communications industry may be affected
    by regulations impacting access to allocated spectrum for
    wireless communications users, especially in urban areas where
    the spectrum is heavily used.

Historically, reception of digital television programming from a
    cable broadband network has required a set-top with security
    technology. This security technology has limited the
    availability of set-tops to those manufactured by a few cable
    network manufacturers, including Motorola. FCC regulations
    requiring separation of security functionality from set-tops
    that are aimed at increasing competition and encouraging the
    sale of set-tops in the retail market became effective for most
    customers in 2007. Traditionally, cable service providers sold
    or leased their set-top to their customer. As the retail market
    develops for set-tops and televisions capable of accepting the
    security modules, sales of our set-tops which are sold to cable
    providers may be negatively impacted.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
    new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
    offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
    systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as
    WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of
    their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other
    technologies. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new
    opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

As more fully described under “Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions — Regulatory Matters”, as television
    transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to
    more efficient digital modes, various countries around the world
    are examining, and in some cases already pursuing, the
    redevelopment of portions of the television spectrum. Certain
    segments of the spectrum that have historically been utilized
    for analog television have now been designated to support new
    commercial communications systems and, therefore, are expected
    to generate new business opportunities for Motorola in wireless
    and video technologies. In the U.S., the FCC conducted an
    auction of spectrum for the 700 MHz band that is expected
    to be reclaimed by the government on June 12, 2009. License
    for this spectrum may be used for flexible fixed, mobile and
    broadcast applications. Although the auction winners will
    determine the best utilization of the acquired spectrum, both
    LTE and WiMAX are candidates for technology selection. In
    addition, a contiguous portion of this spectrum has generated
    interest for mobile TV applications.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $2.3 billion at
    December 31, 2008, compared to $2.6 billion at
    December 31, 2007. The 2008 order backlog is believed to be
    generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
    recognized as revenue during 2009. The forward-looking estimate
    of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that
    may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual
    Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
    operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
    relating to its products, systems, technologies and
    manufacturing processes.



The segment seeks to build upon our core enabling technologies,
    such as digital compression, encryption and conditional access
    systems, and wireless air-interface technology in order to lead
    worldwide growth in the market for wired and wireless
    communications networks. Our policy is to protect our
    proprietary position by, among other methods, filing
    U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology
    and improvements that we consider important to the development
    of our business. We also rely on our proprietary knowledge and
    ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our
    competitive position and will periodically seek to include our
    proprietary technologies in certain patent pools that support
    the implementation of standards. We are a founder of MPEG LA,
    the patent licensing authority established to foster broad
    deployment of MPEG-2-compliant systems, and we have recently
    joined the MPEG4-Visual patent pool as a licensor. In addition,
    we have licensed our digital conditional access technology,
    DigiCipher

®

II, to other equipment suppliers and continue our joint ventures
    with Comcast for development and licensing of conditional access
    technology.

We also enter into other license agreements, both as licensor
    and licensee, covering certain products and processes with
    various companies. These license agreements require the payment
    of certain royalties that are not expected to be material to the
    segment’s financial results. Royalty and licensing fees
    vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the
    agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to
    licenses. Reference is made to the material under the heading
    “Other Information” for information relating to
    patents, trademarks and research and development activities with
    respect to this segment.

Inventory,
    Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
    inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a
    manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2008,
    the segment had higher inventory balances than at the end of
    2007, primarily due to a change in manufacturing strategy to
    increase in-house manufacturing and reduce outsourced
    manufacturing by third-party providers.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
    is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
    demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
    currently procure certain materials and components from

single-source

vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
    have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If
    certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or
    insolvent as a result of the ongoing global financial crisis, it
    could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an
    increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact the
    segment’s financial results.

Natural gas, electricity, and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
    primary sources of energy required for our manufacturing
    operations. Each of these resources are currently in generally
    adequate supply for the segment’s operations. In addition,
    the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are
    dependent on world oil prices, which fluctuated significantly
    during 2008 and impacted our manufacturing and shipping costs.
    Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the
    segment’s manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties
    in obtaining any of the aforementioned items or a significant
    cost increase could affect the segment’s results.

Generally, we do not permit customers to return products, other
    than under standard warranty provisions. The segment has not
    experienced seasonal buying patterns for its products.

Our
    Facilities/Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. Our other
    major facilities are located in: Arlington Heights, Illinois;
    San Diego, California; Taipei, Taiwan; Bangalore, India; Beijing
    and Tianjin, China; and Reynosa, Mexico. In addition to our own
    manufacturing, we utilize non-affiliated electronics
    manufacturing suppliers and original design manufacturers,
    primarily in Asia, in order to enhance our ability to lower
    costs

and/or

deliver products that meet consumer demands.

Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions Segment

The Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment (“Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions” or the “segment”) designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and digital
    two-way radio, voice and data communications products and
    systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and
    end-to-end enterprise mobility systems for a wide range of
    enterprise markets, including government and public safety
    agencies (which, together with all sales to distributors of
    two-way communication products, is referred to as the
    “government and public safety market”), as well as
    retail, energy and utilities, transportation,
    manufacturing, healthcare and other commercial



customers (which, collectively, are referred to as the
    “commercial enterprise market”). In 2008, the
    segment’s net sales represented 27% of the Company’s
    consolidated net sales.

Principal
    Products and Services

We are the world’s leading provider of advanced
    mission-critical and commercial enterprise mobility networks,
    services, applications and devices. In the government and public
    safety market, Motorola offers an extensive portfolio of
    standard products and services that meet evolving public safety
    and security needs, including products based on both TETRA
    (terrestrial trunked radio) and APCO 25 (Association for Public
    Safety Communications Officials) standards, with nearly
    80 years of experience in this space. In the commercial
    enterprise market, our products and systems provide better
    information at the point of business activity, connect
    seamlessly, and present tools to control the mobile experience.
    Our products include: two-way radios, mobile computing products,
    advanced data capture products including barcode scanners and
    imagers, radio frequency identification (“RFID”)
    infrastructure, software management, security tools and wireless
    infrastructure.

The segment’s products and services are sold stand-alone or
    as an integrated solution through Motorola’s direct sales
    force and through independent and authorized distributors,
    dealers and value-added resellers, independent software vendors,
    original equipment manufacturers and service operators.
    Distributors and value-added resellers may provide a service or
    add components in order to resell our product to end users. The
    segment provides systems engineering, installation and other
    technical and systems management services to meet its customers
    particular needs. The customer may also choose to install and
    maintain the equipment with its own employees, or may obtain
    installation, service and parts from a network of the
    segment’s authorized service centers or from other
    non-Motorola service centers.

Our
    Industry

We compete in the mobile segment of the communications industry,
    providing wireless products and services to public safety,
    government and enterprise customers.

Within our government and public safety market, interoperability
    and natural disaster preparedness continue to be important
    issues for our customers worldwide. Our extensive portfolio of
    products includes integration services, equipment and support
    packages for both of the major standards-based private network
    technologies, APCO 25 and TETRA, as well as wireless broadband
    applications. As new and better spectrum utilization evolves, we
    expect to see more demand and greater potential for broadband
    solutions and data applications, such as video surveillance and
    other data-based products, in 2009 and beyond. While
    mission-critical communications and homeland security remain
    high priorities for our customers, we have seen reduced spending
    in the construction and manufacturing markets due to the global
    market conditions, and expect this to continue in 2009.

Within our commercial enterprise market, we believe there
    continues to be long-term opportunity for growth as the global
    workforce continues to become more mobile and the industries and
    markets that purchase our products continue to expand. The
    markets in which Motorola competes include mobile computing
    products and services, enterprise wireless infrastructure, bar
    code scanning, RFID products and services, and mobile network
    management platforms. Organizations looking to increase
    productivity and derive benefits from mobilizing their
    applications and workforces are driving adoption in this market.
    In 2009, given the current global economic conditions and
    customer capital expenditure constraints, we expect reduced
    spending in the commercial enterprise market.

Our
    Strategy

The segment’s strategy is to maintain our global leadership
    positions in the government and public safety and commercial
    enterprise markets through the continued delivery of mobile
    products and services and systems that meet our customers’
    demand for real-time information everywhere.

Our strategy in the government and public safety market is to
    enable our customers to focus on their missions, not the
    technology. This is accomplished by providing mission-critical
    systems, seamless connectivity through highly reliable voice and
    data networks and a suite of advanced applications that provide
    real-time information to end users. Key objectives in
    maintaining our leadership position include: (i) continuing
    investment in our analog radio portfolio while leading the
    ongoing migration to digital products, (ii) leveraging our
    wireless broadband portfolio to drive growth and enter new
    markets, (iii) managing the potential public/private
    convergence of



700MHz public safety systems in the U.S. and digital
    dividend spectrum worldwide, and (iv) continuing to lead
    the market in APCO 25 and TETRA standards-based voice and data
    networking systems around the world. We continue to actively
    manage our portfolio, investing to expand into attractive,
    complementary markets, and divesting non-strategic businesses.

In the commercial enterprise market, our approach is to deliver
    products and services that are designed to empower the mobile
    workforce to increase productivity, drive cost effectiveness,
    and promote faster execution of critical business processes. Our
    solutions architecture focuses on three areas:
    (i) portfolio of devices and applications that provide real
    time information at the point of business activity,
    (ii) enterprise wireless networks that allocate seamless
    connectivity inside and outside the enterprise, and (iii) a
    set of management, security and mobility tools that provide a
    controlled deployment of the enterprise mobility applications.

Customers

Our products and services are sold worldwide to a diverse set of
    customers, including government and public safety agencies
    (police, fire, and emergency management services) and
    militaries, as well as retail, utility, transportation and
    logistics, manufacturing, wholesale and distribution, healthcare
    and other commercial customers. Our sales model emphasizes both
    direct sales by our in-house sales force and indirect sales
    through our channel of value-added resellers and distributors.
    We believe this dual sales approach allows us to meet customer
    needs effectively, build strong, lasting relationships and
    broaden our penetration across various markets. Our channel
    sales force extends the reach of our products and services to
    meet demand in market segments where our direct sales force does
    not sell. Resellers and distributors each have their own sales
    organizations which complement and extend our sales
    organization. With deep expertise about specific customers’
    operations, resellers are very effective in promoting sales of
    the Company’s products. Our independent software vendor and
    value-added resale channels offer customized applications that
    meet specific needs in each market segment we serve.

Our largest customer is the U.S. Government, which
    represented approximately 8% of the segment’s net sales.
    The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect
    on the segment’s revenue and earnings over several
    quarters, because some of our contracts with the U.S. Government
    are long-term. Net sales to customers in North America
    represented 57% of the segment’s net sales in 2008.

A majority of our sales are made directly by our in-house sales
    force, and the remainder of our sales are made through global
    resellers and distributors. Given the current global economic
    conditions, we expect reduced spending by certain customers,
    particularly retail, transportation and logistics, construction
    and manufacturing, to continue into 2009.

Competition

The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive.
    Continued evolution in the industry, as well as technological
    migration, is opening up the market to increased competition.
    Other key competitive factors include: technology offered;
    price; availability of vendor financing; product and system
    performance; product features, quality, availability and
    warranty; the quality and availability of service; company
    reputation; relationship with key customers; and time-to-market.
    We believe we are uniquely positioned in the industry due to our
    strong customer relationships, our technological leadership and
    capabilities, and our comprehensive range of offerings.

The segment experiences widespread competition in the government
    and public safety market from a growing number of new and
    existing competitors, including large system integrators. In
    this market, the segment provides communications and information
    systems compliant with both APCO 25 and TETRA industry digital
    standards. Major competitors include: M/A-Com, EADS, Kenwood, EF
    Johnson and Cisco.

Large system integrators are seeking to move further into the
    public safety area, specifically in the federal government
    market. Competitors in this segment, including the Company, may
    also serve as subcontractors to large system integrators and are
    selected based on a number of competitive factors and customer
    requirements. Where favorable to the Company, we may partner
    with large system integrators to make available our portfolio of
    advanced mission-critical services, applications and devices.

Several other competitive factors may have an impact on the
    business, including: the consolidation among telecommunications
    equipment providers, evolving developments in the 700 MHz
    band, and increasing encroachment by broadband and IP solution
    providers and new low-tier entrants. As demand for
    fully-integrated



voice, data, and broadband systems continues, the segment may
    face additional competition from public telecommunications
    carriers.

Within the commercial enterprise market, many firms are engaged
    in the manufacturing and marketing of mobile computing devices,
    products in bar code reading equipment and wireless networks.
    Numerous companies, including present manufacturers of scanners,
    lasers, optical instruments, microprocessors, wireless networks,
    notebook computers, handheld devices and telephonic and other
    communication devices, have the technical potential to compete
    with the business. Competitors such as Intermec, Honeywell and
    Cisco deliver products in certain parts of the commercial
    enterprise market.

Payment
    Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement.
    Generally, contract payment terms range from 30 to 45 days
    from the invoice date within North America and are typically
    limited to 90 days in regions outside of North America. A
    portion of the contracts in the government and public safety
    market include implementation milestones, such as delivery,
    installation and system acceptance, which generally take 30 to
    180 days to complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent
    on completion of the milestone.

We generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required
    for competitive reasons, we may provide long-term financing in
    connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or
    a portion of the purchase price.

Regulatory
    Matters

The use of wireless voice, data and video communications systems
    requires radio spectrum, which is regulated by governmental
    agencies throughout the world. In the U.S., the FCC and the
    National Telecommunications and Information Administration
    (“NTIA”) regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities
    and federal entities, respectively. Similarly, countries around
    the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and
    implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum, pursuant to
    their respective national laws and international coordination
    under the International Telecommunications Union
    (“ITU”). Consequently, the business and results of
    this segment could be affected by the rules and regulations
    adopted by the FCC, NTIA or regulatory agencies in other
    countries from time to time. The availability of additional
    radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities.
    Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide
    opportunities or may require modifications to some of our
    products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.

The segment manufactures and markets products in spectrum bands
    already made available by regulatory bodies. These include voice
    and data infrastructure, mobile radios and portable or handheld
    units. Our products span the public safety, enterprise,
    commercial and consumer markets and operate both on licensed and
    unlicensed spectrum. In addition, new spectrum bands and
    modified regulations provide possible opportunities for new
    business.

As television transmission and reception technology transitions
    from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries
    around the world are examining, and in some cases already
    pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television
    spectrum. In the U.S., pursuant to federal legislation, analog
    television stations must cease operation in the broadcast
    television spectrum by June 12, 2009. As a result of this
    transition, 108 MHz of spectrum historically used for
    broadcast television is being redeveloped for new uses (the
    so-called “digital dividend” spectrum), including
    broadband and narrowband wireless communications. This
    soon-to-be available spectrum can provide new opportunities for
    Motorola and for our competitors. Under rules adopted by the
    FCC, this portion of the spectrum under redevelopment (the
    700 MHz band) will support new commercial and public safety
    communications systems. Licenses for the majority of this
    spectrum have already been issued and as of February 2009, over
    40 public safety customers are already implementing narrowband
    700 MHz systems in areas where television incumbency is not
    an issue. Additional agencies are expected to begin deploying
    systems once broadcast television is cleared from the
    700 MHz band in mid-2009. The FCC is also making provisions
    for a 700 MHz band nationwide public safety broadband
    network that may be built over the next

10-15 years.

Canada also released a consultation requesting industry input on
    making additional spectrum available for public safety use in
    the 700 MHz band. Segments of the spectrum have been
    auctioned for commercial use and Motorola could see new business
    opportunities as auction winners implement broadband systems on
    that spectrum. However, since many analog television operations
    will continue transmitting in this spectrum until June 12,
    2009, it is premature for auction winners to deploy in most
    markets. This delay may temporarily delay opportunities for the
    Company.



In addition to reallocating TV spectrum at 700 MHz for
    public safety and commercial use, in November 2008 the FCC
    issued a decision to open unused portions of the television
    spectrum below 700 MHz for unlicensed uses, including
    broadband. The amount and specific location in the TV band of
    this “whitespace” spectrum available varies by
    geographic location. Also, its use is governed by technical
    rules adopted to protect incumbent operations from interference.
    For example, the FCC decision relies on geolocation, a
    technology recommended by Motorola, to protect incumbent
    television stations. This decision to open the TV whitespace
    spectrum provides additional potential opportunities for
    wireless broadband systems. The FCC decision also advised that
    these initial TV whitespace rules are conservative with regard
    to protection of broadcast incumbents and that relaxation to
    provide greater TV whitespace opportunities may be possible once
    additional experience is gained.

Internationally, the ITU World Radio Conference held in Geneva
    in November 2007 identified spectrum that could be made
    available as part of a “digital dividend” as
    television transitions from analog to digital technology
    globally. Countries around the world are studying the potential
    size, timing and use of this potentially available spectrum. In
    November 2007, the European Commission issued a statement
    promoting a common European approach to its use. The United
    Kingdom has already decided to redevelop spectrum as a result of
    the digital transition and is making available 112 MHz of
    spectrum through auctions. Canada has released a consultation
    requesting industry input on making additional spectrum
    available for public safety use in the 700 MHz band. A
    number of other countries around the world have also indicated
    their intention to pursue the availability of digital dividend
    spectrum.

In addition, some of our operations use substances regulated
    under various federal, state, local and international laws
    governing the environment and worker health and safety,
    including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the
    ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous
    substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
    Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state,
    local and international laws governing chemical substances in
    electronic products.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $2.4 billion as of
    December 31, 2008, compared to $2.3 billion as of
    December 31, 2007. The 2008 order backlog is believed to be
    generally firm and approximately 70% of that amount is expected
    to be recognized as revenue during 2009. The forward-looking
    estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future
    events that may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual
    Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
    operations. The segment has an extensive U.S. and
    international portfolio of patents relating to its products,
    systems, technologies and manufacturing processes, including
    recent research developments in scanning, information
    collection, network communications and network management. We
    have also filed additional patent applications in the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as in foreign
    patent offices.

The segment licenses some of its patents to third parties and
    this revenue is not significant. Motorola is also licensed to
    use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees
    vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the
    agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses.

We actively participate in the development of open standards for
    interoperable, mission-critical digital two-way radio systems.
    We have published our technology and licensed patents to
    signatories of the industry’s two primary memorandums of
    understanding defined by the Telecommunications Industry
    Association (“TIA”), Project 25, and European
    Telecommunications Standards Institute (“ETSI”), TETRA.

Notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents and the
    resulting potential for increased competition for some of our
    products in the future, we believe that our extensive patent
    portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive
    advantage. Furthermore, we believe we are not dependent upon a
    single patent, or a few patents. Our success depends more upon
    our proprietary know-how, innovative skills, technical
    competence and marketing abilities. In addition, because of
    changing technology, our present intention is not to rely
    primarily on patents or other intellectual property rights to
    protect or establish our market position. However, the segment
    continues to litigate against competitors to enforce its
    intellectual property rights in certain technologies and is
    currently involved in several such lawsuits. Reference is made
    to the material under the heading “Other Information”
    for information relating to patents, trademarks and research and
    development activities with respect to this segment.



Inventory,
    Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
    inventory to meet customers’ delivery requirements in a
    manner consistent with industry standards. The segment provides
    custom products which requires the stocking of inventories and
    large varieties of piece parts and replacement parts in order to
    meet delivery and warranty requirements. To the extent
    suppliers’ product life cycles are shorter than the
    segment’s, stocking of lifetime buy inventories is required
    to meet long-term warranty and contractual requirements. In
    addition, replacement parts are stocked for delivery on customer
    demand within a short delivery cycle. At the end of 2008, the
    segment had a higher inventory balance than at the end of 2007,
    primarily as a result of the Company acquiring a controlling
    interest in Vertex Standard Co, Ltd., in January 2008.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
    is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
    demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
    currently procure certain materials and components from
    single-source vendors. A material disruption from a
    single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our
    results of operations. If certain key suppliers were to become
    capacity constrained or insolvent as a result of the ongoing
    global financial crisis, it could result in a reduction or
    interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies
    and adversely impact the segment’s financial results.

Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
    primary sources of energy for our manufacturing operations,
    which are currently in adequate supply. In addition, the cost to
    operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world
    oil prices, which fluctuated significantly during 2008 and
    impacted our manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is
    generally available in reasonable proximity to the
    segment’s manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties
    in obtaining any of these items or a significant cost increase
    could affect the segment’s results.

Generally, the segment’s contracts do not include a right
    of return, other than for standard warranty provisions. For new
    product introductions in our government and public safety
    market, we may enter into milestone contracts providing that the
    product could be returned if we do not achieve the milestones.
    Due to buying patterns in the markets we serve, sales tend to be
    somewhat higher in the fourth quarter.

Our
    Facilities/Manufacturing

Our primary offices are located in Schaumburg, Illinois and
    Holtsville, New York. Our other major facilities are located in:
    Penang, Malaysia; Reynosa, Mexico; Krakow, Poland; Berlin,
    Germany; and Arad, Israel. In addition to our own manufacturing,
    we utilize non-affiliated electronics manufacturing suppliers
    and distribution and logistics services providers in order to
    enhance our ability to lower costs and deliver products that
    meet consumer demands.

    Information

Financial Information About
    Segments.

    Item 1 incorporates by reference Note 12,
    “Information by Segment and Geographic Region,” of
    Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data of this document.

Customers.

Motorola has
    several large customers, the loss of one or more of which could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company. In 2008,
    aggregate net sales to the Company’s five largest customers
    represented approximately 25% of the Company’s sales. No
    single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
    Company’s net sales in 2008.

Approximately 2% of Motorola’s net sales in 2008 were to
    various branches and agencies, including the armed services, of
    the U.S. Government. All contracts with the
    U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the
    convenience of the Government.

Government contractors, including Motorola, are routinely
    subjected to numerous audits and investigations, which may be
    either civil or criminal in nature. The consequences of these
    audits and investigations may include administrative action to
    suspend business dealings with the contractor and to exclude it
    from receiving new business. In addition, Motorola, like other
    contractors, reviews aspects of its government contracting
    operations, and, where appropriate, takes corrective actions and
    makes voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Government. These
    audits and investigations could adversely affect Motorola’s
    ability to obtain new business from the U.S. Government.



Backlog.

Motorola’s
    aggregate backlog position for all Motorola segments, as of the
    end of the last two fiscal years was approximately as follows:

December 31, 2008

$

5.0 billion

December 31, 2007

$

5.5 billion

Except as previously discussed in this Item 1, the orders
    supporting the 2008 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table
    are believed to be generally firm, and approximately 90% of the
    backlog on hand at December 31, 2008 is expected to be
    recognized as revenue in 2009. The forward-looking estimate of
    the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may
    cause the amount recognized to change.

Research and
    Development.

Motorola’s business
    segments participate in very competitive industries with
    constant changes in technology. Throughout its history, Motorola
    has relied, and continues to rely, primarily on its research and
    development (“R&D”) programs for the development
    of new products, and on its production engineering capabilities
    for the improvement of existing products. Technical data and
    product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola’s
    business segments on a regular basis. Management believes,
    looking forward, that Motorola’s commitment to R&D
    programs should allow each of its segments to remain competitive.

R&D expenditures relating to new product development or
    product improvement were $4.1 billion in 2008, compared to
    $4.4 billion in 2007 and $4.1 billion in 2006.
    R&D expenditures decreased 7% in 2008 as compared to 2007,
    after increasing 8% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Motorola
    continues to believe that a strong commitment to research and
    development is required to drive long-term growth. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately 27,000 professional
    employees were engaged in such R&D activities.

Patents and
    Trademarks.

Motorola seeks to obtain patents
    and trademarks to protect our proprietary position whenever
    possible and practical. As of December 31, 2008, Motorola,
    Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries owned approximately 9,907
    utility and design patents in the U.S. and 12,793 patents in
    foreign countries. These foreign patents are mostly counterparts
    of Motorola’s U.S. patents, but a number result from
    research conducted outside the U.S. and are originally filed in
    the country of origin. During 2008, Motorola, Inc. and its
    wholly owned subsidiaries were granted 644 U.S. utility and
    design patents. Many of the patents owned by Motorola are used
    in its operations or licensed for use by others, and Motorola is
    licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and
    licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
    terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
    subject to licenses.

Environmental
    Quality.

During 2008, compliance with
    federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of
    materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
    protection of the environment, did not have a material effect on
    capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of
    Motorola.

Employees.

At
    December 31, 2008, there were approximately 64,000
    employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries, compared to
    66,000 employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

We wish to caution the reader that the following important
    risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this
    report or our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
    could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
    stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document
    and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of
    importance or probability of occurrence.

We have had substantial operating losses in 2008 and 2007 and
    may continue to incur losses as we reposition our Mobile Devices
    business.

In 2008 and 2007, Motorola had substantial operating losses as a
    result of the financial performance of our Mobile Devices
    business. While we have plans in place intended to improve the
    performance of this business, we cannot be certain that we will
    be successful or that we will be profitable in 2009.

The wireless mobile handset market experienced slowing growth
    in 2008 and the market is expected to decline in 2009 which
    could negatively impact transition plans for our Mobile Devices
    business.

In 2009, worldwide wireless handset industry unit shipments are
    expected to decline by approximately 10%. This would be the
    first annual decline in industry handset unit shipments since
    2001. A declining mobile handset market may make it more
    difficult to improve our business, due to excess manufacturing
    capacity, increased price competition and other market factors.

We have lost significant market share in our Mobile Devices
    businesses and such loss has negatively impacted our performance
    and may continue to negatively impact our financial results.

Our share of the worldwide wireless handset market has declined
    significantly in the last two years, from approximately 22% in
    2006, to 14% in 2007, to 8% in 2008. While we reduced our costs
    during this period of time, these market share declines and
    resulting volume reductions have had an adverse effect on our
    results of operations. If market share in our Mobile Devices
    business continues to decline, it will adversely impact our
    financial results.

The uncertainty of current economic and political conditions
    makes budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce demand
    for our products.

Current conditions in the domestic and world economies are very
    uncertain. The global financial crisis, as well as ongoing
    political conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, have
    created many economic and political uncertainties that have
    impacted worldwide markets. As a result, it is difficult to
    estimate changes in various parts of the world economy,
    including the markets in which we participate. Because all
    components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon
    estimates in the markets we serve and demand for our products,
    the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future
    income and expenditures difficult.

We have manufacturing operations and engineering resources in
    Israel that could be disrupted as a result of hostilities in the
    region. We also sell our products and services throughout the
    Middle East and demand for our products and services could be
    adversely impacted by hostilities in this region.

The potential for future terrorist attacks, increased global
    conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts and public
    health issues has created worldwide uncertainties that have
    negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact,
    demand for certain of our products.

We operate in highly competitive markets and our financial
    results will be affected if we are not able to compete
    effectively.

The markets for our products are highly competitive with respect
    to, among other factors: pricing, product features, product and
    service quality, and the time required to introduce new products
    and services. We are constantly exposed to the risk that our
    competitors may implement new technologies before we do, or may
    offer lower prices, additional products or services or other
    incentives that we cannot or will not offer. We can give no
    assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against
    existing or future competitors.

Our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new
    products and technologies and our results can be impacted by the
    effectiveness of our significant investments in new products and
    technologies.

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly
    changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, short
    product life cycles and evolving industry standards. We face
    intense competition in these



markets from both established companies and new entrants.
    Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive
    to develop and bring to market. Our success depends, in
    substantial part, on the timely and successful introduction of
    new products and upgrades of current products to comply with
    emerging industry standards and to address competing
    technological and product developments carried out by our
    competitors. The research and development of new,
    technologically-advanced products is a complex and uncertain
    process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as
    well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market
    trends. We may focus our resources on technologies that do not
    become widely accepted or are not commercially viable. In
    addition, our products may contain defects or errors that are
    detected only after deployment. If our products are not
    competitive or do not work properly, our business will suffer.

Our results are subject to risks related to our significant
    investment in developing and introducing new products, such as:
    advanced wireless handsets, including smartphones; WiMAX, LTE
    and other advanced technologies for wireless broadband networks;
    products for transmission of telephony and high-speed data over
    hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems; integrated digital radios;
    and integrated public safety systems. These risks include:
    (i) difficulties and delays in the development, production,
    testing and marketing of products; (ii) customer acceptance
    of products; (iii) the development of, approval and
    compliance with industry standards; (iv) the significant
    amount of resources we must devote to the development of new
    technology; and (v) the ability to differentiate our
    products and compete with other companies in the same markets.

We face a number of risks related to the ongoing financial
    crisis and severe tightening in the global credit markets.

The ongoing global financial crisis affecting the banking system
    and financial markets has resulted in a severe tightening in the
    worldwide credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many
    financial markets and extreme volatility in credit and equity
    markets. This financial crisis has impacted, and could continue
    to impact, Motorola’s business in a number of ways,
    including:

•

Potential Deferment or Cancellation of Purchases and Orders
    by Customers:

Uncertainty about current and
    future global economic conditions may cause, and in some cases
    has caused, consumers, businesses and governments to defer or
    cancel purchases in response to tighter credit, decreased cash
    availability and declining consumer confidence. If future demand
    for our products declines, it will adversely impact our
    financial results.

•

Customers’ Inability to Obtain Financing to Make
    Purchases from Motorola

and/or

Maintain Their Business:

Some of our customers
    require substantial financing in order to fund their operations
    and make purchases from Motorola. The inability of these
    customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of
    our products

and/or

meet
    their payment obligations to us could have, and in some cases
    has had, an adverse impact on our financial results. In
    addition, if the financial crisis results in insolvencies for
    our customers, it will adversely impact our financial results.

•

Increased Requests by Customers for Vendor Financing by
    Motorola:

Certain of the Company’s
    customers, particularly, but not limited to, those who purchase
    large infrastructure systems, request that their suppliers
    provide financing in connection with equipment purchases. In
    response to the recent tightening in the credit markets, these
    types of requests continue to increase in volume and scope.
    Motorola has increased its commitments to provide financing in
    light of these requests and a continuation of the current credit
    crisis could force Motorola to choose between further increasing
    its level of vendor financing or potentially losing sales to
    these customers.

Negative Impact from Increased Financial Pressures on
    Third-Party Dealers, Distributors and
    Retailers:

A number of our businesses make sales
    in certain regions through third-party dealers, distributors and
    retailers. Although many of these third parties have significant
    operations and maintain access to available credit, others are
    smaller and more likely to be impacted by the significant
    decrease in available credit that has resulted from the current
    financial crisis. If credit pressures or other financial
    difficulties result in insolvency for important third parties
    and Motorola is unable to successfully transition

end-customers

to purchase our products from other third parties or from us
    directly, it will adversely impact our financial results.

•

Negative Impact from Increased Financial Pressures on Key
    Suppliers:

Our ability to meet customers’
    demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and
    adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components
    from our suppliers. Certain of our components are available only
    from a single source or limited sources. If certain key
    suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent as a
    result of the financial crisis, it could result in a reduction
    or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of



supplies and adversely impact our financial results. In
    addition, credit constraints at key suppliers have resulted in
    accelerated payment of accounts payable by Motorola, impacting
    our cash flow. This trend could continue and may even
    accelerate, impacting our cash flow.

•

Increased Risk of Losses or Impairment Charges Related to
    Debt Securities and Equity and Other Investments Held by
    Motorola:

The current volatility in the financial
    markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that
    the actual amounts realized in the future on our debt and equity
    investments will differ significantly from the fair values
    currently assigned to them. In 2008, Motorola has recognized
    $186 million of impairment charges and $101 million of
    temporary unrealized losses on debt securities held in its Sigma
    Fund, a broadly diversified portfolio of highly rated,
    short-duration debt securities. There can be no assurance that
    the value of Sigma Fund investments will not decline further in
    the future.

Also, many of the Company’s equity investments are in
    early-stage technology companies and, therefore, may be
    particularly subject to substantial price volatility and
    heightened risk from the tightening in the credit markets.

•

Increased Risk of Financial Counterparty Failures Could
    Negatively Impact our Financial Position:

The
    Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall
    exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.
    The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to these financial
    instruments. In order to minimize this risk, the contracts are
    distributed among several leading financial institutions, all of
    whom presently have investment grade credit ratings. Although
    the Company has not experienced and does not anticipate
    nonperformance by its counterparties, in light of the ongoing
    threats to financial institutions from the global financial
    crisis, there can be no assurance of performance by the
    counterparties to these financial instruments.

•

Returns on Pension and Retirement Plan Assets and Interest
    Rate Changes Could Affect Our Earnings in Future
    Periods:

The funding position of our pension
    plans is impacted by the performance of the financial markets,
    particularly the equity markets, and the discount rates used to
    calculate our pension obligations for funding and expense
    purposes. Recent significant declines in the financial markets
    have negatively impacted the value of the assets in the
    Company’s pension plans. In addition, lower bond yields may
    reduce our discount rates resulting in increased pension
    contributions and expense.

Funding obligations are determined under government regulations
    and are measured each year based on the value of assets and
    liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not
    provide the long-term returns that are expected under the
    governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make
    larger contributions. The equity markets can be, and recently
    have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future
    contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively
    short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can
    impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate
    environment, the likelihood of higher contributions in the
    future increases.

•

Impact on Ability to Sell Receivables:

The
    Company sells accounts receivable and long-term receivables to
    third parties. Sales are made both on a one-time, non-recourse
    basis and under committed facilities that involve contractual
    commitments from third parties to purchase qualifying
    receivables up to monetary limits. These sales of receivables
    provide the Company the ability to accelerate cash flow when it
    is prudent to do so. The ability to sell (or “factor”)
    receivables, particularly under committed facilities, is often
    subject to the credit quality of the obligor and the
    Company’s ability to obtain sufficient levels of credit
    insurance from independent insurance companies. In early 2009, a
    $400 million committed facility expired and was not
    renewed. Although the Company is negotiating replacement
    facilities, there is no assurance that the Company will be able
    to implement these facilities. Reduction in the volume of
    committed receivable purchasing facilities could limit the
    Company’s ability to sell receivables in the future.
    Further, the severe tightening in the credit markets due to the
    ongoing global financial crisis could limit the Company’s
    ability to sell receivables in the future, particularly if the
    creditworthiness of our customers declines.

•

Impact on Ability to Purchase Sufficient Credit
    Insurance:

We purchase a large amount of credit
    insurance to mitigate some of our credit risks. In particular,
    our ability to sell receivables, particularly under committed
    receivables facilities, is often subject to obtaining sufficient
    levels of credit insurance from independent insurance companies.
    Accordingly, our ability to sell certain of our receivables, and
    therefore our cash flows, could be negatively impacted if we are
    not able to continue to purchase credit insurance in certain
    countries and in sufficient quantities. Although credit
    insurance remains generally available to the Company, it has
    become more expensive to obtain and often requires higher
    deductibles than in the past.



There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to
    obtain sufficient quantities of credit insurance in the
    necessary locations in the future.

We face a number of risks related to the recent downgrade of
    the Company’s long-term debt to non-investment grade by one
    credit rating agency:

In December, Standard and Poor’s downgraded the
    Company’s long-term debt to BB+ (one level below investment
    grade) from BBB and removed the short-term rating. In February
    2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded the Company’s long-term debt
    to BBB- from BBB and downgraded the short-term debt rating to
    F-3 from F-2. Also in February 2009, Moody’s Investor
    Service downgraded the Company’s long-term debt to Baa3
    from Baa2 and downgraded the short-term debt rating to P-3 from
    P-2. Since the Company has a non-investment grade rating from
    one rating agency, it is referred to as a “split rated
    credit”.

•

Our access to short-term borrowing in the commercial paper
    market is very limited:

While the Company did not
    issue commercial paper in 2008, if the Company needs access to
    very short-term borrowing, it may no longer be able to access
    the unsecured commercial paper market because of its

P-3/F-3

short-term

ratings. Other sources of short-term borrowing may be more
    limited, if available at all, and will have higher cost to
    borrow than the commercial paper market.

•

Our access to the long-term debt market may be
    limited:

As a split rated credit, our ability to
    issue long-term debt is more limited and the market into which
    split rated debt is offered can be very volatile and can be
    unavailable for periods of time. As a result, it may be more
    difficult for us to quickly issue long-term debt and any debt
    issued may be more costly. These factors may impact our
    operating flexibility.

•

Our ability to provide performance bonds, bid bonds, standby
    letters of credit and surety bonds could be severely
    limited:

Commercial contracts with
    Motorola’s customers often require performance bonds, bid
    bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds (collectively,
    referred to as “Performance Bonds”) to be issued on
    behalf of the Company by banks and insurance companies. As a
    split rated credit, issuers of these Performance Bonds may be
    less likely to provide Performance Bonds on the Company’s
    behalf in the future, unless the Company provides collateral.
    These limitations on issuance may apply to the renewal and
    extension of existing Performance Bonds, as well as the issuance
    of new Performance Bonds. Such collateral requirements could
    result in less liquidity for other operational needs. Also, as a
    result of the Company’s current credit ratings, there has
    been an increase in the cost of issuance of Performance Bonds.

•

Our ability to hedge foreign exchange risk could be severely
    limited:

As a split rated credit, counterparties
    may be unwilling to provide trading and derivative lines for the
    Company without cash collateral. This would severely limit our
    ability to reduce volatility in earnings and cash flow. Should
    cash collateral be provided, less liquidity would be available
    for operational needs.

•

Our ability to fund our foreign affiliates could be
    limited:

The Company relies on uncommitted lines
    of credit from banks to provide daylight overdraft, short-term
    loans and other sources of liquidity for foreign affiliates. As
    a split rated credit, lenders may be unwilling to provide credit
    to our foreign affiliates. This could result in the Company
    using U.S. cash to make loans to these affiliates or
    provide permanent equity where loans are not possible.

•

Trade terms with suppliers could become less
    favorable:

Given the Company’s split rating,
    suppliers may require letters of credit, cash collateral or
    other forms of security as part of standard payment conditions.
    This could result in reduced liquidity and less leverage in
    pricing negotiations.

•

Our ability to sell receivables could be
    impacted:

As a split rated credit, the conditions
    placed on us by the parties that we sell our receivables to will
    become more stringent. If we are unable, or choose not to, meet
    these new conditions, our ability to sell the receivables will
    be negatively impacted.

We may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility
    if we are not able to meet the conditions for borrowing required
    by our facility.

Our existing $2 billion five-year domestic syndicated
    revolving credit facility contains various conditions, covenants
    and representations with which we must be in compliance in order
    to borrow funds. Although there are no borrowings outstanding
    under the facility, if we wish to borrow under this facility in
    the future, there can be no assurance that we will be in
    compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations.



We may not generate sufficient future taxable income, which
    may require additional deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances.

If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable
    income in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, or if there
    is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the
    time period within which the underlying temporary differences
    become taxable or deductible, the Company could be required to
    increase its valuation allowances against its deferred tax
    assets resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and an
    adverse impact on future operating results.

We may be required to record additional goodwill or
    amortizable intangible assets impairment charges, which could
    result in an additional significant charge to earnings.

Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our
    amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least
    annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether
    goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a
    decline in the Company’s stock price or market
    capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows, and
    slower growth rates in our industry. During 2008, the Company
    recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1.6 billion and
    intangible assets impairment charges of $129 million. The
    goodwill impairment charges resulted from lower asset values in
    the overall market and the impact of the macroenvironment on the
    Company’s near-term forecasts. The intangible asset
    impairments resulted from a change in a technology platform
    strategy. Further declines in the Company’s stock price,
    the markets or reductions in the Company’s future cash flow
    estimates and future operating results may require the Company
    to record significant additional goodwill or intangible asset
    impairment charges in our financial statements in future
    periods, negatively impacting our financial results.

Our strategy to separate our businesses into two
    publicly-traded companies may have an adverse effect on business
    operations and our assets.

The Company has announced a strategy to separate into two
    publicly-traded companies in the future, if and when market and
    businesses conditions support a separation. There are various
    uncertainties and risks relating to the proposed separation of
    our businesses into two publicly-traded companies, which are
    enhanced because we have not announced a target date for the
    separation or determined the structure that will best serve the
    strategic realignment. The uncertainties and risks that could
    have an adverse effect on our business operations or assets
    include: (i) the distraction of management and disruption
    of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    operating results; (ii) perceived uncertainties as to our
    future direction may result in increased difficulties in
    recruiting and retaining employees, particularly highly
    qualified employees; (iii) perceived uncertainties as to
    our future direction may have a negative impact on our
    relationships with our customers, suppliers, vendors and
    partners and may result in the loss of business opportunities;
    (iv) the process of exploring strategic alternatives may be
    time consuming and expensive and may result in the loss of
    business opportunities; and (v) we may not be able to
    successfully achieve the benefits of any strategic alternative
    undertaken by us.

Our future financial results may be negatively impacted if we
    do not execute on our hardware and software strategy for our
    Mobile Devices business.

As part of our ongoing effort to improve the product portfolio
    of our Mobile Devices business, we are in the process of
    rationalizing our hardware and software platforms to reduce the
    complexity of our product platforms and system architecture to
    lower our cost to produce devices and to enable richer consumer
    experiences. Failure to execute these rationalization plans in a
    timely and effective manner may cause us to be competitively
    disadvantaged in many areas, including but not limited to, cost,
    time to market and the ability to

ramp-up

production in a timely fashion with acceptable quality and
    improved/additional features.

If our operating system strategy is not successful, our
    Mobile Devices business could be negatively impacted.

We have made a strategic decision to use third-party

and/or

open
    source operating systems, such as Google’s Android
    operating system and Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating
    system in our wireless products. As a result of this, we are at
    risk due to our dependency on third parties continued
    development of operating systems and third parties’
    software application ecosystem infrastructures. With respect to
    Google’s Android operating system which is a newer
    operating system for wireless handsets, in the event that
    Google’s Android team no longer develops the Android code
    base and this development is not taken up by the open source
    community, this would increase the burden of development on
    Motorola. From an overall risk perspective, the industry is
    currently engaged in an extremely competitive phase with respect
    to operating system platforms and software generally.



Android is viewed as a competitive platform in the Linux and
    smartphone categories. If Android fails to gain operator

and/or

developer adoption, the Company’s financial results could
    be negatively impacted.

We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions.
    Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such
    actions on our business may be limited by a variety of factors.
    The cost-reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional
    production risk and have an adverse effect on our sales,
    profitability and ability to attract and retain employees.

We have been reducing costs and simplifying our product
    portfolios in all of our businesses, with sizable reductions in
    our Mobile Devices business. We have discontinued product lines,
    exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations,
    increased manufacturing with third parties, reduced our employee
    population and changed our compensation and benefit programs.

The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and
    profitability may be influenced by many factors including, but
    not limited to: (i) our ability to successfully complete
    these ongoing efforts; (ii) our ability to generate the
    level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable
    us to effectively compete; (iii) delays in implementation
    of anticipated workforce reductions in highly-regulated
    locations outside the United States, particularly in Europe and
    Asia; (iv) decline in employee morale and the potential
    inability to meet operational targets due to the loss of
    employees; (v) our ability to retain or recruit key
    employees, particularly as a result of recent actions to suspend
    the Company’s 401(k) contributions to employee accounts,
    permanently freeze all future benefit accruals under
    U.S. pension plans and eliminate merit increase programs in
    the U.S. and many other markets; (vi) the adequacy of our
    manufacturing capacity, including capacity provided by third
    parties; and (vii) the performance of other parties under
    contract manufacturing arrangements on which we rely for the
    manufacture of certain products, parts and components.

All of our businesses have consolidated or exited certain
    facilities and our products are manufactured in fewer facilities
    than in the past. While we have business continuity and risk
    management plans in place in case capacity is significantly
    reduced or eliminated at a given facility, the reduced number of
    alternative facilities could cause the duration of any
    manufacturing disruption to be longer. As a result, we could
    have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and
    profits could decline.

The demand for our products depends, in part, on the
    continued growth of the industries in which we participate. A
    market decline in any one of these industries could have an
    adverse effect on our business.

The rate at which the portions of the telecommunications
    industry in which we participate continue to grow is critical to
    our ability to improve our overall financial performance and we
    could be negatively impacted by a slowdown. Our business was
    very negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and the
    corresponding reduction in capital spending by the
    telecommunications industry from 2001 to 2003, and we are
    forecasting declines and slower growth in 2009 for the
    industries we compete in.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world
    and, as a result, we face risks that other companies that are
    not global may not face.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and
    more than half of our net sales are made to customers outside
    the U.S. In addition, we have many manufacturing,
    administrative and sales facilities outside the U.S. and
    more than half of our employees are employed outside the
    U.S. Most of our suppliers’ operations are outside the
    U.S., and most of our products are manufactured outside the
    U.S.

As with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations
    outside the U.S., we are exposed to risks that could negatively
    impact sales or profitability, including but not limited to:
    (i) tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes, customs
    classifications and certifications, including but not limited to
    changes in classifications or errors or omissions related to
    such classifications and certifications; (ii) changes in
    U.S. and

non-U.S. rules

related to trade, environmental, health and safety, technical
    standards & consumer protection; (iii) longer
    payment cycles; (iv) tax issues, such as tax law changes,
    variations in tax laws from country to country and as compared
    to the U.S., obligations under tax incentive agreements, and
    difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a
    tax-efficient manner; (v) currency fluctuations,
    particularly in the Chinese renminbi, Euro, Brazilian real,
    Taiwan dollar and Japanese yen; (vi) foreign exchange
    regulations, which may limit the Company’s ability to
    convert or repatriate foreign currency; (vii) challenges in
    collecting accounts receivable; (viii) cultural and
    language differences; (ix) employment regulations and local
    labor conditions; (x) difficulties protecting IP in foreign
    countries; (xi) instability in economic or political
    conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or
    anticipated military or political conflicts; (xii) natural
    disasters; (xiii) public health issues or outbreaks;



(xiv) changes in laws or regulations that adversely impact
    benefits being received by the Company; and (xv) the impact
    of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement
    arrangements.

Many of our products that are manufactured outside the
    U.S. are manufactured in Asia and Mexico. If manufacturing
    in these regions is disrupted, our overall capacity could be
    significantly reduced and sales or profitability could be
    negatively impacted. Furthermore, the legal system in China is
    still developing and is subject to change. Accordingly, our
    operations and orders for products in China could be adversely
    impacted by changes to, or interpretation of, Chinese law.

We also have presence in emerging markets such as India and
    Russia. We face challenges in emerging markets, including
    creating demand for our products and the negative impact of
    changes in the laws, or the interpretation of the laws, in those
    countries.

Changes in our operations or sales outside the
    U.S. markets could result in lost benefits in impacted
    countries and increase our cost of doing business.

The Company has entered into various agreements with

non-U.S. governments,

agencies, or similar organizations under which the Company
    receives certain benefits relating to its operations

and/or

sales
    in the jurisdiction. If the Company’s circumstances change
    and operations or sales are not at levels originally
    anticipated, the Company may be at risk of losing some or all of
    these benefits and increasing our cost of doing business.

If the quality of our products does not meet our
    customers’ expectations, then our sales and operating
    earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be adversely
    affected.

Some of the products we sell have quality issues resulting from
    the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software
    used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by
    components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers.
    Often these issues are identified prior to the shipment of the
    products and may cause delays in shipping products to customers,
    or even the cancellation of orders by customers. Sometimes, we
    discover quality issues in the products after they have been
    shipped to our customers, distributors or end-users, requiring
    us to resolve such issues in a timely manner that is the least
    disruptive to our customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment
    quality issues can have legal and financial ramifications,
    including: delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue
    or future orders, customer-imposed penalties on Motorola for
    failure to meet contractual requirements, increased costs
    associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative
    impact on our goodwill and brand name reputation.

In some cases, if the quality issue affects the product’s
    safety or regulatory compliance, then such a
    “defective” product may need to be recalled. Depending
    on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the
    field, it could cause the Company to incur substantial recall
    costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential
    loss of future orders, and the damage to the Company’s
    goodwill or brand/reputation. In addition, the Company may be
    required, under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for
    failed performance that might exceed the revenue that the
    Company receives from the contracts. Recalls involving
    regulatory agencies could also result in fines and additional
    costs. Finally, recalls could result in third-party litigation,
    including class action litigation by persons alleging common
    harm resulting from the purchase of the products.

If the volume of our sales decrease or do not reach projected
    targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing
    costs that may make our products less competitive.

We have negotiated favorable pricing terms with many of our
    suppliers, some of which have volume-based pricing. In the case
    of volume-based pricing arrangements, we may experience higher
    than anticipated costs if current volume-based purchase
    projections are not met. Some contracts have minimum purchase
    commitments and we may incur large financial penalties if these
    commitments are not met. We also may have unused production
    capacity if our current volume projections are not met,
    increasing our production cost per unit. In the future, as we
    establish new pricing terms, our volume demand could adversely
    impact future pricing from suppliers. All of these outcomes may
    result in our products being more costly to manufacture and less
    competitive.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to
    purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components
    to meet the demands of our customers.

Our ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on
    our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality
    materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We have
    experienced shortages in the past that have adversely affected
    our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to
    avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurances that
    we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore,
    certain



of our components are available only from a single source or
    limited sources. We may not be able to diversify sources in a
    timely manner. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a
    significant increase in the price of supplies could have a
    material adverse effect on our businesses.

Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form
    successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not
    develop as expected, our business may be adversely impacted.

We currently partner with industry leaders to meet customer
    product and service requirements and to develop innovative
    advances in design and technology. Some of our partnerships
    allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share
    the cost of developing next-generation technologies. Other
    partnerships allow us to offer more services and features to our
    customers. If such arrangements do not develop as expected, our
    business could be adversely impacted.

We rely on third-party distributors, representatives and
    retailers to sell certain of our products.

In addition to our own sales force, we offer our products
    through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives
    and retailers. Certain of our distributors or representatives
    may also market other products that compete with our products.
    The loss, termination or failure of one or more of our
    distributors or representatives to effectively promote our
    products, or changes in the financial or business condition of
    these distributors, representatives or retailers, could affect
    our ability to bring products to market.

We face many risks relating to intellectual property
    rights.

Our business will be harmed if: (i) we, our customers

and/or

our
    suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property
    rights of third parties, (ii) if the intellectual property
    indemnities in our supplier agreements are inadequate to cover
    damages and losses due to infringement of third-party
    intellectual property rights by supplier products, (iii) if
    we are required to provide broad intellectual property
    indemnities to our customers, or (iv) if our intellectual
    property protection is inadequate to protect our proprietary
    rights. We may be harmed if we are forced to make publicly
    available, under the relevant

open-source

licenses, certain internally developed

software-related

intellectual property as a result of either our use of

open-source

software code or the use of

third-party

software that contains

open-source

code.

Because our products are comprised of complex technology, much
    of which we acquire from suppliers through the purchase of
    components or licensing of software, we are often involved in or
    impacted by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual
    property rights. Third parties have asserted, and in the future
    may assert, intellectual property infringement claims against us
    and against our customers and suppliers. Defending claims may be
    expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and
    employees. Increasingly, third parties have sought broad
    injunctive relief which could limit our ability to sell our
    products in the U.S. or elsewhere with intellectual
    property subject to the claims. If we do not succeed in any such
    litigation, we could be required to expend significant resources
    to pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual property or
    to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the
    subject of such litigation. However, we cannot be certain that
    any such licenses, if available at all, will be available to us
    on commercially reasonable terms. In some cases, we might be
    forced to stop delivering certain products if we or our customer
    or supplier are subject to a final injunction.

We attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property
    indemnities with our suppliers for infringement of third-party
    intellectual property rights, but there is no assurance that we
    will be successful in our negotiations or that a supplier’s
    indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by Motorola
    and our customers due to the infringing products or that a
    supplier may choose to accept a license or modify or replace its
    products with non-infringing products which would otherwise
    mitigate such damages and losses. Further, Motorola may not be
    able to participate in intellectual property litigation
    involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any
    ultimate resolution or outcome that may adversely impact
    Motorola’s sales if a court enters an injunction that
    enjoins the supplier’s products or if the International
    Trade Commission issues an exclusionary order that blocks
    Motorola products from importation into the U.S.

In addition, our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify
    them broadly from all damages and losses resulting from
    intellectual property litigation against them. Because our
    customers often derive much larger revenue streams by reselling
    or leasing our products than we generate from the same products,
    these indemnity claims by our customers have the potential to
    expose us to damages that are much higher than we would be
    exposed to if we were sued directly.

Our patent and other intellectual property rights are important
    competitive tools and may generate income under license
    agreements. We regard our intellectual property rights as
    proprietary and attempt to protect them



with patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws,
    confidentiality agreements and other methods. We also generally
    restrict access to and distribution of our proprietary
    information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a
    third party to obtain and use our proprietary information or
    develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective
    patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be
    unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
    Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third
    parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our
    intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our
    business.

As we expand our business, including through acquisitions, and
    compete with new competitors in new markets, the breadth and
    strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new
    areas may not be as developed as in our longer-standing
    businesses. This may expose us to a heightened risk of
    litigation and other challenges from competitors in these new
    markets.

We face risks related to ongoing patent-related disputes
    between Qualcomm and Broadcom.

Motorola is a purchaser of CDMA EV-DO baseband processor chips
    and chipsets from Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”),
    and we previously announced an intention to design certain of
    Qualcomm’s W-CDMA chipsets into certain of our 3G handsets.
    Qualcomm and Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”) are
    engaged in several patent-related legal actions. In certain of
    these actions, Broadcom is seeking orders to ban the importation
    into the U.S. of Qualcomm’s infringing EV-DO and
    W-CDMA baseband processor chipsets and certain
    “downstream” products that contain them (including
    Motorola handsets)

and/or

limit
    Qualcomm’s ability to provide certain services and products
    in the U.S. relating to such infringing chipsets. A final
    outcome adverse to Qualcomm in any of the patent-related legal
    actions could have a material adverse impact on Motorola’s
    performance by making it difficult, more expensive or impossible
    for Motorola to make

and/or

import products destined for the U.S. market that use
    certain infringing Qualcomm chipsets. While we continue to work
    with Qualcomm and others on contingency plans relating to these
    cases, there is no guarantee that such plans will prove
    successful or avoid further legal challenge.

Our future financial results may be negatively impacted if we
    are not successful in licensing our intellectual property.

As part of the business strategy of some of our business
    segments, primarily our Mobile Devices business, we generate
    revenue through the licensing of intellectual property rights.
    The licensed rights include those that are essential to
    telecommunications standards, such as the GSM standard.
    Previously

agreed-upon

terms of some of our long-standing license agreements and the
    aging of our essential patent portfolio have reduced our royalty
    revenue over the past several years and are likely to continue
    to reduce that revenue. Uncertainty in the legal environment
    makes it difficult to assure that we will be able to enter into
    new license agreements that will be sufficient to offset that
    reduction in our revenue.

Many of our components and products are designed or
    manufactured by third parties and if third-party manufacturers
    lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant
    changes in the financial or business condition of such
    third-party manufacturers, it may have a material adverse effect
    on our business.

We rely on third-party suppliers for many of the components used
    in our products and we rely on third-party manufacturers to
    manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products. If we
    are not able to engage such manufacturers with the capabilities
    or capacities required by our business, or if such third parties
    lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant
    changes in the financial or business condition of such third
    parties, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We also have third-party arrangements for the design or
    manufacture of certain products, parts and components. If we are
    not able to engage such parties with the capabilities or
    capacities required by our business, or if these third parties
    fail to deliver quality products, parts and components on time
    and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling
    our orders and our sales and profits could decline.

We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other
    companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce
    significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to
    integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from
    the acquisitions.

In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth
    opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic
    acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
    These risks and uncertainties include: (i) the difficulty
    in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an
    efficient and effective manner; (ii) the challenges in
    achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits
    from acquisitions; (iii) the risk



that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets; (iv) the potential loss of key
    employees of the acquired businesses; (v) the risk of
    diverting the attention of senior management from our
    operations; (vi) the risks of entering new markets in which
    we have limited experience; (vii) risks associated with
    integrating financial reporting and internal control systems;
    (viii) difficulties in expanding information technology
    systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired
    businesses; and (ix) future impairments of goodwill of an
    acquired business.

Acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate
    may carry higher relative valuations (based on their earnings)
    than we do. This is particularly evident in software and
    services businesses. Acquiring a business that has a higher
    valuation than Motorola may be dilutive to our earnings,
    especially when the acquired business has little or no revenue.
    In addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly
    dilutive to near-term earnings and have, in the past, foregone
    certain of these acquisitions.

Key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial
    value in connection with a transaction in the form of

change-in-control

agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of
    restrictions on other equity- based compensation rights. To
    retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we
    may offer additional retention incentives, but it may still be
    difficult to retain certain key employees.

The value of our investments in the securities of various
    companies fluctuates and it may be difficult for us to realize
    the value of these investments.

We hold a portfolio of investments in various companies. Since
    the majority of these securities represent investments in
    technology companies, the fair market values of these securities
    are subject to significant price volatility. In addition, the
    realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
    other conditions.

We also have invested in numerous privately-held companies, many
    of which can still be considered in startup or developmental
    stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for
    the technologies or products they have under development are
    typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
    could lose all or substantially all of the value of our
    investments in these companies, and in some cases have.

The Sigma Fund holds U.S. Dollar-denominated debt
    obligations which include, among other securities, corporate
    bonds, asset- and mortgage-backed securities. As issuers of
    these securities continue to be negatively impacted by the
    weakened global economic environment and dislocation in the
    financial markets, the total fair value of the Sigma Fund
    holdings is less than its total original cost. The fair value of
    these holdings may experience further declines due to the
    widening credit spreads in several debt market segments or if
    the underlying debtors should default on their obligations. Such
    events could result in additional temporary unrealized losses or
    impairment charges in the Sigma Fund investments.

It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of
    highly-skilled employees that are necessary to remain
    competitive.

Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology
    industries is intense. We believe that our future success
    depends in large part on our continued ability to hire,
    assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified
    engineers and other highly-skilled personnel needed to compete
    and develop successful new products. We may not be as successful
    as our competitors at recruiting, assimilating, retaining and
    utilizing these highly-skilled personnel. In particular, we may
    have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly-skilled
    personnel during periods of poor operating performance, and as a
    result of recent actions to suspend the Company’s 401(k)
    contributions to employee accounts, permanently freeze all
    future benefit accruals under U.S. pension plans and
    eliminate merit increase programs in the U.S. and many other
    markets.

The unfavorable outcome of litigation pending or future
    litigation could materially impact the Company.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
    unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation. See
    “Item 3—Legal Proceedings.” There can be no
    assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation. In
    addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation and these
    costs could negatively impact our financial results.

We are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and
    safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental laws.

Our operations and the products we manufacture

and/or

sell
    are subject to a wide range of global laws. Compliance with
    existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or
    liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our
    ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and generally
    impact our financial



performance. Some of these laws relate to the use, disposal,
    clean up of, and exposure to hazardous substances. In the United
    States, laws often require parties to fund remedial studies or
    action regardless of fault. Motorola continues to incur disposal
    costs and has ongoing remediation obligations. Changes to
    U.S. environmental laws or our discovery of additional
    obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on
    Motorola.

Over the last several years, laws focused on: the energy
    efficiency of electronic products and accessories; recycling of
    both electronic products and packaging; and reducing or
    eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products
    have expanded significantly. Laws pertaining to accessibility
    features of electronic products, standardization of connectors
    and power supplies, sound levels of music playing devices, and
    other aspects are also proliferating.

These laws impact our products and make it more expensive to
    manufacture and sell product. It may also be difficult to comply
    with the laws in a timely way and we may not have compliant
    products available in the quantities requested by our customers,
    thereby impacting our sales and profitability.

We expect these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate
    increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction
    or elimination of certain hazardous constituents from products,
    increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional
    accessibility.

We are exposed to risks under large multi-year system
    contracts that may negatively impact our business.

We enter into large multi-year system contracts with large
    customers. This exposes us to risks, including: (i) the
    technological risks of such contracts, especially when the
    contracts involve new technology, and (ii) financial risks
    under these contracts, including the estimates inherent in
    projecting costs associated with large contracts and the related
    impact on operating results. We are also facing increasing
    competition from traditional system integrators and the defense
    industry as system contracts become larger and more complicated.
    Political developments also can impact the nature and timing of
    these large contracts.

It is important that we are able to obtain many different
    types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance
    we are forced to retain the risk.

The Company has many types of insurance coverage and also
    self-insures for some risks and obligations. The insurance
    market was disrupted after the events of September 11, 2001
    and the 2005 hurricanes. While the cost and availability of most
    insurance has stabilized, there are still certain types and
    levels of insurance that remain unavailable. Natural disasters
    and certain risks arising from securities claims and public
    liability are potential self-insured events that could
    negatively impact our financial results.

Government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the
    growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce
    barriers to entry for new competitors.

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
    allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and
    other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to
    wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal
    communications industry may be affected: (i) by regulations
    relating to the access to allocated spectrum for wireless
    communication users, especially in urban areas, (ii) if
    adequate frequencies are not allocated, or (iii) if new
    technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies
    currently allocated for such use. Industry growth has been and
    may continue to be affected by the cost of new licenses required
    to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
    new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
    offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
    systems, such as WiFi, mesh technologies and wide area network
    systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also
    deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow
    deployment of these and other technologies. Deregulation may
    introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
    our customers.

Changes in government policies and laws or economic
    conditions may adversely affect our financial results.

Our results may be affected by changes in trade, monetary and
    fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of
    U.S. and

non-U.S. governments,

agencies and similar organizations. Our results may also be
    affected by social and economic conditions, which impact our
    operations, including in emerging markets in Asia, India, Latin
    America and Eastern Europe, and in markets subject to ongoing
    political hostilities and war, including the Middle East.



In addition, the laws and regulations that apply directly to
    access to, or commerce on, the Internet are still evolving. We
    could be adversely affected by any such regulation in any
    country where we operate, including under the new presidential
    administration in the U.S. The adoption of such measures
    could decrease demand for our products and at the same time
    increase the cost of selling such products.

Consolidations in both the cable and telecommunication
    industries may adversely impact our business.

The cable and telecommunication industries have experienced
    consolidation and this trend is expected to continue according
    to industry estimates. Industry consolidation could result in
    delays of purchases or in the selection of new suppliers by the
    merged companies. This could adversely impact equipment
    suppliers like Motorola and our competitors. Due to continuing
    consolidation within the cable and telecommunications industries
    worldwide, a small number of operators own a majority of cable
    television systems and account for a significant portion of the
    capital spending made by cable telecommunications systems
    operators.

The effects of FCC regulations requiring separation of
    security functionality from set-tops could negatively impact our
    sales of set-tops to cable providers.

Historically, reception of digital television programming from a
    cable broadband network has required a set-top with security
    technology. Traditionally, cable service providers sold or
    leased their set-top to their customer. This security technology
    has limited the availability of set-tops to those manufactured
    by a few cable network manufacturers, including Motorola. FCC
    regulations requiring separation of security functionality from
    set-tops that are aimed at increasing competition and
    encouraging the sale of set-tops in the retail market became
    effective for most customers in 2007. As the retail market
    develops for set-tops and televisions capable of accepting the
    security modules, sales of our set-tops to cable providers may
    be negatively impacted. In addition, a full two-way security
    interface specification that allows retail customers access to
    all programming available on a cable operator’s network
    without the need for a set-top box has been adopted by a few
    television manufacturers. They began shipping television sets
    that incorporate this capability in 2008.

We rely on complex information technology systems and
    networks to operate our business. Any significant system or
    network disruption could have a material adverse impact on our
    operations, sales and operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex
    information technology systems and networks, some of which are
    within Motorola and some are outsourced. All information
    technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or
    interruption from a variety of sources, including but not
    limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts,
    natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
    failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new
    or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not
    installed properly. We have implemented various measures to
    manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but
    a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our
    operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur
    additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these
    disruptions or security breaches.

Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.

Our share price has been volatile due, in part, to generally
    volatile securities markets, and the volatility in the
    telecommunications and technology companies’ securities
    markets in particular. Factors other than our financial results
    that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to,
    market expectations of our performance, spending plans of our
    customers, and the level of perceived growth in the industries
    in which we participate.

The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of
    our income tax returns by the IRS could impact our financial
    results.

We are subject to continued examination of our income tax
    returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
    outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
    adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no
    assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations
    will not have an adverse effect on future operating results.

Failure of our suppliers to use acceptable ethical business
    practices could negatively impact our business.

It is our policy to require our suppliers to operate in
    compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding
    working conditions, employment practices, environmental
    compliance and trademark and copyright licensing. However, we do
    not control their labor and other business practices. If one of
    our suppliers violates labor or other laws or implements labor
    or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the
    shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders
    could be canceled, relationships could be terminated and our



reputation could be damaged. If one of our suppliers fails to
    procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights or
    patents, legal action could be taken against us that could
    impact the salability of our inventory and expose us to
    financial obligations to a third party. Any of these events
    could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of
    operations.

Copyright levies in numerous countries for the sale of
    products may adversely impact our business.

Motorola faces the possibility of substantial copyright levies
    from collecting societies in numerous countries for the sale of
    products that might be used for the private copying of copyright
    protected works such as mobile phones, memory cards, and set top
    boxes. The collecting societies argue that such levies should
    apply to such products because they include audio/video
    recording functionality, such as an MP3 player or DVR or storage
    capability, despite the fact that such products are not
    primarily intended to act as a recording device. As of this
    date, to our knowledge, no copyright levies have been paid to
    any collecting societies anywhere by any manufacturer. Motorola
    is currently working with other major mobile communications
    companies to challenge the applicability of these levies to
    mobile phones, and is also engaged in aggressive lobbying
    efforts against the levies in general at the European Union
    level. However, if these levies are imposed, our financial
    results will be negatively impacted.

Properties

Motorola’s principal executive offices are located at 1303
    East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196. Motorola also
    operates manufacturing facilities and sales offices in other
    U.S. locations and in many other countries. (See
    “Item 1: Business” for information regarding the
    location of the major facilities for each of Motorola’s
    business segments.) Motorola owns 35 facilities (manufacturing,
    sales, service and office), 21 of which are located in the
    Americas Region (USA, Canada, Mexico and Latin America) and 14
    of which are located in other countries. Motorola leases 321
    facilities, 140 of which are located in the Americas Region and
    181 of which are located in other countries. Motorola primarily
    utilizes 10 major facilities for the manufacturing and
    distribution of its products. These facilities are located in:
    Hangzhou and Tianjin, China; Taipei, Taiwan; Chennai, India;
    Penang, Malaysia; Schaumburg, Illinois; Jaguariuna, Brazil;
    Reynosa, Mexico; Arad, Israel; and Berlin, Germany.

During 2008 and the beginning of 2009, facilities in: Flensburg,
    Germany; Bohemia, New York; Glen Rock, New Jersey; Beijing,
    China; and Taunesstein, Germany were sold. Sites at Chandler,
    Arizona; Arlington Heights, Illinois; and Nogales, Mexico are
    currently for sale.

Motorola generally considers the productive capacity of the
    plants operated by each of its business segments to be adequate
    and sufficient for the requirements of each business group. The
    extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies
    from plant to plant and from time to time during the year.

A substantial portion of Motorola’s products are
    manufactured in Asia, primarily China, either in our own
    facilities or in the facilities of others who manufacture and
    assemble products for Motorola. If manufacturing in the region
    was disrupted, Motorola’s overall productive capacity could
    be significantly reduced.

Legal
    Proceedings

Telsim-Related
    Cases

In April 2001, Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
    (“Telsim”), a wireless telephone operator in Turkey,
    defaulted on the payment of approximately $2 billion of
    loans owed to Motorola and its subsidiaries (the “Telsim
    Loans”). The Uzan family controlled Telsim until 2004 when
    an agency of the Turkish government took over control of Telsim.
    In December 2005, Telsim was sold by the Turkish government to
    Vodafone and Motorola received an aggregate payment from the
    sale of $910 million.

The Company continues its efforts to collect on its judgment of
    $2.13 billion (the “U.S. Judgment”) for
    compensatory damages rendered by the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District
    Court”) against the Uzans on July 31, 2003 and
    affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
    Circuit (the “Second Circuit”) in 2004 and in
    connection with foreign proceedings against the Uzan family.
    However, the Company believes that the ongoing litigation,
    collection

and/or

settlement processes against the Uzan



family will be very lengthy in light of the Uzans’
    continued resistance to satisfy the judgments against them and
    their decision to violate various courts’ orders, including
    orders holding them in contempt of court. Following a remand
    from the Second Circuit of the U.S. Judgment, on
    February 8, 2006, the District Court awarded a judgment in
    favor of Motorola for $1 billion in punitive damages
    against the Uzan family and their co-conspirator, Antonio Luna
    Bettancourt. That decision was affirmed by the Second Circuit on
    November 21, 2007. The District Court, on April 10,
    2007, denied the Uzans’ motion to vacate the
    U.S. Judgment. The Uzans have appealed that decision to the
    Second Circuit.

Howell v.
    Motorola, Inc., et al.

A class action,

Howell v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

, was
    filed against Motorola and various of its directors, officers
    and employees in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of Illinois (“Illinois District
    Court”) on July 21, 2003, alleging breach of fiduciary
    duty and violations of the Employment Retirement Income Security
    Act (“ERISA”). The complaint alleged that the
    defendants had improperly permitted participants in the Motorola
    401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase or hold shares of
    common stock of Motorola because the price of Motorola’s
    stock was artificially inflated by a failure to disclose vendor
    financing to Telsim in connection with the sale of
    telecommunications equipment by Motorola. The plaintiff sought
    to represent a class of participants in the Plan and sought an
    unspecified amount of damages. On September 30, 2005, the
    district court dismissed the second amended complaint filed on
    October 15, 2004 (the “Howell Complaint”). Three
    new purported lead plaintiffs have since intervened in the case,
    and have filed a motion for class certification seeking to
    represent a class of Plan participants. On September 28,
    2007, the Illinois District Court granted the motion for class
    certification but narrowed the requested scope of the class. On
    October 25, 2007, the Illinois District Court modified the
    scope of the class, granted summary judgment dismissing two of
    the individually-named defendants in light of the narrowed
    class, and ruled that the judgment as to the original named
    plaintiff, Howell, would be immediately appealable. The class as
    certified includes all Plan participants for whose individual
    accounts the Plan purchased

and/or

held
    shares of Motorola common stock from May 16, 2000 through
    May 14, 2001, with certain exclusions. On February 15,
    2008 plaintiffs and defendants each filed motions for summary
    judgment in the Illinois District Court. On February 22,
    2008 the appellate court granted defendants’ motion for
    leave to appeal from the Illinois District Court’s

class-certification

decision. In addition, the original named plaintiff, Howell, has
    appealed the dismissal of his claim.

Silverman/Williams
    Federal Securities Lawsuits and Related Derivative
    Matters

A purported class action lawsuit on behalf of the purchasers of
    Motorola securities between July 19, 2006 and
    January 5, 2007,

Silverman v. Motorola, Inc., et
    al

., was filed against the Company and certain current and
    former officers and directors of the Company on August 9,
    2007, in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Illinois. The complaint alleges violations of
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
    SEC

Rule 10b-5

as well as, in the case of the individual defendants, the
    control person provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. The
    factual assertions in the complaint consist primarily of the
    allegation that the defendants knowingly made incorrect
    statements concerning Motorola’s projected revenues for the
    third and fourth quarter of 2006. The complaint seeks
    unspecified damages and other relief relating to the purported
    inflation in the price of Motorola shares during the class
    period. An amended complaint was filed December 20, 2007
    and Motorola moved to dismiss that complaint in February 2008.
    On September 24, 2008, the district court granted this
    motion in part to dismiss Section 10(b) claims as to two
    individuals and certain claims related to forward looking
    statements, among other things, and denied the motion in part.

In addition, on August 24, 2007, two lawsuits were filed as
    purportedly derivative actions on behalf of Motorola,

Williams v. Zander, et al.

, and

Cinotto v.
    Zander, et al.

, in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
    Illinois against the Company and certain of its current and
    former officers and directors. These complaints make similar
    factual allegations to those made in the

Silverman

complaint and assert causes of action for breach of
    fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of
    corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek
    unspecified damages associated with the alleged loss to the
    Company deriving from the defendants’ actions and demand
    that Motorola make a number of changes to its internal
    procedures. An amended complaint was filed on December 14,
    2007. On January 27, 2009, Motorola’s motion to
    dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in
    part.



In re
    Adelphia Communications Corp. Securities and Derivative
    Litigation

On December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a defendant in
    two cases relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
    Securities and Derivative Litigation

(the “Adelphia
    MDL”). The Adelphia MDL consists of at least fourteen
    individual cases and one purported class action that were filed
    in or have been transferred to the United States District Court
    for the Southern District of New York. First, Motorola was named
    as a defendant in the Second Amended Complaint in the individual
    case of

W.R. Huff Asset Management Co. L.L.C. v.
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, et al.

(the “Huff
    Complaint”). This case was originally filed by W.R. Huff
    Asset Management Co. L.L.C. on June 7, 2002, in the United
    States District Court for the Western District of New York and
    was subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New
    York as related to the Adelphia MDL. Motorola and several other
    individual and corporate defendants are named in the amended
    complaint.

As to Motorola, the complaint alleges a claim arising under
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to Adelphia securities, and
    seeks recovery of the consideration paid by plaintiff for
    Adelphia debt securities, compensatory damages, costs and
    expenses of litigation and other relief. Motorola filed a motion
    to dismiss this complaint on March 8, 2004, which was
    granted on January 29, 2009. Plaintiff’s motion to
    file an amended complaint is pending at this time.

Also on December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a
    defendant in

Stocke v. John J. Rigas, et al.

This
    case was originally filed in Pennsylvania and was subsequently
    transferred to the Southern District of New York as related to
    the Adelphia MDL. Motorola and several other individual and
    corporate defendants are named in the amended complaint. As to
    Motorola, the complaint generally makes the same allegations as
    the

Huff

Complaint and a state law claim of aiding and
    abetting fraud relating to Adelphia securities. The complaint
    seeks return of the consideration paid by plaintiff for Adelphia
    securities, punitive damages and other relief. Motorola filed a
    motion to dismiss this complaint on April 12, 2004. In
    March 2008, the

Stocke

plaintiff agreed to become a
    member of the purported class in

Argent

and the

Stocke

action was dismissed by the court as a stand-alone action.

On July 23, 2004, Motorola was named as a defendant in

Argent Classic Convertible Arbitrage Fund L.P., et
    al. v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., et al.

(the
    “Argent Complaint”). The Argent Complaint was filed
    against Scientific Atlanta and Motorola in the Southern District
    of New York. The Argent Complaint generally makes the same
    allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases relating to
    the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp. Securities and
    Derivative Litigation

that have been transferred to the
    Southern District of New York. The complaint seeks compensatory
    damages and other relief. Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the
    Argent Complaint on October 12, 2004, which is awaiting
    decision.

On September 14, 2004, a complaint filed in state court in
    Los Angeles, California, named Motorola, Scientific-Atlanta and
    certain officers of Scientific-Atlanta as defendants,

Los
    Angeles County Employees Retirement Association et al. v.
    Motorola, Inc., et al.

The complaint raises claims under
    California law for aiding and abetting fraud and conspiracy to
    defraud and generally makes the same allegations as the other
    previously disclosed cases relating to the

In re Adelphia
    Communications Corp. Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have been transferred to the Southern District of New
    York. There are no new substantive allegations. The complaint
    seeks compensatory damages, opportunity-cost damages, punitive
    and other exemplary damages and other relief. In late 2004, the
    Multi-District Litigation Panel transferred the case to federal
    court in New York, which transfer is now final. Motorola filed a
    motion to dismiss the complaint in this action on
    September 19, 2005, which is awaiting decision.

On October 25, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
    filed in state court in Fulton County, Georgia, naming Motorola
    and Scientific-Atlanta and certain officers of
    Scientific-Atlanta,

AIG DKR SoundShore Holdings, Ltd., et
    al. v. Scientific-Atlanta Inc., et al.

The complaint
    raises claims under Georgia law of conspiracy to defraud and
    generally makes the same allegations as the other previously
    disclosed cases relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications
    Corp. Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have already
    been filed and transferred to the Southern District of New York.
    The complaint seeks damages and statutory compensation, punitive
    damages and other relief. On April 18, 2005, the
    Multi-District Litigation Panel issued a final order
    transferring the case to New York and that transfer is
    final. Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in this
    action on September 19, 2005, which is awaiting decision.

Adelphia
    Communications Corp.—Bankruptcy Court Lawsuit

On June 23, 2006, Adelphia, on behalf of the estate and the
    various classes of Adelphia creditors, objected to
    Motorola’s claim for payment of $67 million and
    asserted causes of action against Motorola including
    preferences,



avoidance of liens, fraudulent transfers, equitable
    subordination and aiding and abetting fraud as part of the
    ongoing

Adelphia

bankruptcy action in the Bankruptcy
    Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiff is
    alleging damages in excess of $1 billion against Motorola
    for the

above-stated

causes of action. The bankruptcy action is still pending.

Intellectual
    Property Related Cases

Tessera,
    Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

Motorola is a purchaser of semiconductor chips with certain ball
    grid array (“BGA”) packaging from suppliers including
    Qualcomm, Inc. (“Qualcomm”), Freescale Semiconductor,
    Inc. (“Freescale Semiconductor”), ATI Technologies,
    Inc. (“ATI”), Spansion Inc. (“Spansion”),
    and STMicroelectronics N.V. (“STMicro”). On
    April 17, 2007, Tessera, Inc. (“Tessera”) filed
    patent infringement legal actions against Qualcomm, Freescale
    Semiconductor, ATI, Spansion, STMicro and Motorola in the
    U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”)
    (In the Matter of Certain Semiconductor Chips with Minimized
    Chip Package Size and Products Containing Same, Inv.

No. 337-TA-605)

and the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas,

Tessera, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., Qualcomm, Inc.,
    Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. and ATI Technologies, Inc.

,
    alleging that certain BGA packaged semiconductors infringe
    patents that Tessera claims to own. Tessera is seeking orders to
    ban the importation into the U.S. of certain semiconductor
    chips with BGA packaging and certain “downstream”
    products that contain them (including Motorola products)

and/or

limit
    suppliers’ ability to provide certain services and products
    or take certain actions in the U.S. relating to the
    packaged chips. On December 1, 2008, an Administrative Law
    Judge issued an initial determination that Tessera failed to
    prove that BGA packaged semiconductors contained in Motorola
    products infringe Tessera’s patent claims. On
    January 30, 2009, the International Trade Commission issued
    a notice that it will review the Administrative Law Judge’s
    initial determination and a final determination on the merits is
    expected on or before April 14, 2009. The patent claims
    being asserted by Tessera are subject to reexamination
    proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
    (“PTO”).

Motorola is a defendant in various other suits, claims and
    investigations that arise in the normal course of business. In
    the opinion of management, and other than discussed above with
    respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate disposition of the
    Company’s pending legal proceedings will not have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

PERFORMANCE
    GRAPH

The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total
    returns of Motorola, Inc., the S&P 500 Index and the
    S&P Communications Equipment Index.

This graph assumes $100 was invested in the stock or the Index
    on December 31, 2003 and also assumes the reinvestment of
    dividends. This graph assumes reinvestment of the Company’s
    distribution to its shareholders of 0.110415 shares of
    Class B common stock of Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.
    (“Freescale Class B Shares”) on December 2,
    2004 for each share of Motorola common stock. For purposes of
    this graph, the Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. distribution is
    treated as a non-taxable cash dividend of $2.06 (the value of
    0.110415 Freescale Class B Shares, based on Freescale
    Semiconductor’s December 2, 2004 closing price of
    $18.69) that would have been reinvested in Motorola common stock
    at the close of business on December 2, 2004.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Item 7: Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial
    position and results of operations for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2008. This commentary
    should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
    statements and the notes thereto appearing under
    “Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.”

Executive
    Overview

What
    businesses are we in?

Motorola reports financial results for the following three
    operating business segments:

•

The

Mobile Devices

segment designs, manufactures, sells
    and services wireless handsets with integrated software and
    accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. The
    segment’s net sales in 2008 were $12.1 billion,
    representing 40% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

•

The

Home and Networks Mobility

segment designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) digital
    video, Internet Protocol video and broadcast network interactive
    set-tops, end-to-end video delivery systems, broadband access
    infrastructure platforms, and associated data and voice customer
    premise equipment to cable television and telecom service
    providers (collectively, referred to as the “home
    business”), and (ii) wireless access systems,
    including cellular infrastructure systems and wireless broadband
    systems, to wireless service providers (collectively, referred
    to as the “network business”). The segment’s net
    sales in 2008 were $10.1 billion, representing 33% of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales.

•

The

Enterprise Mobility Solutions

segment designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and digital
    two-way radio, voice and data communications products and
    systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and
    end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions to a wide range of
    enterprise markets, including government and public safety
    agencies (which, together with all sales to distributors of
    two-way communication products, are referred to as the
    “government and public safety market”), as well as
    retail, energy and utilities, transportation, manufacturing,
    healthcare and other commercial customers (which, collectively,
    are referred to as the “commercial enterprise
    market”). The segment’s net sales in 2008 were
    $8.1 billion, representing 27% of the Company’s
    consolidated net sales.

What were
    our 2008 financial results?

•

Net Sales were $30.1 Billion:

Our net sales
    were $30.1 billion in 2008, down 18% compared to net sales
    of $36.6 billion in 2007. Net sales decreased 36% in the
    Mobile Devices segment, increased 1% in the Home and Networks
    Mobility segment and increased 5% in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segment.

•

Operating Loss of $2.4 Billion:

We incurred an
    operating loss of $2.4 billion in 2008, compared to an
    operating loss of $553 million in 2007. Operating margin
    was (7.9)% of net sales in 2008, compared to (1.5)% of net sales
    in 2007. Contributing to the operating loss were:
    (i) $1.8 billion of goodwill and other asset
    impairment charges, (ii) $393 million of net charges
    for reorganization and separation-related transaction costs,
    (iii) excess inventory and other related charges of
    $370 million due to a decision to consolidate software and
    silicon platforms in the Mobile Devices segment, and (iv) a
    $150 million charge related to the settlement of a purchase
    commitment.

•

Loss from Continuing Operations of $4.2 Billion, or
    $1.87 per Share:

We incurred a loss from
    continuing operations of $4.2 billion, or $1.87 per diluted
    common share, in 2008, compared to a loss from continuing
    operations of $105 million, or $0.05 per diluted common
    share, in 2007. Contributing to the loss from continuing
    operations in 2008 were: (i) a $2.4 billion operating
    loss, (ii) a $2.1 billion reserve related to our
    deferred tax asset valuation allowance,
    (iii) $365 million of other-than-temporary investment
    impairment charges, (iv) $186 million of impairment
    charges on Sigma Fund investments, and
    (v) $101 million of temporary unrealized losses of
    Sigma Fund investments, partially offset by: (i) the tax
    benefit resulting from our operating loss, and (ii) a
    $237 million curtailment gain associated with the decision
    to freeze benefit accruals in the U.S. pension plans.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

2008 Global Handset Market Share Estimated at 8%, based on
    Annual Handset Shipments of 100.1 Million
    Units:

We estimate our share of the global
    handset market in 2008 was approximately 8%, a decrease of
    approximately 6 percentage points versus 2007. We shipped
    100.1 million handsets in 2008, a 37% decrease compared to
    shipments of 159.1 million handsets in 2007. We estimate
    our market share in the fourth quarter of 2008 was approximately
    6%, a decrease of approximately 6 percentage points versus
    the fourth quarter of 2007. We shipped 19.2 million
    handsets in the fourth quarter of 2008, a 53% decrease compared
    to shipments of 40.9 million handsets in the fourth quarter
    of 2007.

What were
    the financial results for our three operating business segments
    in 2008?

•

In Our Mobile Devices Business:

Net sales were
    $12.1 billion in 2008, a decrease of 36% compared to net
    sales of $19.0 billion in 2007. On a geographic basis, net
    sales decreased substantially in North America, the Europe,
    Middle East and Africa region (“EMEA”), and Asia and,
    to a lesser extent, decreased in Latin America. The decrease in
    net sales was primarily driven by a 37% decrease in unit
    shipments.

The segment incurred an operating loss of $2.2 billion in
    2008, compared to an operating loss of $1.2 billion in
    2007. The increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a
    decrease in gross margin, driven by: (i) the 36% decrease
    in net sales, (ii) excess inventory and other related
    charges of $370 million in 2008 due to a decision to
    consolidate software and silicon platforms, and (iii) a
    $150 million charge in 2008 related to the settlement of a
    purchase commitment, partially offset by: (i) the absence
    in 2008 of a $277 million charge for a legal settlement in
    2007, and (ii) savings from supply chain cost-reduction
    initiatives. The decrease in gross margin was partially offset
    by decreases in: (i) selling, general and administrative
    (“SG&A”) expenses, primarily due to lower
    marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives,
    and (ii) research and development (“R&D”)
    expenditures, reflecting savings from cost-reduction initiatives.

•

In Our Home and Networks Mobility
    Business:

Net sales were $10.1 billion in
    2008, an increase of 1% compared to net sales of
    $10.0 billion in 2007. On a geographic basis, net sales
    increased in Latin America and Asia, and decreased in North
    America and EMEA. The increase in net sales primarily reflects a
    16% increase in net sales by the home business, partially offset
    by an 11% decrease in net sales by the networks business.

Operating earnings were $918 million, an increase of 29%
    compared to operating earnings of $709 million in 2007. The
    increase in operating earnings was primarily due to:
    (i) decreases in both SG&A and R&D expenditures,
    primarily related to savings from cost-reduction initiatives,
    and (ii) a decrease in reorganization of business charges,
    relating primarily to lower employee severance costs. These
    factors were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin,
    primarily due to: (i) an unfavorable product mix, and
    (ii) the absence of net sales by embedded communication
    computing group (“ECC”) that was divested at the end
    of 2007.

•

In Our Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    Business:

Net sales were $8.1 billion in
    2008, an increase of 5% compared to net sales of
    $7.7 billion in 2007. On a geographic basis, net sales
    increased in EMEA, Asia and Latin America and decreased in North
    America. The increase in net sales reflects an 8% increase in
    net sales to the government and public safety market, partially
    offset by a 2% decrease in net sales to the commercial
    enterprise market.

Operating earnings were $1.5 billion, an increase of 23%
    compared to operating earnings of $1.2 billion in 2007. The
    increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase
    in gross margin, driven by: (i) the 5% increase in net
    sales, (ii) a favorable product mix, (iii) the absence
    in 2008 of an inventory-related charge in connection with the
    acquisition of Symbol Technologies, Inc. (“Symbol”)
    during the first quarter of 2007, and (iv) a decrease in
    SG&A expenses, primarily related to savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. The increase in gross margin was
    partially offset by increased R&D expenditures, primarily
    due to developmental engineering expenditures for new product
    development and investment in next-generation technologies.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

What were
    our major challenges and accomplishments in 2008?

•

In our Mobile Devices Business:

2008 was a
    very difficult year for our Mobile Devices business. Demand for
    Motorola’s wireless handsets declined in 2008 primarily due
    to limited product offerings in critical market segments,
    particularly 3G products, including smartphones, as well as very
    low-tier products. We also were impacted by the worldwide
    economic downturn in the second half of 2008, as the overall
    market for handsets grew at a slower rate than in 2007,
    particularly in the fourth quarter. Motorola believes it lost
    approximately 6 percentage points of market share and estimates
    its global market share was approximately 8% for the full year
    2008.

During 2008, the Mobile Devices business launched a number of
    new products, including: new feature phones for GSM, CDMA and
    UMTS technologies; additions to the ROKR family of music
    devices; additions to the smartphone portfolio, including Q and
    MING devices, for consumers who multi-task and want flexibility
    in today’s business environment; and several handsets at
    affordable price points for consumers with everyday
    communications needs.

The Mobile Devices business has taken significant actions in
    2008 to reduce its size and cost structure, including actions to
    simplify its wireless handset platforms and enhance its product
    portfolio. To that end, we announced that our silicon strategy
    is to use two primary silicon providers to achieve faster time
    to market and reduce costs. Our software platforms will focus on
    fewer operating systems, including Android (a Google-developed,
    royalty-free platform) and Windows Mobile (a Microsoft
    platform). Our portfolio focus will be increasingly on 3G and
    smartphone devices, particularly in the mid- and high-price
    tiers, while continuing to focus on our proprietary iDEN
    technology and CDMA software platforms. In addition to our
    portfolio streamlining and enhancement efforts, over the next
    year we will also increase our focus in priority markets. These
    markets will include North America, Latin America and parts of
    Asia, including China.

Actions taken throughout the year, including the decisions to
    reduce platforms and focus on key markets, resulted in a lower
    operating expense cost structure in 2008 compared to 2007.

•

In our Home and Networks Mobility
    Business:

The Home and Networks Mobility business
    improved its operating margin and remained the world’s
    leading provider of digital entertainment devices. Total net
    sales in the home business grew by 16% in the year, which
    included significant business growth outside of the U.S. The
    business enhanced its portfolio of advanced video, voice, and
    data platforms with several new product introductions, including
    DOCSIS 3.0 products, MPEG-4 compression technology, and the
    DCX-series of multimedia digital entertainment devices. The home
    business completed the acquisition of Dahua Digital to increase
    our position in the rapidly growing cable market in China.

Net sales in the networks business were lower primarily due to
    the absence of net sales by ECC that was divested at the end of
    2007. The networks business also experienced a decline in sales
    of iDEN, CDMA and GSM technologies, while sales of WiMAX and
    UMTS technologies and related services increased. Motorola
    continued its investments in and focus on next-generation
    wireless broadband technologies, including WiMAX and LTE. Our
    first sales for WiMAX network equipment were recorded in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, Motorola was the first
    wireless networks infrastructure supplier to demonstrate a
    handoff between CDMA EV-DO rev. A and LTE, as well as the first
    over-the-air session of LTE in the 700MHz band. Despite the
    challenges facing the wireless infrastructure industry,
    Motorola’s networks business improved its profitability
    compared to 2007 and demonstrated leadership in next-generation
    technologies.

•

In our Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    Business:

In 2008, the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions business delivered solid results, including an
    improvement in operating margin. The business continued to
    maintain leading market share positions in several highly
    competitive markets.

Within the government and public safety market, sales grew as
    demand for integrated, interoperable public safety
    communications increased. As new and better spectrum utilization
    evolves, demand and sales have increased for high-speed data
    applications, such as video surveillance, dual-mode devices,
    including the MOTOTRBO product family, and other data-based
    products. In addition to our continued success in the U.S., our
    largest market, the business experienced significant growth in
    all markets outside of the U.S. The business acquired a
    controlling interest in Vertex Standard Co., Ltd. to further
    expand its two-way radio portfolio and open up new market
    opportunities, both in the U.S. and internationally. We
    also announced



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND

the industry leading APX family of products, including mobile
    and portable radios and infrastructure, and received very
    positive customer response.

During the year, the commercial enterprise business enhanced its
    product portfolio by launching several new mobile computing,
    wireless computing and advanced data capture products that
    further strengthened our position in the commercial enterprise
    marketplace. The enhanced mobile computing offerings included
    the MC75 product lines, which had very successful product
    launches and were well received in all regions. The portfolio
    was also strengthened by the acquisition of AirDefense, a
    leading provider of premium software security applications for
    wireless LAN networks.

Looking
    Forward

Adverse economic conditions around the world have impacted many
    customers and consumers and resulted in slowing demand for many
    of our businesses. However, the longer-term, fundamental trend
    regarding the dissolution of boundaries between the home, work
    and mobility continues to evolve. We believe our focus on
    designing and delivering differentiated wireless communications
    products, unique experiences and powerful networks, as well as
    complementary support services, will enable consumers to have a
    broader choice of when, where and how they connect to people,
    information, and entertainment. While many markets we serve will
    have little to no growth, or even contraction in 2009, there
    still remain large numbers of businesses and consumers around
    the world who have yet to experience the benefits of converged
    wireless communications, mobility, and the Internet. As
    economies, financial markets and business conditions improve,
    this will present new opportunities to extend our brand, to
    market our products and services, and to pursue profitable
    growth.

In 2008, the Company announced that it was pursuing the creation
    of two independent, publicly traded companies: one comprised of
    our Mobile Devices business, and the other comprised of our Home
    and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    businesses (collectively, referred to as “Broadband
    Mobility Solutions businesses”). The Company also indicated
    that it was targeting the third quarter of 2009 for the
    separation to occur. However, due to the weakened global
    economic environment and dislocation in the financial markets,
    as well as changes underway in the Mobile Devices business, the
    Company is no longer targeting the third quarter of 2009 to
    complete the separation. The Company has made progress on
    various elements of its separation plan. Management and the
    Board of Directors remain committed to separation in as
    expeditious a manner as possible and continue to believe this is
    the best path for the Company. Goldman Sachs & Co., the
    Company’s primary financial advisor on this matter,
    supports this direction. The Board continues to work with its
    financial advisors on potential alternative separation
    structures. The Board further believes that in working with its
    financial advisors the Company will be able to find a structure
    which will permit separation in a way that maximizes value for
    all shareholders.

We expect the overall global handset market to remain intensely
    competitive with lower total demand due to the continued adverse
    economic environment around the world. Our strategy is focused
    on simplifying product platforms, enhancing our product
    portfolio in the mid- and high-tier, reducing cost structure and
    strengthening our position in priority markets. To this end, in
    2008, we have reduced the number of product platforms that we
    support, increasing our emphasis on 3G and smartphone devices
    while maintaining our focus on CDMA and iDEN technologies. We
    expect our transition to a more competitive portfolio will show
    progress by the fourth quarter 2009 and continue in 2010. In
    addition to our portfolio streamlining and enhancement efforts,
    over the next year we will also increase our focus in priority
    markets. These markets will include North America, Latin America
    and parts of Asia, including China. Along with our mobile
    handset initiatives, we have also increased focus on our
    accessories portfolio to deliver complete mobile experiences and
    to complement our handset features and functionalities. In
    addition to our efforts to dramatically improve the product
    portfolio, we have implemented cost-reduction initiatives to
    ensure that we have a more competitive cost structure. These
    actions will accelerate our speed to market with new products,
    allow us to offer richer consumer experiences and improve our
    financial performance.

In our Home and Networks Mobility business, we are focused on
    delivering personalized media experiences to consumers at home
    and on-the-go and enabling service providers to operate their
    networks more efficiently and profitably. We will build on our
    market leading position in digital entertainment devices and
    video delivery systems to capitalize on demand for high
    definition TV, personalized video services, broadband
    connectivity and higher speed. We will also deliver broadband
    access systems and gateway products for video, voice and data
    services. However, due to the impact that economic conditions,
    especially in the U.S., may have on demand for services provided
    by some of our customers, demand is likely to slow in 2009 in
    the home business. We will continue to make investments to
    position ourselves as a leading infrastructure provider of
    next-generation wireless technologies. As more networks are
    commercialized, we expect an increase in WiMAX sales
    opportunities beginning in 2009. We expect the overall 2G and 3G
    wireless infrastructure market to decline compared to 2008 and
    to remain highly competitive. The Home and Networks Mobility
    business will continue to optimize its cost structure and
    prioritize investments in innovation and future growth
    opportunities. This will position the business

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

for future opportunities in emerging technologies, including
    video and wireline and wireless broadband, and enable the
    business to maintain profitability in mature technologies.

In our Enterprise Mobility Solutions business, we will build on
    our leadership position in mission-critical communications
    solutions and develop next-generation products and services for
    our government and public safety customers around the world.
    This will enable us to address the continued high priority
    placed on public safety and homeland security by our customers.
    Our business-critical enterprise communications products,
    including two-way communications, mobile computing, and advanced
    data capture products and services, allow our customers to
    reduce cost, increase worker mobility and productivity, and
    enhance their customers’ experiences. We offer this leading
    portfolio across a broad spectrum of commercial enterprise
    markets, including retail, transportation, utility,
    manufacturing, and healthcare industries.

Our government and enterprise customers are facing uncertainty
    and volatility as a result of the ongoing global financial
    crisis. This will likely lead to lower capital spending by these
    customers and slowing demand in the markets served by our
    Enterprise Mobility Solutions business. Over 40 U.S. states
    and many local governments are facing budget deficits in 2009,
    and some states may be required to significantly curtail
    spending. Additionally, many governments outside the
    U.S. are facing 2009 budget deficits. Although we continue
    to believe that our government customers will prioritize public
    safety and homeland security spending, budget constraints could
    impact the timing and volume of purchases by these customers. We
    believe that our comprehensive portfolio of products and
    services, leadership positions in government and public safety
    and commercial enterprise markets and global network of channel
    partners and distributors make our Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    business well positioned to meet these challenges.

On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Stimulus Package”)
    became law. The Stimulus Package implements $787 billion of
    spending and investment by the U.S. federal government,
    including spending in areas of infrastructure and technology
    that may benefit our customers and Motorola. Our domestic
    government and public safety customers may benefit from
    additional funding for state and local law enforcement agencies
    and homeland defense initiatives. Opportunities for our Home and
    Networks Mobility business may result from Stimulus Package
    funding for broadband and wireless internet initiatives. In
    addition, as many foreign governments consider similar packages
    as a way to combat the ongoing global financial crisis, our
    foreign customers may benefit from additional funding from
    stimulus packages applicable to them.

During 2008 and in January 2009, the Company initiated a number
    of global actions to reduce its cost structure. These actions
    were primarily focused on our Mobile Devices business, but also
    included the other businesses and corporate functions. Actions
    included workforce reductions, prioritization of investments,
    spending controls and changes to compensation and benefit
    programs. These actions are expected to result in a further
    reduction in the Company’s cost structure in 2009. To
    ensure alignment with changing market conditions, the Company
    will continually review its cost structure as it aggressively
    manages costs throughout 2009 while maintaining investments in
    innovation and future growth opportunities.

Our investment priorities include: next-generation wireless
    converged communications products and services for enterprise
    markets; advanced technologies and applications for
    mission-critical communications in government and public safety
    markets; broadband video systems for service providers; and
    next-generation wireless handsets with application services.
    These investments, together with the acquisitions of recent
    years, are designed to foster continued innovation and position
    us for future profitable growth opportunities.

In light of the ongoing global financial crisis and the severe
    tightening in the worldwide credit markets, the Company is very
    focused on the strength of its balance sheet and its overall
    liquidity position. In 2009, operating cash flow improvement,
    working capital management and preservation of total cash will
    continue to be major focuses for the Company. We will continue
    to direct our available funds, including our Sigma Fund
    investments, primarily into cash or very highly-rated,
    short-term securities. In February 2009, the Company announced
    that its Board of Directors suspended the declaration of
    quarterly stock dividends. We also plan to reduce capital
    expenditures in 2009 compared to 2008.

In addition to the $2.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and Sigma Fund investments (“Cash
    and Sigma Funds”) the Company held in the U.S. at the
    end of 2008, the Company held $5.4 billion of Cash and
    Sigma Funds in foreign jurisdictions. The Company repatriated
    over $2 billion to the U.S. in 2008 at minimal cash
    tax cost and expects to continue to efficiently repatriate funds
    from international jurisdictions to the U.S. in 2009. Given
    the level of Cash and Sigma Funds, the Company believes it has
    more than sufficient liquidity to operate its business.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We conduct our business in highly competitive markets, facing
    both new and established competitors. The markets for many of
    our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies,
    frequent new product introductions, changing consumer trends,
    short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
    Market disruptions caused by new technologies, the entry of new
    competitors into markets we serve, and frequent consolidations
    among our customers and competitors, among other matters, can
    introduce volatility into our operating performance and cash
    flow from operations. As we enter 2009, we face a very
    challenging global economic environment and with reduced
    visibility and slowing demand. Meeting all of these challenges
    requires consistent operational planning and execution and
    investment in technology, resulting in innovative products that
    meet the needs of our customers around the world. As we execute
    on meeting these objectives, we remain focused taking the
    necessary action to design and deliver differentiated and
    innovative products and services that will advance the way the
    world connects by simplifying and personalizing communications
    and enhancing mobility.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results
    of Operations—2008 Compared to 2007

Net
    Sales

Net sales were $30.1 billion in 2008, down 18% compared to
    net sales of $36.6 billion in 2007. The decrease in net
    sales reflects a $6.9 billion, or 36%, decrease in net
    sales in the Mobile Devices segment, partially offset by:
    (i) a $364 million, or 5%, increase in net sales in
    the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment, and (ii) a
    $72 million, or 1%, increase in net sales in the Home and
    Networks Mobility segment. The 36% decrease in net sales in the
    Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by a 37% decrease in
    unit shipments. The 5% increase in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segment net sales reflects an 8% increase in net sales
    to the government and public safety market, partially offset by
    a 2% decrease in net sales to the commercial enterprise market.
    The 1% increase in net sales in the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment reflects a 16% increase in net sales in the home
    business, partially offset by an 11% decrease in net sales in
    the networks business.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin was $8.4 billion, or 27.8% of net sales, in
    2008, compared to $10.0 billion, or 27.2% of net sales, in
    2007. The decrease in gross margin reflects lower gross margin
    in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility segments,
    partially offset by increased gross margin in the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segment. The decrease in gross margin in the
    Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by: (i) the 36%
    decrease in net sales, (ii) excess inventory and other
    related charges recorded in 2008 of $370 million due to a
    decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms, and
    (iii) a $150 million charge recorded in 2008 related
    to the settlement of a purchase commitment, partially offset by:
    (i) the absence in 2008 of a $277 million charge for a
    legal settlement recorded in 2007, and (ii) savings from
    supply chain cost-reduction activities. The decrease in gross
    margin in the Home and Networks Mobility segment was primarily
    due to: (i) an unfavorable product mix, and (ii) the
    absence of net sales by ECC that was divested at the end of
    2007. The increase in gross margin in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segment was primarily driven by: (i) the 5%
    increase in net sales, (ii) a favorable product mix, and
    (iii) the absence in 2008 of an inventory-related charge in
    connection with the acquisition of Symbol during the first
    quarter of 2007.

The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in
    2008 compared to the 2007 was driven by an increase in gross
    margin percentage in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment,
    partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage in the
    Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility segments. The
    Company’s overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales
    can be impacted by the proportion of overall net sales generated
    by its various businesses.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses decreased 15% to $4.3 billion, or 14.4% of net
    sales, in 2008, compared to $5.1 billion, or 13.9% of net
    sales, in 2007. The decrease in SG&A expenses reflects
    lower SG&A expenses in all segments. The decrease in the
    Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by lower marketing
    expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives. The
    decreases in the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segments were primarily due to savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percentage
    of net sales increased in the Mobile Devices segment and
    decreased in the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segments.

Research
    and Development Expenditures

Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
    decreased 7% to $4.1 billion, or 13.6% of net sales, in
    2008, compared to $4.4 billion, or 12.1% of net sales, in
    2007. The decrease in R&D expenditures reflects lower
    R&D expenditures in the Mobile Devices and Home and
    Networks Mobility segments, partially offset by higher R&D
    expenditures in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The
    decreases in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility
    segments were primarily due to savings from cost-reduction
    initiatives. The increase in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment was primarily due to developmental engineering
    expenditures for new product development and investment in
    next-generation technologies. R&D expenditures as a
    percentage of net sales increased in the Mobile Devices and
    Enterprise Mobility Solutions segments and decreased in the Home
    and Networks Mobility segment. The Company participates in very
    competitive industries with constant changes in technology and,
    accordingly, the Company continues to believe that a strong
    commitment to R&D is required to drive long-term growth.

Other
    Charges

The Company recorded net charges of $2.3 billion in Other
    charges in 2008, compared to net charges of $1.0 billion in
    2007. The net charges in 2008 include:
    (i) $1.8 billion of goodwill and other asset
    impairment charges, (ii) $318 million of charges
    relating to the amortization of intangible assets,
    (iii) $248 million of net reorganization of business
    charges included in Other charges, and
    (iv) $59 million of transaction costs related to the
    proposed separation of the Company into two independent,
    publicly traded companies, partially offset by a
    $48 million gain on the sale of property, plant and
    equipment. The net charges in 2007 included:
    (i) $369 million of charges relating to the
    amortization of intangibles, (ii) $290 million of net
    reorganization of business charges included in Other charges,
    (iii) $140 million of charges for legal settlements
    and related insurance matters, (iv) $96 million of
    acquisition-related in-process research and development charges
    (“IPR&D”) relating to 2007 acquisitions, and
    (v) $89 million of asset impairment charges. The net
    reorganization of business charges are discussed in further
    detail in the “Reorganization of Businesses” section.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $48 million in 2008, compared to
    net interest income of $91 million in 2007. Net interest
    income in 2008 includes interest income of $272 million,
    partially offset by interest expense of $224 million. Net
    interest income in 2007 included interest income of
    $456 million, partially offset by interest expense of
    $365 million. The decrease in net interest income is
    primarily attributed to lower interest income due to the
    decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Fund
    balances in 2008 compared to 2007 and the significant decrease
    in short-term interest rates. This decrease was partially offset
    by a decrease in interest expense in 2008 due to the reversal of
    $89 million of interest accruals that are no longer needed
    as a result of the effective settlement of certain tax audits.

Gains on
    Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
    $82 million in 2008, compared to $50 million in 2007.
    In 2008, the net gain primarily relates to sales of a number of
    the Company’s equity investments, of which $29 million
    of gain was attributed to a single investment. In 2007, the net
    gain primarily reflects a gain of $34 million from the sale
    of the Company’s embedded communications computing group.

Other

Net charges classified as Other, as presented in Other income
    (expense), were $376 million in 2008, compared to net
    income of $22 million in 2007. The net charges in 2008 were
    primarily comprised of: (i) $365 million of
    other-than-temporary investment impairment charges of which
    $138 million was attributed to an equity security held by
    the Company as a strategic investment, (ii) $186 million of
    impairment charges on Sigma Fund investments resulting primarily
    from investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Washington
    Mutual, Inc. and Sigma Finance Corporation, an unrelated special
    investment vehicle managed by United Kingdom-based Gordian Knot
    Limited, (iii) $101 million of temporary unrealized
    losses on Sigma Fund investments, and (iv) $84 million of
    foreign currency losses, partially offset by: (i) a
    $237 million curtailment gain associated with the decision
    to freeze benefit accruals in the U.S. pension plans,
    (ii) $56 million of gains related to the
    extinguishment of a liability, and (iii) $24 million
    of gains relating to several interest rate swaps not designated
    as hedges. The net income in 2007 was primarily comprised of
    $97 million of foreign currency gains, partially offset by
    $62 million of investment impairment charges.

Effective
    Tax Rate

The Company recorded $1.6 billion of net tax expense in
    2008, compared to $285 million of net tax benefits in 2007.
    During 2008, the Company’s net tax expense was unfavorably
    impacted by: (i) non-cash tax charges to establish deferred
    tax asset valuation allowances, (ii) non-deductible
    goodwill impairment charges, (iii) non-deductible
    transaction related costs, (iv) a pension curtailment gain,
    (v) a gain on sale of property, plant and equipment,
    (vi) tax on the reduction of interest expense related to
    the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefit, and
    (vii) a gain on the extinguishment of a liability. The
    Company’s net tax expense was favorably impacted by:
    (i) a net reduction in unrecognized tax benefits,
    (ii) excess tax benefits on repatriations from high tax
    jurisdictions, and (iii) tax benefits on charges, including
    charges for: a software and silicon platform consolidation, a
    settlement relating to a purchase commitment, asset impairment
    charges, investment impairments and

reorganization of business charges. The Company’s effective
    tax rate, excluding these items, was 67%. The Company’s
    2008 effective tax rate of 67% is higher than the comparable
    2007 effective tax rate of 26%, primarily due to non-deductible
    foreign exchange and translation adjustment losses incurred in
    2008.

The Company’s net tax benefit for 2007 was favorably
    impacted by an increase in tax credits compared to 2006. The
    Company’s net tax benefit was also favorably impacted by:
    (i) the settlement of tax positions, (ii) tax
    incentives received, and (iii) reversal of deferred tax
    valuation allowances, and unfavorably impacted by:
    (i) adjustments to deferred taxes in

non-U.S. locations

due to enacted tax rate changes, (ii) an increase in
    unrecognized tax benefits, and (iii) a non-deductible
    IPR&D charge. The Company’s effective tax rate
    excluding the items described above and the tax impact of
    restructuring charges and asset impairments, was 26%.

Loss from
    Continuing Operations

The Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations
    before income taxes of $2.6 billion in 2008, compared with
    a net loss from continuing operations before income taxes of
    $390 million in 2007. After taxes, the Company incurred a
    net loss from continuing operations of $4.2 billion, or
    $1.87 per diluted share, in 2008, compared to a net loss from
    continuing operations of $105 million, or $0.05 per diluted
    share, in 2007.

The increase in the loss from continuing operations before
    income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributed
    to: (i) a $1.6 billion decrease in gross margin,
    (ii) a $1.4 billion increase in Other charges,
    (iii) a $398 million increase in charges classified as
    Other, as presented in Other income (expense), and (iv) a
    $43 million decrease in net interest income. These factors
    were partially offset by: (i) a $762 million decrease
    in SG&A expenses, (ii) a $320 million decrease in
    R&D expenditures, and (iii) a $32 million
    increase in gains on the sale of investments and businesses.

Results
    of Operations—2007 Compared to 2006

Net
    Sales

Net sales were $36.6 billion in 2007, down 15% compared to
    net sales of $42.8 billion in 2006. The decrease in net
    sales reflected a $9.4 billion decrease in net sales by the
    Mobile Devices segment, partially offset by a $2.3 billion
    increase in net sales by the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment and an $850 million increase in net sales by the
    Home and Networks Mobility segment. The 33% decrease in net
    sales in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by:
    (i) a 27% decrease in unit shipments, (ii) a 9%
    decrease in ASP, and (iii) decreased revenue from
    intellectual property and technology licensing. The 43% increase
    in net sales in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment was
    primarily driven by net sales from the Symbol business acquired
    in January 2007, as well as higher net sales in the government
    and public safety market due to strong demand in North America.
    The 9% increase in net sales in the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment was primarily driven by a 51% increase in unit shipments
    of digital entertainment devices, partially offset by lower net
    sales of wireless networks due primarily to lower demand for
    iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin was $10.0 billion, or 27.2% of net sales, in
    2007, compared to $12.7 billion, or 29.7% of net sales, in
    2006. The decrease in gross margin reflects decreases in gross
    margin in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility
    segments, partially offset by an increase in gross margin in the
    Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The decrease in gross
    margin in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily due to:
    (i) a 9% decrease in ASP, (ii) decreased income from
    intellectual property and technology licensing, (iii) a 27%
    decrease in unit shipments, and (iv) a $277 million
    charge for a legal settlement, partially offset by savings from
    supply chain cost-reduction initiatives. The decrease in gross
    margin in the Home and Networks segment was primarily due to:
    (i) continuing competitive pricing pressure in the market
    for GSM infrastructure equipment, and (ii) lower sales of
    iDEN infrastructure equipment, partially offset by increased
    sales of digital entertainment devices. The increase in gross
    margin in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment was
    primarily due to the 43% increase in net sales, driven by net
    sales from the Symbol business acquired in January 2007, as well
    as higher net sales in the government and public safety market
    due to strong demand in North America. Gross margin as a
    percentage of net sales decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006,
    reflecting decreases in all three of the Company’s business
    segments.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses increased 13% to $5.1 billion, or 13.9%
    of net sales, in 2007, compared to $4.5 billion, or 10.5%
    of net sales, in 2006. In 2007 compared to 2006, SG&A
    expenses increased in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Home
    and Networks Mobility segments and decreased in the Mobile
    Devices segment. The increases in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments were primarily
    due to expenses from recently acquired businesses, partially
    offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives. The decrease
    in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily due to lower
    marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives,
    partially offset by increased expenditures on information
    technology upgrades. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net
    sales increased in the Mobile Devices and Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segments and decreased in the Home and Networks
    Mobility segment.

Research
    and Development Expenditures

R&D expenditures increased 8% to $4.4 billion, or
    12.1% of net sales, in 2007, compared to $4.1 billion, or
    9.5% of net sales, in 2006. In 2007 compared to 2006, R&D
    expenditures increased in the Mobile Devices and Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segments and decreased in the Home and
    Networks Mobility segment. The increase in the Mobile Devices
    segment was primarily due to developmental engineering
    expenditures for new product development and investment in
    next-generation technologies, partially offset by savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. The increase in the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segment was primarily due to R&D
    expenditures incurred by recently acquired businesses, partially
    offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives. The decrease
    in the Home and Networks Mobility segment was primarily due to
    savings from cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by
    expenditures by recently acquired businesses and continued
    investment in digital entertainment devices and WiMAX. R&D
    expenditures as a percentage of net sales increased in the
    Mobile Devices segment and decreased in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments.

Other
    Charges (Income)

The Company recorded net charges of $984 million in Other
    charges (income) in 2007, compared to net charges of
    $25 million in 2006. The net charges in 2007 include:
    (i) $369 million of charges relating to the
    amortization of intangibles, (ii) $290 million of net
    reorganization of business charges, (iii) $140 million
    of charges for legal settlements and related insurance matters,
    (iv) $96 million of acquisition-related in-process
    research and development charges (“IPR&D”)
    relating to 2007 acquisitions, and (v) $89 million for
    asset impairment charges. The net charges in 2006 included:
    (i) $172 million of net reorganization of business
    charges, (ii) $100 million of charges relating to the
    amortization of intangibles, (iii) an $88 million
    charitable contribution to the Motorola Foundation of
    appreciated equity holdings in a third party,
    (iv) $50 million of legal reserves, and
    (v) $33 million of acquisition-related IPR&D
    charges relating to 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by
    $418 million of income for payments relating to the Telsim
    collection settlement.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $91 million in 2007, compared to
    net interest income of $326 million in 2006. Net interest
    income in 2007 included interest income of $456 million,
    partially offset by interest expense of $365 million. Net
    interest income in 2006 included interest income of
    $661 million, partially offset by interest expense of
    $335 million. The decrease in net interest income was
    primarily attributed to lower interest income due to the
    decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Fund
    balances during 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by
    higher interest rates.

Gains on
    Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
    $50 million in 2007, compared to gains of $41 million
    in 2006. In 2007, the net gain primarily reflected a gain of
    $34 million from the sale of the Company’s embedded
    communications computing group. In 2006, the net gain primarily
    reflected a gain of $141 million on the sale of the
    Company’s remaining shares in Telus Corporation, partially
    offset by a loss of $126 million on the sale of the
    Company’s remaining shares in Sprint Nextel Corporation
    (“Sprint Nextel”).



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Other

Income classified as Other, as presented in Other income
    (expense), was $22 million in 2007, compared to net income
    of $151 million in 2006. The net income in 2007 was
    primarily comprised of $97 million of foreign currency
    gains, partially offset by $44 million of
    other-than-temporary investment impairment charges. The net
    income in 2006 was primarily comprised of: (i) a
    $99 million net gain due to an increase in market value of
    a zero-cost collar derivative entered into to protect the value
    of the Company’s investment in Sprint Nextel, and
    (ii) $60 million of foreign currency gains, partially
    offset by $27 million of investment impairment charges.

Effective
    Tax Rate

The Company recorded $285 million of net tax benefits in
    2007, compared to $1.3 billion in net tax expense in 2006.
    The Company’s net tax benefit for 2007 was favorably
    impacted by an increase in tax credits compared to 2006. The
    Company’s net tax benefit was also favorably impacted by:
    (i) the settlement of tax positions, (ii) tax
    incentives received, and (iii) reversal of deferred tax
    valuation allowances, and unfavorably impacted by:
    (i) adjustments to deferred taxes in

non-U.S. locations

due to enacted tax rate changes, (ii) an increase in
    unrecognized tax benefits, and (iii) a non-deductible
    IPR&D charge. The Company’s effective tax rate for
    continuing operations, excluding the items described above and
    the tax impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments,
    was 26%.

The Company’s net tax expense of $1.3 billion in 2006
    was favorably impacted by $348 million of net tax benefits
    relating to: (i) the reduction of deferred tax asset
    valuation allowances, (ii) incremental tax benefits related
    to 2005 cash repatriations, (iii) favorable tax settlements
    reached with foreign jurisdictions, (iv) tax benefits for
    foreign earnings permanently reinvested, (v) contribution
    of appreciated investments to the Company’s charitable
    foundation and unfavorably impacted by: (i) the incurrence
    of non-deductible IPR&D charges, and
    (ii) restructuring charges in low tax jurisdictions. The
    effective tax rate for 2006 excluding these items was 36%.

The effective tax rate for continuing operations excluding
    identified items of 26% for 2007 is less than the comparable
    effective tax rate of 36% for 2006 due to an increase in tax
    credits in 2007 compared to 2006 and a change in the mix of
    income and loss by region.

Earnings
    (Loss) from Continuing Operations

The Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations
    before income taxes of $390 million in 2007, compared to
    earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of
    $4.6 billion in 2006. After taxes, the Company incurred a
    loss from continuing operations of $105 million, or $0.05
    per diluted share, in 2007, compared to earnings from continuing
    operations of $3.3 billion, or $1.30 per diluted share, in
    2006.

The decrease in earnings (loss) from continuing operations
    before income taxes in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily
    attributed to: (i) a $2.8 billion decrease in gross
    margin, driven by decreases in gross margin in the Mobile
    Devices and Home and Network Mobility segments, partially offset
    by an increase in gross margin in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions segment, (ii) a $959 million increase in
    Other charges (income), (iii) a $588 million increase
    in SG&A expenses, (iv) a $323 million increase in
    R&D expenditures, (v) a $235 million decrease in
    net interest income, and (vi) a $129 million decrease
    in income classified as Other, as presented in Other income
    (expense).

Reorganization
    of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
    “Severance Plan”), which permits the Company to offer
    eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
    and employment grade level in the event that employment is
    involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in-force

or restructuring. The Company recognizes termination benefits
    based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time
    that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably
    estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a
    restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs consist
    of future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other
    contractual terminations. At each reporting date, the Company
    evaluates its accruals for employee separation and exit costs to
    ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain
    circumstances, accruals are no longer needed because of
    efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees
    previously identified for separation resigned from the Company
    and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to
    circumstances not foreseen when the



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

original plans were initiated. In these cases, the Company
    reverses accruals through the consolidated statements of
    operations where the original charges were recorded when it is
    determined they are no longer needed.

The Company realized cost-saving benefits of approximately
    $103 million in 2008 from the plans that were initiated
    during 2008, representing: (i) $76 million of savings
    in R&D expenditures, (ii) $18 million of savings
    in SG&A expenses, and (iii) $9 million of savings
    in Costs of sales. Beyond 2008, the Company expects the
    reorganization plans initiated during 2008 to provide annualized
    cost savings of approximately $426 million, representing:
    (i) $222 million of savings in R&D expenditures,
    (ii) $93 million of savings in SG&A expenses, and
    (iii) $111 million of savings in Cost of sales.

    Charges

During 2008, the Company committed to implement various
    productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term,
    sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing
    operating costs. All three of the Company’s business
    segments, as well as corporate functions, are impacted by these
    plans, with the majority of the impact in the Mobile Devices
    segment. The employees affected are located in all regions. The
    Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of
    $334 million, including $86 million of charges in
    Costs of sales and $248 million of charges under Other
    charges in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. Included in the aggregate $334 million are
    charges of $324 million for employee separation costs,
    $66 million for exit costs and $9 million for fixed
    asset impairment charges, partially offset by $65 million
    of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

Exit
    Costs

At January 1, 2008, the Company had an accrual of
    $42 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2008 additional charges of $66 million
    are primarily related to: (i) the exit of leased facilities
    in the United Kingdom by the Mobile Devices segment, and
    (ii) the exit of leased facilities in Mexico by the Home
    and Networks Mobility segment. The adjustments of
    $1 million reflect $4 million of translation
    adjustments, partially offset by $3 million of reversals of
    accruals no longer needed. The $29 million used in 2008
    reflects cash payments. The remaining accrual of
    $80 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2008, represents future cash payments,
    primarily for lease termination obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2008, the Company had an accrual of
    $193 million for employee separation costs, representing
    the severance costs for approximately 2,800 employees. The
    2008 additional charges of $324 million represent severance
    costs for approximately an additional 5,800 employees, of
    which 2,300 are direct employees and 3,500 are indirect
    employees.

The adjustments of $60 million reflect $62 million of
    reversals of accruals no longer needed, partially offset by
    $2 million of translation adjustments. The $62 million
    of reversals represent previously accrued costs for
    approximately 600 employees.

During 2008, approximately 6,200 employees, of which 3,000
    were direct employees and 3,200 were indirect employees, were
    separated from the Company. The $287 million used in 2008
    reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
    remaining accrual of $170 million, which is included in
    Accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets at December 31, 2008, is expected to be paid to
    approximately 2,000 employees.

    Charges

During 2007, the Company committed to implement various
    productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term,
    sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing
    operating costs. All three of the Company’s business
    segments, as well as corporate functions, were impacted by these
    plans. The majority of the employees affected were located in
    North America and Europe. The Company recorded net
    reorganization of business charges of $394 million,
    including $104 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $290 million of charges under Other charges (income) in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Included
    in the aggregate $394 million were charges of
    $401 million for employee separation costs,
    $42 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
    $19 million for exit costs, offset by reversals for
    accruals no longer needed.

Exit
    Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $54 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2007 additional charges of $19 million
    are primarily related to the exit of certain activities and
    leased facilities in Ireland by the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment. The 2007 adjustments of $2 million represent
    accruals for exit costs established through purchase accounting
    for businesses acquired. The $33 million

used in 2007 reflects cash payments. The remaining accrual of
    $42 million, which was included in Accrued liabilities in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007, represented future cash payments for
    lease termination obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $104 million for employee separation costs, representing
    the severance costs for approximately 2,300 employees. The
    2007 additional charges of $401 million represent severance
    costs for approximately 6,700 employees, of which 2,400
    were direct employees and 4,300 were indirect employees.

The adjustments of $64 million reflect $68 million of
    reversals of accruals no longer needed, partially offset by
    $4 million of accruals for severance plans established
    through purchase accounting for businesses acquired. The
    $68 million of reversals represent previously accrued costs
    for 1,100 employees, and primarily relates to a strategic
    change regarding a plant closure and specific employees
    previously identified for separation who resigned from the
    Company and did not receive severance or who were redeployed due
    to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
    approved. The $4 million of accruals represents severance
    plans for approximately 200 employees established through
    purchase accounting for businesses acquired.

During 2007, approximately 5,300 employees, of which 1,700
    were direct employees and 3,600 were indirect employees, were
    separated from the Company. The $248 million used in 2007
    reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
    remaining accrual of $193 million was included in Accrued
    liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007.

    Charges

During 2006, the Company committed to implement various
    productivity improvement plans aimed principally at:
    (i) reducing costs in its supply-chain activities,
    (ii) integration synergies, and (iii) reducing other
    operating expenses, primarily relating to engineering and
    development costs. The Company recorded net reorganization of
    business charges of $213 million, including
    $41 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $172 million of charges under Other charges in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Included in
    the aggregate $213 million are charges of $191 million
    for employee separation costs, $15 million for fixed asset
    impairment charges and $30 million for exit costs,
    partially offset by $23 million of reversals for accruals
    no longer needed.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Exit
    Costs

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $50 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2006 additional charges of $30 million
    were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segment. The 2006 adjustments of
    $7 million represented reversals of accruals no longer
    needed. The $19 million used in 2006 reflects cash payments
    to lessors. The remaining accrual of $54 million, which was
    included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006,
    represented future cash payments for lease termination
    obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $53 million for employee separation costs, representing the
    severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees, of which
    1,100 were direct employees and 500 were indirect employees. The
    2006 additional charges of $191 million represented costs
    for an additional 3,900 employees, of which 1,700 were
    direct employees and 2,200 were indirect employees. The
    adjustments of $16 million represented reversals of
    accruals no longer needed.

During 2006, approximately 3,200 employees, of which 1,400
    were direct employees and 1,800 were indirect employees, were
    separated from the Company. The $124 million used in 2006
    reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
    remaining accrual of $104 million was included in Accrued
    liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2006.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
    Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are
    impacted by four key components: (i) current cash and cash
    equivalents, (ii) operating activities,
    (iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing
    activities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s cash and cash
    equivalents (which are highly-liquid investments with an
    original maturity of three months or less) were
    $3.1 billion, an increase of $312 million compared to
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007. At
    December 31, 2008, $311 million of this amount was
    held in the U.S. and $2.8 billion was held by the
    Company or its subsidiaries in other countries. The Company
    continues to analyze and review various repatriation strategies
    to continue to efficiently repatriate funds. At
    December 31, 2008, restricted cash was $343 million
    (including $279 million held outside of the U.S.), compared
    to $158 million (including $91 million held outside of
    the U.S.) at December 31, 2007.

The Company has approximately $2.9 billion of earnings in
    foreign subsidiaries that are not permanently reinvested and may
    be repatriated without additional U.S. federal income tax
    charges to the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations, given the U.S. federal tax provisions accrued
    on undistributed earnings and the utilization of available
    foreign tax credits. On a cash basis, these repatriations from
    the Company’s

non-U.S. subsidiaries

could require the payment of additional foreign taxes, which
    would be creditable against U.S. federal income taxes.
    While the Company regularly repatriates funds and a significant
    portion of the funds currently offshore can be repatriated
    quickly with minimal adverse financial impact, repatriation of
    some of these funds could be subject to delay for local country
    approvals and could have potential adverse tax consequences.

Operating
    Activities

The cash provided by operating activities from continuing
    operations in 2008 was $242 million, compared to
    $785 million provided in 2007, and $3.5 billion
    provided in 2006. The primary contributors to cash flow from
    operations in 2008 were: (i) a $1.9 billion decrease
    in accounts receivable, (ii) earnings from continuing
    operations (adjusted for non-cash items) of $1.0 billion,
    and (iii) a $466 million decrease in other current
    assets. These positive contributors to operating cash flow were
    partially offset by: (i) a $1.6 billion decrease in
    accounts payable and accrued liabilities, (ii) a
    $1.5 billion net cash outflow due to changes in other
    assets and liabilities, and (iii) a $54 million net
    cash outflow due to changes in inventories.

Accounts Receivable:

The Company’s net
    accounts receivable were $3.5 billion at December 31,
    2008, compared to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2007.
    The decrease in net accounts receivable reflects a substantial



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

decrease in accounts receivable in the Mobile Devices segment,
    primarily related to a significant decrease in net sales, and
    decreases in accounts receivable in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions and Home and Network Mobility segments. The
    Company’s businesses sell their products in a variety of
    markets throughout the world and payment terms can vary by
    market type and geographic location. Accordingly, the
    Company’s levels of net accounts receivable can be impacted
    by the timing and level of sales that are made by its various
    businesses and by the geographic locations in which those sales
    are made.

In addition, from time to time, the Company elects to sell
    accounts receivable to third parties. The Company’s levels
    of net accounts receivable can be impacted by the timing and
    amount of such sales, which can vary by period and can be
    impacted by numerous factors. Although the Company was not
    limited in its ability to sell receivables during 2008, the
    severe tightening in the credit markets and the ongoing global
    financial crisis may limit the Company’s ability to sell
    receivables in the future, particularly if the creditworthiness
    of our customers’ declines. As further described under
    “Sales of Receivables”, subsequent to the end of 2008,
    one of the Company’s committed receivables facilities
    expired and was not renewed.

Inventory:

The Company’s net inventory
    was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007. The decrease in net
    inventory reflects a decrease in net inventory in the Mobile
    Devices segment, partially offset by increases in net inventory
    in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Home and Networks
    Mobility segments. Inventory management continues to be an area
    of focus as the Company balances the need to maintain strategic
    inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to
    its customers against the risk of inventory excess and
    obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer
    spending requirements.

Accounts Payable:

The Company’s accounts
    payable were $3.2 billion at December 31, 2008,
    compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2007. The
    decrease in accounts payable reflects a decrease in accounts
    payable in the Mobile Devices segment, partially offset by
    increases in accounts payable in the Enterprise Mobility
    Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments. The Company
    buys products in a variety of markets throughout the world and
    payment terms can vary by market type and geographic location.
    Accordingly, the Company’s levels of accounts payable can
    be impacted by the timing and level of purchases made by its
    various businesses and by the geographic locations in which
    those purchases are made.

Reorganization of Businesses:

The Company has
    implemented reorganization of businesses plans. Cash payments
    for exit costs and employee separations in connection with a
    number of these plans were $316 million in 2008, as
    compared to $281 million in 2007. Of the $250 million
    reorganization of businesses accrual at December 31, 2008,
    $170 million relates to employee separation costs and is
    expected to be paid in 2009. The remaining $80 million in
    accruals relate to lease termination obligations that are
    expected to be paid over a number of years.

Benefit Plan Contributions:

The Company
    contributed $243 million to its U.S. pension plans
    during 2008, compared to $274 million contributed in 2007.
    The Company contributed $54 million to its

non-U.S. pension

plans during 2008, compared to $135 million contributed in
    2007. During 2009, the Company expects to make cash
    contributions of approximately $180 million to its
    U.S. pension plans and approximately $50 million to
    its

non-U.S. pension

plans.

The Company has amended its U.S. pension plans such that:
    (i) no participant shall accrue any benefits or additional
    benefits on or after March 1, 2009, and (ii) no
    compensation increases earned by a participant on or after
    March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any accrued benefit.

The Company contributed $16 million to its retiree health
    care plan in 2008, compared to $15 million in 2007, and
    expects to make no contributions to this plan in 2009.
    Retirement-related benefits are further discussed below in the
    “Significant Accounting Policies—Retirement-Related
    Benefits” section.

Investing
    Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s investing
    activities in 2008 include: (i) net proceeds from sales of
    Sigma Fund investments, (ii) capital expenditures,
    (iii) purchases of short-term investments,
    (iv) strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, other
    companies, and (v) proceeds from the sales of investments
    and businesses.

Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing
    operations was $794 million in 2008, compared to net cash
    provided of $2.4 billion in 2007 and net cash used of
    $1.4 billion in 2006. The $1.6 billion decrease in
    cash provided by investing activities in 2008 as compared to
    2007 was primarily due to: (i) a $6.0 billion decrease



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

in cash received from net sales of Sigma Fund investments, and
    (ii) a $318 million decrease in proceeds from the
    sales of investments and businesses, partially offset by:
    (i) a $4.3 billion decrease in cash used for
    acquisitions and investments, and (ii) a $380 million
    increase in sales of short-term investments.

Sigma Fund:

The Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries invest most of their U.S. dollar-denominated
    cash in a fund (the “Sigma Fund”) that is designed to
    provide investment returns similar to a money market fund. The
    Company received $853 million in net proceeds from sales of
    Sigma Fund investments in 2008, compared to $6.9 billion in
    net proceeds from sales of Sigma Fund investments in 2007 and
    $1.3 billion in net cash used to purchase Sigma Fund
    investments in 2006. The Sigma Fund aggregate balances were
    $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008 (including
    $2.4 billion held by the Company or its subsidiaries
    outside of the U.S.), compared to $5.2 billion at
    December 31, 2007 (including $3.5 billion held by the
    Company or its subsidiaries outside of the U.S.). While the
    Company regularly repatriates funds and a significant portion of
    the Sigma Fund investments currently offshore can be repatriated
    quickly and with minimal adverse financial impact, repatriation
    of some of these funds could be subject to delay and could have
    potential adverse tax consequences. The Company continues to
    analyze and review various repatriation strategies to continue
    to efficiently repatriate non-U.S. funds, including Sigma Fund
    investments.

The Sigma Fund portfolio is managed by four premier independent
    investment management firms. The investment guidelines of the
    Sigma Fund require that purchased investments must be in
    high-quality, investment grade (rated at least

A/A-1

by
    Standard & Poor’s or

A2/P-1

by
    Moody’s Investors Service), U.S. dollar-denominated
    debt obligations, including certificates of deposit, commercial
    paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and asset- and
    mortgage-backed securities. Under the Sigma Fund’s
    investment policies, except for debt obligations of the
    U.S. treasury and U.S. agencies, no more than 5% of
    the Sigma Fund portfolio is to consist of debt obligations of
    any one issuer. The Sigma Fund’s investment policies
    further require that floating rate investments must have a
    maturity at purchase date that does not exceed thirty-six months
    with an interest rate that is reset at least annually. The
    average interest rate reset of the investments held by the funds
    must be 120 days or less. The actual average interest rate
    reset of the portfolio (excluding cash and impaired securities)
    was 38 days and 39 days at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Investments in the Sigma Fund are carried at fair value. The
    Company primarily relies on valuation pricing models and broker
    quotes to determine the fair value of investments in the Sigma
    Fund. The valuation models are developed and maintained by
    third-party pricing services, and use a number of standard
    inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades,
    broker/dealer quotes where the counterparty is standing ready
    and able to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities,
    bids, offers and other reference data. For each asset class,
    quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and
    sector news may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $3.7 billion and
    $5.2 billion, respectively, of the Sigma Fund investments
    were classified as current in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. The weighted average maturity of the Sigma Fund
    investments classified as current was 5 months (excluding
    cash of $1.1 billion and impaired securities) at
    December 31, 2008, compared to 12 months (excluding
    cash of $16 million and impaired securities) at
    December 31, 2007.

The fair market value of investments in the Sigma Fund was
    $4.2 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company considers unrealized
    losses in the Sigma Fund to be temporary, as these losses have
    resulted primarily from the ongoing disruptions in the capital
    markets. On the securities for which the unrealized losses are
    considered temporary (excluding impaired securities), the
    Company believes it is probable that it will be able to collect
    all amounts it is owed according to their contractual terms,
    which may be at maturity. Temporary unrealized losses in the
    Sigma Fund were $101 million and $57 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

If it becomes probable the Company will not collect amounts it
    is owed on securities according to their contractual terms, the
    Company considers the security to be impaired and adjusts the
    cost basis of the security accordingly. During 2008 and 2007,
    impairment charges in the Sigma Fund were $186 million and
    $18 million, respectively. The impairment charges were
    primarily related to investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings,
    Inc., Washington Mutual, Inc., and Sigma Finance Corporation, an
    unrelated special investment vehicle managed by United
    Kingdom-based Gordian Knot, Limited.

Securities with a significant temporary unrealized loss and a
    maturity greater than 12 months and impaired securities
    have been classified as non-current in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2008,
    $466 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified
    as non-current, and the weighted average



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

maturity of the Sigma Fund investments classified as non-current
    (excluding impaired securities) was 16 months. At
    December 31, 2007, none of the Sigma Fund investments were
    classified as non-current.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized
    impairment charges from Sigma Fund investments in its
    consolidated statements of operations and temporary unrealized
    losses in Sigma Fund investments as a component of Non-owner
    changes to equity in the consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ equity. During the fourth quarter of 2008,
    the Company determined that temporary unrealized losses in Sigma
    Fund investments should also be recognized in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations, even though the related
    securities were not considered impaired. Because the Sigma Fund
    uses investment-company accounting in its stand-alone financial
    statements, it marks the investments in the fund to market and
    records all unrealized gains or losses in earnings, whether or
    not the related securities are considered impaired. The Company
    has determined that the stand-alone accounting policies of the
    Sigma Fund should be retained in its consolidated financial
    statements. Accordingly, the Company recorded $101 million
    of accumulated temporary unrealized losses in Sigma Fund
    investments in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations during the fourth quarter of 2008, which represents
    all of the temporary unrealized gains and losses that have
    accumulated in Sigma Fund investments as of December 31,
    2008. Portions of the temporary unrealized losses recognized in
    the fourth quarter of 2008 arose in periods prior to the fourth
    quarter of 2008 and should have been reflected in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations in the
    periods in which they arose. The Company has determined that the
    impact of the amounts that arose in prior periods is not
    material to the consolidated results of operations of those
    prior periods.

During 2008, the Company recorded total charges related to Sigma
    Fund investments, including temporary unrealized losses and
    impairment charges, of $287 million in its consolidated
    statement of operations. During 2007, the Company recorded total
    charges of $18 million, all of which were impairment
    charges, in its consolidated statements of operations. There
    were no temporary unrealized losses or impairment charges in the
    Sigma Fund investment portfolio during 2006.

The Company continuously assesses its cash needs and continues
    to believe that the balance of cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and investments in the Sigma Fund
    classified as current are more than adequate to meet its current
    operating requirements over the next twelve months. Therefore,
    the Company believes it is prudent to hold the $466 million
    of securities classified as non-current to maturity (or until
    they recover to cost), at which time we anticipate the
    securities will liquidate at cost.

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:

The
    Company used net cash for acquisitions and new investment
    activities of $282 million in 2008, compared to net cash
    used of $4.6 billion in 2007 and net cash used of
    $1.1 billion in 2006. During 2008, the Company:
    (i) acquired a controlling interest in Vertex Standard Co.
    Ltd. (part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment),
    (ii) acquired the assets related to digital cable set-top
    products of Zhejiang Dahua Digital Technology Co., LTD. and

    were $504 million in 2008, compared to $527 million in
    2007 and $649 million in 2006. The Company’s emphasis
    in making capital expenditures is to focus on strategic
    investments driven by customer demand and new design capability.

Sales of Investments and Businesses:

The
    Company received $93 million in proceeds from the sales of
    investments and businesses in 2008, compared to proceeds of
    $411 million in 2007 and proceeds of $2.0 billion in
    2006. The $93 million in proceeds in 2008 were primarily
    comprised of net proceeds received in connection with the sales
    of certain of the Company’s equity investments. The
    $411 million in proceeds in 2007 were primarily comprised
    of $346 million from the sale of the Company’s
    embedded communications computing business. During the first
    half of 2009, the Company expects to close on the sale of its
    biometrics business.

Short-Term Investments:

At December 31,
    2008, the Company had $225 million in short-term
    investments (which are highly-liquid fixed-income investments
    with an original maturity greater than three months but less
    than one year), compared to $612 million of short-term
    investments at December 31, 2007.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Investments:

In addition to available cash and
    cash equivalents, Sigma Fund balances (current and non-current)
    and short-term investments, the Company views its investments as
    an additional source of liquidity. The majority of these
    securities are available-for-sale and

cost-method

investments in technology companies. The fair market values of
    these securities are subject to substantial price volatility. In
    addition, the realizable value of these securities is subject to
    market and other conditions. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s available-for-sale equity securities portfolio
    had an approximate fair market value of $128 million, which
    represented a cost basis of $125 million and a net
    unrealized gain of $3 million. At December 31, 2007,
    the Company’s available-for-sale securities portfolio had
    an approximate fair market value of $333 million, which
    represented a cost basis of $372 million and a net
    unrealized loss of $39 million. At December 31, 2008
    and 2007, the Company’s cost-method investment portfolio
    had an approximate recorded value of $296 million and
    $414 million, respectively.

Financing
    Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s financing
    activities are: (i) payment of dividends,
    (ii) repayment and repurchase of debt, (iii) issuance
    of common stock, and (iv) purchases of the Company’s
    common stock under its share repurchase program.

Net cash used for financing activities from continuing
    operations was $645 million in 2008, compared to
    $3.3 billion of cash used in 2007 and $3.2 billion of
    cash used in 2006. Cash used for financing activities from
    continuing operations in 2008 was primarily:
    (i) $453 million of cash used to pay dividends,
    (ii) $225 million of cash used for the repayment and
    repurchase of debt, (iii) $138 million of cash used to
    purchase approximately 9.0 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock under the share repurchase program,
    all during the first quarter of 2008, (iv) $90 million
    in distributions to discontinued operations, and
    (v) $50 million of net cash used for the repayment of
    short-term borrowings, partially offset by:
    (i) $158 million of proceeds from the termination of
    interest rate swaps, and (ii) $145 million of net cash
    received from the issuance of common stock in connection with
    the Company’s employee stock option plans and employee
    stock purchase plan.

Net cash used for financing activities from continuing
    operations in 2007 was primarily: (i) $3.0 billion of
    cash used to purchase 171.2 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock under the share repurchase program,
    (ii) $1.4 billion of cash used for the repayment of
    maturing debt, (iii) $468 million of cash used to pay
    dividends, (iv) $242 million of net cash used for the
    repayment of commercial paper and short-term borrowings, and
    (v) $75 million in distributions to discontinued
    operations, partially offset by proceeds of:
    (i) $1.4 billion received from the issuance of
    long-term debt, (ii) $440 million received from the
    issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s
    employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan,
    and (iii) $50 million in excess tax benefits from
    share-based compensation.

Commercial Paper and Other Short-Term Debt:

At
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s outstanding notes
    payable and current portion of long-term debt was
    $92 million, compared to $332 million at
    December 31, 2007. In March 2008, the Company repaid, at
    maturity, the entire $114 million outstanding of
    6.50% Senior Notes due March 1, 2008. In October 2008,
    the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire $84 million
    outstanding of 5.80% Notes due October 15, 2008.

In November 2007, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire
    $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
    4.608% Senior Notes due November 16, 2007. In January
    2007, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire
    $118 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
    7.6% Notes due January 1, 2007.

Net cash used for the repayment of short-term borrowings was
    $50 million in 2008, compared to repayment of
    $242 million of commercial paper and short-term borrowings
    in 2007. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no
    commercial paper outstanding. The capital and credit markets
    have been experiencing extreme volatility and reduced liquidity
    for the past 12 months. Routine access to the commercial
    paper market has been limited for issuers like the Company,
    which have non-rated or split short-term ratings. If the Company
    were to issue commercial paper under the current market
    conditions, the funding costs the Company would have to pay to
    issue commercial paper would be much higher than historical
    levels, and the tenors would likely be limited to overnight
    borrowings.

Long-term Debt:

At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had outstanding long-term debt of $4.1 billion,
    compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2007.
    Although we believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient
    access to the capital markets, the current volatility and
    reduced liquidity in the financial markets may result in periods
    of time when access to the capital markets is limited for all
    issuers or issuers with credit ratings similar to the
    Company’s.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In December 2008, the Company completed the open market purchase
    of $42 million of the $400 million aggregate principal
    amount outstanding of its 7.50% Debentures due in 2025 (the
    “2025 Debentures”). The $42 million principal
    amount of 2025 Debentures was purchased for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $28 million, including
    accrued interest. During 2008, the Company recognized a gain of
    approximately $14 million related to this open market
    purchase in Other within Other income (expense) in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

In November 2007, the Company issued an aggregate face principal
    amount of: (i) $400 million of 5.375% Senior
    Notes due November 15, 2012, (ii) $400 million of
    6.00% Senior Notes due November 15, 2017, and
    (iii) $600 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due
    November 15, 2037.

The Company may from time to time seek to retire certain of its
    outstanding debt through open market cash purchases,
    privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such
    repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market
    conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements,
    contractual restrictions and other factors.

Share Repurchase Program:

During 2008, the
    Company paid an aggregate of $138 million, including
    transaction costs, to repurchase 9.0 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock at an average price of $15.32, all
    of which shares were repurchased during the first quarter.
    During 2007, the Company repurchased 171.2 million of its
    common shares at an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion, or an
    average cost of $17.74 per share. During 2006, the Company
    repurchased a total of 171.7 million of its common shares
    at an aggregate cost of $3.8 billion, or an average cost of
    $22.29 per share.

Through actions taken in July 2006 and March 2007, the Board of
    Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an aggregate
    amount of up to $7.5 billion of its outstanding shares of
    common stock over a period ending in June 2009. The timing and
    amount of future repurchases will be based on market and other
    conditions. As of December 31, 2008, the Company remained
    authorized to purchase an aggregate amount of up to
    $3.6 billion of additional shares under the current stock
    repurchase program. All repurchased shares have been retired.

Payment of Dividends:

The Company paid
    $453 million in cash dividends to holders of its common
    stock in 2008.  In January 2009, the Company paid
    $114 million in cash dividends that were declared in
    November 2008. In February 2009, the Company announced
    that its Board of Directors voted to suspend the declaration of
    quarterly dividends on the Company’s common stock. The
    Company does not currently expect to pay any additional cash
    dividends during the remainder of 2009.

Credit Ratings:

Three independent credit
    rating agencies, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s
    Investors Service (“Moody’s”), and
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), assign
    ratings to the Company’s short-term and long-term debt. The
    following chart reflects the current ratings assigned to the
    Company’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term
    debt and the Company’s commercial paper by each of these
    agencies.

Since the Company has investment grade ratings from Fitch and
    Moody’s and a non-investment grade rating from S&P, it
    is referred to as a “split rated credit”.

Credit
    Facilities

At December 31, 2008, the Company maintained a
    $2.0 billion five-year domestic syndicated revolving credit
    facility that matures in December 2011 (as amended, the

“5-Year

Credit Facility”), which is not utilized. In order



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

to borrow funds under the

5-Year

Credit Facility, the Company must be in compliance with various
    representations, conditions and covenants contained in the
    agreement, including a financial covenant relating to the ratio
    of total debt to adjusted EBITDA (the “Financial
    Covenant”). The Company was in compliance with the terms of
    the

5-Year

Credit Facility at December 31, 2008. If the Company
    borrows under the

5-Year

Credit Facility, it is required to remain in compliance with the
    terms of the agreement. Therefore, the amount of incremental
    liquidity available from borrowing under the 5-Year Credit
    Facility is contingent on the Company maintaining compliance
    with the Financial Covenant at the end of each quarter.

Events over the past several months, including recent failures
    and near failures of a number of large financial service
    companies, have made the capital markets increasingly volatile.
    The Company also has access to uncommitted non-U.S. credit
    facilities (“uncommitted facilities”), but in light of
    the state of the financial services industry and the
    Company’s current financial condition, the Company does not
    believe it is prudent to assume the same level of funding will
    be available under these facilities going forward as has been
    available historically.

Contractual
    Obligations and Other Purchase Commitments

Summarized in the table below are the Company’s obligations
    and commitments to make future payments under long-term debt
    obligations (assuming earliest possible exercise of put rights
    by holders), lease obligations, purchase obligations and tax

Amounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments.

Long-Term Debt Obligations:

The Company’s
    long-term debt obligations, including the current portion of
    long-term debt, totaled $4.0 billion at December 31,
    2008, compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2007. A
    table of all outstanding long-term debt securities can be found
    in Note 4, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” to the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Lease Obligations:

The Company owns most of
    its major facilities, but does lease certain office, factory and
    warehouse space, land, and information technology and other
    equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases. At
    December 31, 2008, future minimum lease obligations, net of
    minimum sublease rentals, totaled $770 million. Rental expense,
    net of sublease income, was $181 million in 2008,
    $231 million in 2007 and $241 million in 2006.

Purchase Obligations:

The Company has entered
    into agreements for the purchase of inventory, license of
    software, promotional activities, and research and development,
    which are firm commitments and are not cancelable. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s obligations in
    connection with these agreements run through 2013, and the total
    payments expected to be made under these agreements total
    $724 million during that period.

The Company enters into a number of arrangements for the
    sourcing of supplies and materials with take-or-pay obligations.
    The Company’s obligations with these suppliers run through
    2012 and total a minimum purchase obligation of
    $127 million during that period. The Company does not
    anticipate the cancellation of any of these agreements in the
    future and estimates that purchases from these suppliers will
    exceed the minimum obligations during the agreement periods.

Tax Obligations:

The Company has approximately
    $914 million of unrecognized income tax benefits relating
    to multiple tax jurisdictions and tax years. A significant
    portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, if settled, would not
    result in current or future payments as tax carry forwards are
    available for utilization. The Company anticipates that it is
    reasonably possible that $50 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits could be settled in 2009. However, it is not possible
    to estimate the timing of any other potential settlements.

Commitments Under Other Long-Term
    Agreements:

The Company has entered into certain
    long-term agreements to purchase software, components, supplies
    and materials from suppliers. Most of the agreements



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

extend for periods of one to three years (three to five years
    for software). However, generally these agreements do not
    obligate the Company to make any purchases, and many permit the
    Company to terminate the agreement with advance notice (usually
    ranging from 60 to 180 days). If the Company were to
    terminate these agreements, it generally would be liable for
    certain termination charges, typically based on work performed
    and supplier on-hand inventory and raw materials attributable to
    canceled orders. The Company’s liability would only arise
    in the event it terminates the agreements for reasons other than
    “cause.”

The Company outsources certain corporate functions, such as
    benefit administration and information technology-related
    services. These contracts are expected to expire in 2013. At
    December 31, 2008, the total remaining payments under these
    contracts are approximately $953 million over the remaining
    life of the contracts; however, these contracts can be
    terminated. Termination would result in a penalty substantially
    less than the remaining annual contract payments. The Company
    would also be required to find another source for these
    services, including the possibility of performing them in-house.

As is customary in bidding for and completing network
    infrastructure projects and pursuant to a practice the Company
    has followed for many years, the Company has a number of
    performance/bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety
    bonds outstanding (collectively, referred to as
    “Performance Bonds”), primarily relating to projects
    of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Home and Networks
    Mobility segments. These Performance Bonds normally have
    maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry
    as a way to give customers a convenient mechanism to seek
    resolution if a contractor does not satisfy performance
    requirements under a contract. A customer can draw on the
    Performance Bond only if the Company does not fulfill all terms
    of a project contract. If such an occasion occurred, the Company
    would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that
    issued the Performance Bond for the amounts paid. In its long
    history, it has been rare for the Company to have a Performance
    Bond drawn upon. At December 31, 2008, outstanding
    Performance Bonds totaled approximately $1.8 billion,
    compared to $1.7 billion at the end of 2007. As a result of
    the Company’s current credit ratings, issuers of these
    Performance Bonds may be less likely to provide Performance
    Bonds on the Company’s behalf in the future, unless the
    Company provides collateral. These limitations on issuance may
    apply to the renewal and extension of existing Performance
    Bonds, as well as the issuance of new Performance Bonds. Such
    collateral requirements could result in less liquidity for other
    operational needs. Also, as a result of the Company’s
    current credit ratings, there has been an increase in the cost
    of issuance of Performance Bonds.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

Under the
    definition contained in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of

Regulation S-K,

the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Long-term
    Customer Financing Commitments

Outstanding Commitments:

Certain purchasers of
    the Company’s infrastructure equipment continue to request
    that suppliers provide long-term financing, defined as financing
    with terms greater than one year, in connection with equipment
    purchases. These requests may include all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the equipment. However, the Company’s
    obligation to provide long-term financing is often conditioned
    on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by
    a reputable bank to support the purchaser’s credit or a
    pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the
    long-term receivables from the Company. The Company had
    outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third
    parties totaling $370 million and $610 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these amounts,
    $266 million and $454 million were supported by
    letters of credit or by bank commitments to purchase long-term
    receivables at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In
    response to the recent tightening in the credit markets, certain
    customers of the Company have requested financing in connection
    with equipment purchases, and these types of requests have
    increased in volume and scope. Motorola may increase its
    commitments to provide financing in light of these requests.

Guarantees of Third-Party Debt:

In addition to
    providing direct financing to certain equipment customers, the
    Company also assists customers in obtaining financing directly
    from banks and other sources to fund equipment purchases. The
    Company had committed to provide financial guarantees relating
    to customer financing totaling $43 million and
    $42 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively (including $23 million at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 relating to the sale of
    short-term receivables). Customer financing guarantees
    outstanding were $6 million and $3 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (including
    $4 million and $0 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term
    receivables).

Outstanding Long-Term Receivables:

The Company
    had net long-term receivables, less allowance for losses, of
    $162 million and $118 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively (net of allowances for losses of
    $7 million and $5 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively). These long-term receivables are
    generally



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

interest bearing, with interest rates ranging from 4% to 14%.
    Interest income recognized on long-term receivables for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $3 million, $7 million and $9 million,
    respectively.

Sales
    of Receivables

The Company sells accounts receivables and long-term receivables
    to third parties in transactions that qualify as
    “true-sales.” Certain of these accounts receivables
    and long-term receivables are sold to third parties on a
    one-time, non-recourse basis, while others are sold to third
    parties under committed facilities that involve contractual
    commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying
    receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
    facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be
    renewed on an annual basis. The Company may or may not retain
    the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and
    long-term receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2008, these committed
    facilities provided for up to $967 million to be
    outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
    up to $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion provided at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, $759 million of the Company’s
    committed facilities were utilized, compared to
    $497 million and $817 million utilized at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of the
    $967 million of committed facilities at December 31,
    2008, $532 million were primarily revolving facilities
    associated with the sale of accounts receivable (of which
    $497 million was utilized at December 31, 2008), and
    $435 million were primarily committed facilities associated
    with the sale of specific

long-term

financing transactions to a single customer (of which
    $262 million was utilized at December 31, 2008). In
    addition, before receivables can be sold under certain of the
    revolving committed facilities, they may need to meet
    contractual requirements, such as credit quality or insurability.

For many years the Company has utilized a number of receivables
    programs to sell a broadly-diversified group of accounts
    receivables to third parties. Certain of the accounts
    receivables were sold to a multi-seller commercial paper
    conduit. This program provided for up to $400 million of
    accounts receivables to be outstanding with the conduit at any
    time. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, this
    $400 million committed facility expired and the Company is
    negotiating a replacement facility under different terms. The
    Company is also negotiating an additional committed revolving
    receivable sales facility for European receivables, with the
    intent that the combined capacity of the two new facilities will
    be greater than the facility that expired. However, it is not
    certain when or if the Company will be successful in securing
    such facilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total
    accounts receivables and long-term receivables sold by the
    Company were $3.7 billion, $4.9 billion and
    $6.4 billion, respectively (including $3.4 billion,
    $4.7 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, of
    accounts receivables). As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    there were $1.0 billion and $978 million,
    respectively, of receivables outstanding under these programs
    for which the Company retained servicing obligations (including
    $621 million and $587 million, respectively, of
    accounts receivable).

Under certain receivables programs, the value of the receivables
    sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from independent
    insurance companies, less deductibles or self-insurance
    requirements under the policies (with the Company retaining
    credit exposure for the remaining portion). Although credit
    insurance remains generally available to the Company, it has
    become more expensive to obtain and often requires higher
    deductibles. The Company’s total credit exposure to
    outstanding short-term receivables that have been sold was
    $23 million at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.
    Reserves of $4 million and $1 million were recorded
    for potential losses at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Adequate
    Internal Funding Resources

The Company believes that it has adequate internal resources
    available to fund expected working capital and capital
    expenditure requirements for the next twelve months as supported
    by the level of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments
    and Sigma Fund balances in the U.S. and the ability to
    repatriate cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    Sigma Fund balances from foreign jurisdictions.

Other
    Contingencies

Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying
    Contract Value:

In certain circumstances, our
    businesses may enter into contracts with customers pursuant to
    which the damages that could be claimed by the other party for
    failed performance might exceed the revenue the Company receives
    from the contract. Contracts



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

with these types of uncapped damage provisions are fairly rare,
    but individual contracts could still represent meaningful risk.
    There is a possibility that a damage claim by a counterparty to
    one of these contracts could result in expenses to the Company
    that are far in excess of the revenue received from the
    counterparty in connection with the contract.

Indemnification Provisions:

In addition, the
    Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from
    the breach of general warranties contained in certain
    commercial, intellectual property and divestiture agreements.
    Historically, the Company has not made significant payments
    under these agreements, nor have there been significant claims
    asserted against the Company. However, there is an increasing
    risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the
    current legal climate. In indemnification cases, payment by the
    Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim
    pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract,
    which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the
    other party’s claims. Further, the Company’s
    obligations under these agreements for indemnification based on
    breach of representations and warranties are generally limited
    in terms of duration, typically not more than 24 months,
    and for amounts not in excess of the contract value, and in some
    instances the Company may have recourse against third parties
    for certain payments made by the Company.

Legal Matters:

The Company is a defendant in
    various lawsuits, claims and actions, which arise in the normal
    course of business. These include actions relating to products,
    contracts and securities, as well as matters initiated by third
    parties or Motorola relating to infringements of patents,
    violations of licensing arrangements and other intellectual
    property-related matters. In the opinion of management, the
    ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, liquidity or results of operations.

Segment
    Results—2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, the segment’s net sales were $12.1 billion, a
    decrease of 36% compared to net sales of $19.0 billion in
    2007. The 36% decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a
    37% decrease in unit shipments. The segment’s net sales
    were negatively impacted by the segment’s limited product
    offerings in critical market segments, particularly 3G products,
    including smartphones, as well as very low-tier products. In
    addition, the segment’s net sales were impacted by the
    global economic downturn in the second half of 2008, which
    resulted in the slowing of end user demand. On a product
    technology basis, net sales decreased substantially for GSM and
    CDMA technologies and, to a lesser extent, decreased for iDEN
    and 3G technologies. On a geographic basis, net sales decreased
    substantially in North America, the Europe, Middle East and
    Africa region (“EMEA”) and Asia and, to a lesser
    extent, decreased in Latin America.

The segment incurred an operating loss of $2.2 billion in
    2008, compared to an operating loss of $1.2 billion in
    2007. The increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a
    decrease in gross margin, driven by: (i) a 36% decrease in
    net sales, (ii) excess inventory and other related charges
    of $370 million in 2008 due to a decision to



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

consolidate software and silicon platforms, and (iii) a
    $150 million charge in 2008 related to the settlement of a
    purchase commitment, partially offset by: (i) the absence in
    2008 of a $277 million charge for a legal settlement
    recorded in 2007, and (ii) savings from supply chain
    cost-reduction initiatives. The decrease in gross margin was
    partially offset by decreases in: (i) selling, general and
    administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, primarily due
    to lower marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction
    initiatives, and (ii) research and development
    (“R&D”) expenditures, reflecting savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. The segment’s industry
    typically experiences short life cycles for new products.
    Therefore, it is vital to the segment’s success that new,
    compelling products are constantly introduced. Accordingly, a
    strong commitment to R&D is required to fuel long-term
    growth. As a percentage of net sales in 2008 as compared to
    2007, R&D and SG&A expenses increased and gross margin
    decreased.

The segment’s backlog was $290 million at
    December 31, 2008, compared to $647 million at
    December 31, 2007. This decrease in backlog is primarily
    due to a decline in customer demand, primarily driven by the
    segment’s limited product portfolio, as well as the global
    economic downturn.

Unit shipments in 2008 were 100.1 million units, a 37%
    decrease compared to shipments of 159.1 million units in
    2007. The overall decrease reflects decreased unit shipments of
    products for all technologies. For the full year 2008, unit
    shipments decreased substantially in North America, EMEA and
    Asia and, to a lesser extent, decreased in Latin America.
    Although unit shipments by the segment decreased in 2008, total
    unit shipments in the worldwide handset market increased by
    approximately 5%. The segment estimates its worldwide market
    share to be approximately 8% in 2008, a decrease of
    approximately 6 percentage points versus 2007, reflecting a
    significant decline in market share in North America.

In 2008, average selling price (“ASP”) was flat
    compared to 2007. By comparison, ASP decreased approximately 9%
    in 2007 and 11% in 2006. ASP is impacted by numerous factors,
    including product mix, market conditions and competitive product
    offerings, and ASP trends often vary over time.

The segment has several large customers located throughout the
    world. In 2008, aggregate net sales to the segment’s five
    largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of the
    segment’s net sales. Besides selling directly to carriers
    and operators, the segment also sells products through a variety
    of third-party distributors and retailers, which account for
    approximately 24% of the segment’s net sales. The loss of
    any of the segment’s key customers could have a significant
    impact on the segment’s business.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
    largest individual market, many of our customers and 56% of our
    segment’s 2008 net sales were outside the
    U.S. The largest of these international markets are Brazil,
    China and Mexico.

As the segment’s revenue transactions are largely
    denominated in local currencies, we are impacted by the
    weakening in the value of these local currencies against the
    U.S. dollar. A number of our more significant international
    markets, particularly in Latin America, were impacted by this
    trend in late 2008. We anticipate volatility in the currency
    markets to continue in 2009.

Segment
    Results—2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, the segment’s net sales were $19.0 billion, a
    decrease of 33% compared to net sales of $28.4 billion in
    2006. The 33% decrease in net sales was primarily driven by:
    (i) a 27% decrease in unit shipments, (ii) a 9%
    decrease in ASP, and (iii) decreased revenue from
    intellectual property and technology licensing. The
    segment’s product sales were negatively impacted by
    limitations in the segment’s product portfolio, including
    3G products and products for the Multimedia and Mass Market
    product segments, as well as an aging product portfolio. On a
    product technology basis, net sales of products for:
    (i) GSM technology decreased substantially, (ii) iDEN
    and CDMA technologies decreased, and (iii) 3G technologies
    increased slightly. On a geographic basis, net sales decreased
    in all regions, and decreased substantially in Asia and EMEA.
    The substantial decrease in Asia, particularly in China, as well
    as in other emerging markets, was due to lower demand for our
    products as a result of an aging product portfolio and increased
    industry-wide competition. The substantial decrease in EMEA was
    due to limitations in our product portfolio, particularly 3G
    products.

The segment incurred an operating loss of $1.2 billion in
    2007, compared to operating earnings of $2.7 billion in
    2006. The operating loss was primarily due to a decrease in
    gross margin, driven by: (i) a 9% decrease in ASP,
    (ii) decreased income from intellectual property and
    technology licensing, (iii) a 27% decrease in unit
    shipments, and (iv) a $277 million charge for a legal
    settlement, partially offset by savings from supply chain
    cost-reduction initiatives. R&D expenditures increased,
    driven by increased expenditures on developmental engineering
    for new



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

products and software, as well as ongoing investment in
    next-generation technologies, partially offset by savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. Reorganization of business charges
    increased due to employee severance costs and expenses related
    to the exit of a facility. SG&A expenses decreased,
    primarily due to lower marketing expenses and savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by increased
    expenditures on information technology upgrades. As a percentage
    of net sales in 2007 as compared to 2006, gross margin and
    operating margin decreased, and SG&A expenses and R&D
    expenditures increased.

The segment’s backlog was $647 million at
    December 31, 2007, compared to $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2006. This decrease in backlog was primarily
    due to a decline in customer demand driven by the segment’s
    limited product portfolio.

The segment shipped 159.1 million units in 2007, a 27%
    decrease compared to shipments of 217.4 million units in
    2006. The overall decrease reflects decreased unit shipments of
    products for all technologies. For the full year 2007, unit
    shipments: (i) decreased substantially in Asia and EMEA,
    (ii) decreased in North America, and (iii) increased
    in Latin America. Although unit shipments by the segment
    decreased in 2007, total unit shipments in the worldwide handset
    market increased by approximately 16%. The segment estimates its
    worldwide market share was approximately 14% for the full year
    2007, a decrease of approximately 8 percentage points
    versus full year 2006.

In 2007, ASP decreased approximately 9% compared to 2006. The
    overall decrease in ASP was driven primarily by changes in the
    product-tier and geographic mix of sales. By comparison, ASP
    decreased approximately 11% in 2006 and 10% in 2005.

The segment has several large customers located throughout the
    world.  In 2007, aggregate net sales to the segment’s five
    largest customers accounted for approximately 42% of the
    segment’s net sales. Besides selling directly to carriers
    and operators, the segment also sells products through a variety
    of third-party distributors and retailers, which account for
    approximately 33% of the segment’s net sales. The largest
    of these distributors was Brightstar Corporation.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
    largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
    54% of our segment’s 2007 net sales, were outside the
    U.S. The largest of these international markets were
    Brazil, China and Mexico.

Segment
    Results—2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, the segment’s net sales increased 1% to
    $10.1 billion, compared to $10.0 billion in 2007. The
    1% increase in net sales primarily reflects a 16% increase in
    net sales in the home business, partially offset by an 11%
    decrease in net sales in the networks business. The 16% increase
    in net sales in the home business is primarily driven by a 17%
    increase in net sales of digital entertainment devices,
    reflecting a 19% increase in unit shipments to 18.0 million
    units, partially offset by lower ASP due to product mix shift
    and pricing pressure. The 11% decrease in net sales in the
    networks business was primarily driven by: (i) the absence
    of net sales by the embedded communication computing group
    (“ECC”) that was divested at the end of 2007, and
    (ii) lower net sales of iDEN, GSM and CDMA infrastructure
    equipment, partially offset by higher net sales of UMTS
    infrastructure equipment.

On a geographic basis, the 1% increase in net sales was
    primarily driven by higher net sales in Latin America and Asia,
    partially offset by lower net sales in North America. The
    increase in net sales in Latin America was



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

primarily due to higher net sales in the home business. The
    increase in net sales in Asia was primarily driven by higher net
    sales of UMTS and CDMA infrastructure equipment, partially
    offset by lower net sales of GSM infrastructure. The decrease in
    net sales in North America was primarily due to lower net sales
    of iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment, partially offset by
    higher net sales in the home business. Net sales in
    North America accounted for approximately 50% of the
    segment’s total net sales in 2008, compared to
    approximately 52% of the segment’s total net sales in 2007.
    The regional shift in 2008 as compared to 2007 reflects a 5%
    aggregate growth in net sales outside of North America and a 3%
    decline in net sales in North America.

The segment had operating earnings of $918 million in 2008,
    compared to operating earnings of $709 million in 2007. The
    increase in operating earnings was primarily due to:
    (i) decreases in both SG&A and R&D expenditures,
    primarily related to savings from cost-reduction initiatives,
    and (ii) a decrease in reorganization of business charges,
    relating primarily to lower employee severance costs. These
    factors were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin,
    primarily due to: (i) an unfavorable product mix, and (ii) the
    absence of net sales by ECC. As a percentage of net sales in
    2008 as compared to 2007, gross margin, SG&A expenses and
    R&D expenditures all decreased and operating margin
    increased. The segment’s gross margin percentages differ
    among its services, software and equipment products.
    Accordingly, the aggregate gross margin of the segment can
    fluctuate from period to period depending upon the relative mix
    of sales in the given period.

Due to the nature of the segment’s business, many of the
    agreements we enter into are long-term contracts that require
    sizeable investments by our customers. The segment is dependent
    upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of
    its sales. In 2008, sales to the segment’s top five
    customers represented approximately 45% of the segment’s
    net sales. The loss of one of these major customers could have a
    significant impact on the segment’s business and, because
    many of these contracts are long-term in nature, could impact
    revenue and earnings over several quarters. The segment’s
    backlog was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2008,
    compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007.

In the home business, demand for the segment’s products
    depends primarily on the level of capital spending by broadband
    operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their
    communications systems, and for offering advanced services.
    Additionally, in 2008, our digital video customers significantly
    increased their purchases of the segment’s products and
    services, primarily due to increased demand for digital
    entertainment devices, particularly IP and HD/DVR devices.

In the networks business, the segment has been a long-standing
    proponent of WiMAX and is now commercially deploying this
    technology to multiple customers on a global basis.  The segment
    is developing infrastructure equipment utilizing LTE technology.
    LTE has widespread industry support, not only from current
    GSM/UMTS operators, but also from CDMA/EV-DO based carriers.

In February 2008, the segment acquired the assets related to
    digital cable set-top products of Zhejiang Dahua Digital
    Technology Co., LTD and Hangzhou Image Silicon, (known
    collectively as Dahua Digital), a developer, manufacturer and
    marketer of cable set-tops and related low cost integrated
    circuits for the emerging Chinese cable business. The
    acquisition helps the segment strengthen its position in the
    rapidly growing cable market in China.

Segment
    Results—2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, the segment’s net sales increased 9% to
    $10.0 billion, compared to $9.2 billion in 2006. The
    9% increase in net sales reflects a 27% increase in net sales in
    the home business, partially offset by a 1% decrease in net
    sales in the network business. The 27% increase in net sales in
    the home business was primarily driven by: (i) a 43%
    increase in net sales of digital entertainment devices,
    reflecting a 50% increase in unit shipments to 15.1 million
    units, partially offset by a decline in ASP due to a product mix
    shift towards all-digital set-tops, and (ii) a 6% increase
    in net sales of broadband gateways, primarily due to higher net
    sales of data modems, driven by net sales from the Netopia, Inc.
    business acquired in February 2007. The 1% decrease in net sales
    in the networks business was primarily driven by lower net sales
    of iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment, partially offset by
    higher net sales of GSM infrastructure equipment, despite
    competitive pricing pressure.

On a geographic basis, the 9% increase in net sales reflects
    higher net sales in all geographic regions. The increase in net
    sales in North America was driven primarily by higher sales of
    digital entertainment devices, partially offset by lower net
    sales of iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment. The increase in
    net sales in Asia was primarily due to higher net sales of GSM
    infrastructure equipment, partially offset by lower net sales of
    CDMA infrastructure equipment. The increase in net sales in EMEA
    was primarily due to higher net sales of GSM infrastructure
    equipment, partially offset by lower demand for iDEN and CDMA
    infrastructure equipment. Net sales in North America continued
    to comprise a significant portion of the segment’s
    business, accounting for 52% of the segment’s total net
    sales in 2007, compared to 56% of the segment’s total net
    sales in 2006.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The segment had operating earnings of $709 million in 2007,
    compared to operating earnings of $787 million in 2006. The
    decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease
    in gross margin, driven by: (i) lower net sales of iDEN
    infrastructure equipment, and (ii) continued competitive
    pricing pressure in the market for GSM infrastructure equipment,
    partially offset by: (i) increased net sales of digital
    entertainment devices, and (ii) the reversal of
    reorganization of business accruals recorded in 2006 relating to
    employee severance which were no longer needed. SG&A
    expenses increased primarily due to the expenses from recently
    acquired businesses, partially offset by savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. R&D expenditures decreased
    primarily due to savings from cost-reduction initiatives,
    partially offset by expenditures by recently acquired businesses
    and continued investment in digital entertainment devices and
    WiMAX. As a percentage of net sales in 2007 as compared to 2006,
    gross margin, SG&A expenses, R&D expenditures and
    operating margin all decreased.

In 2007, sales to the segment’s top five customers
    represented approximately 43% of the segment’s net sales.
    The segment’s backlog was $2.6 billion at
    December 31, 2007, compared to $3.2 billion at
    December 31, 2006.

In the home business, demand for the segment’s products
    depends primarily on the level of capital spending by broadband
    operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their
    communications systems, and for offering advanced services.
    During the second quarter of 2007, the segment began shipping
    digital set-tops that support the Federal Communications
    Commission (“FCC”) — mandated separable
    security requirement. FCC regulations mandating the separation
    of security functionality from set-tops went into effect on
    July 1, 2007. As a result of these regulations, many cable
    service providers accelerated their purchases of set-tops in the
    first half of 2007. Additionally, in 2007, our digital video
    customers significantly increased their purchases of the
    segment’s products and services, primarily due to increased
    demand for digital entertainment devices, particularly HD/DVR
    devices.

During 2007, the segment completed the acquisitions of:
    (i) Netopia, Inc., a broadband equipment provider for DSL
    customers, which allows for phone, TV and fast Internet
    connections, (ii) Tut Systems, Inc., a leading developer of
    edge routing and video encoders, (iii) Modulus Video, Inc.,
    a provider of MPEG-4 Advanced Coding compression systems
    designed for delivery of high-value video content in IP set-top
    devices for the digital video, broadcast and satellite
    marketplaces, (iv) Terayon Communication Systems, Inc., a
    provider of real-time digital video networking applications to
    cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers
    worldwide, and (v) Leapstone Systems, Inc., a provider of
    intelligent multimedia service delivery and content management
    applications to networks operators. These acquisitions enhance
    our ability to provide complete end-to-end systems for the
    delivery of advanced video, voice and data services. In December
    2007, Motorola completed the sale of ECC to Emerson for
    $346 million in cash.

Segment
    Results—2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, the segment’s net sales increased 5% to
    $8.1 billion, compared to $7.7 billion in 2007. The 5%
    increase in net sales reflects an 8% increase in net sales to
    the government and public safety market, partially offset by a
    2% decrease in net sales to the commercial enterprise market.
    The increase in net sales to the government and public safety
    market was primarily driven by: (i) increased net sales
    outside of North America, and (ii) the net sales generated
    by Vertex Standard Co., Ltd., a business the Company acquired a
    controlling interest of in January 2008, partially offset by
    lower net sales in North America. On a geographic basis, the
    segment’s net sales were higher in EMEA, Asia and Latin
    America and lower in North America.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The segment had operating earnings of $1.5 billion in 2008,
    compared to operating earnings of $1.2 billion in 2007. The
    increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase
    in gross margin, driven by: (i) the 5% increase in net
    sales, (ii) a favorable product mix, (iii) the absence
    in 2008 of an inventory-related charge in connection with the
    acquisition of Symbol Technologies, Inc. (“Symbol”)
    during the first quarter of 2007, and (iv) a decrease in
    SG&A expenses, primarily related to savings from
    cost-reduction initiatives. The increase in gross margin was
    partially offset by increased R&D expenditures, primarily
    due to developmental engineering expenditures for new product
    development and investment in next-generation technologies. As a
    percentage of net sales in 2008 as compared to 2007, gross
    margin, R&D expenditures and operating margin increased,
    and SG&A expenses decreased.

Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant
    portion of the segment’s business, accounting for
    approximately 57% of the segment’s net sales in 2008,
    compared to approximately 62% in 2007. The regional shift in
    2008 as compared to 2007 reflects 19% growth in net sales
    outside of North America and a 4% decline in net sales in North
    America. Our products and services are sold worldwide to a
    diverse set of customers, including customers involved in:
    government and public safety (police, fire, emergency management
    services), military, utilities, retail, transportation and
    logistics, manufacturing, wholesale and distribution, and
    healthcare. The segment’s backlog was $2.4 billion at
    December 31, 2008, compared to $2.3 billion at
    December 31, 2007.

In the government and public safety market, we see a continued
    emphasis on mission-critical systems as we face ongoing natural
    disasters and world-wide terrorist-related events. We have led
    new innovations in the market this past year, through the
    continued success of our MOTOTRBO line and the introduction of
    the
    APX

family of products, an industry first in many features. While
    spending by the segment’s government and public safety
    market customers is affected by government budgets at the
    national, state and local levels, we have seen the scope and
    size of systems requested by some of the segment’s
    customers continue to increase. We have had many significant
    wins across the globe, such as several city and state-wide
    communications systems in the United States, several competitive
    TETRA system wins with major international airport customers in
    Europe and Asia, and our largest award ever within Asia for the
    digital migration of the Royal Malaysian Police. These larger
    systems are more complex and include a wide range of
    capabilities that our technological innovations are able to
    provide.

We are also a market leader within the commercial enterprise
    markets. We continue to help our customers move information
    where it needs to be, as in the product launch of the MC75, an
    enterprise digital assistant targeted to the mobile workforce.

During 2008, the segment also: (i) acquired a controlling
    interest in Vertex Standard Co., Ltd., a global provider of
    two-way radio communication solutions, and (ii) completed
    the acquisition of AirDefense Inc., a leading wireless local
    area network (WLAN) security provider.

Segment
    Results—2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, the segment’s net sales increased 43% to
    $7.7 billion, compared to $5.4 billion in 2006. The
    43% increase in net sales was primarily due to increased net
    sales in the commercial enterprise market, driven by the net
    sales from the Symbol business acquired in January 2007. Net
    sales in the government and public safety market increased 6%,
    primarily due to strong demand in North America. On a geographic
    basis, net sales increased in all regions.

The segment had operating earnings of $1.2 billion in 2007,
    compared to operating earnings of $958 million in 2006. The
    increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase
    in gross margin in both: (i) the commercial enterprise
    market, driven by net sales from the Symbol business acquired in
    January 2007, and (ii) the government and public safety
    market, driven by strong net sales in North America. This
    improvement in gross margin was partially offset by: (i) an
    inventory-related charge in connection with the acquisition of
    Symbol, and (ii) increases in SG&A and R&D
    expenses, primarily due to expenses from recently acquired
    businesses, partially offset by savings from cost-reduction
    initiatives. As a percentage of net sales in 2007 as compared
    2006, gross margin, R&D expenditures and operating margin
    decreased, and SG&A expenses increased.

Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant
    portion of the segment’s business, accounting for
    approximately 62% of the segment’s net sales in 2007,
    compared to approximately 63% in 2006. The segment’s
    backlog was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007,
    compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006.

During 2007, the segment completed the acquisition of:
    (i) Symbol Technologies, Inc., a leader in designing,
    developing, manufacturing and servicing products and systems
    used in end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions, and
    (ii) Good Technology, Inc., a provider of enterprise mobile
    computing software and services.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
    experience, current economic and industry conditions and on
    various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments
    about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
    readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
    Management believes the following significant accounting
    policies require significant judgment and estimates:

— Revenue recognition

— Inventory valuation

— Income taxes

— Valuation of Sigma Fund and investment portfolios

— Restructuring activities

— Retirement-related benefits

— Valuation and recoverability of goodwill and
    long-lived assets

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s arrangements with customers may differ in
    nature and complexity and may contain multiple deliverables,
    including products, equipment, services and software that may be
    essential to the functionality of the other deliverables,
    requiring the Company to make judgments and estimates in
    recognizing revenues.

Product and equipment sales may contain discounts, price
    protection, return provisions and other customer incentives. The
    Company’s recorded revenues are reduced by allowances for
    these items at the time the sales are recorded. The allowances
    are based on management’s best estimate of the amount of
    allowances that the customer will ultimately earn and was based
    on historical experience taking into account the type of
    products sold, the type of customer and the type of transaction
    specific to each arrangement. Where customer incentives cannot
    be reliably estimated, the Company recognizes revenue at the
    time the product sells through the distribution channel to the
    end customer.

The Company’s long-term contracts may involve the design,
    engineering, manufacturing and installation of wireless and
    wireline networks and two-way radio voice and data systems.
    These systems are designed to meet specific customer
    requirements and specifications and generally require extended
    periods to complete. If the Company can reliably estimate
    revenues and contract costs and the technology is considered
    proven, revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion
    method as work progresses towards completion; otherwise, the
    revenue is recognized under the completed contract method.
    Estimates of contract revenues, contract costs and progress
    towards completion are based on estimates that consider
    historical experience and other factors believed to be relevant
    under the circumstances. Management regularly reviews these
    estimates and considers the impact of recurring business risks
    and uncertainties inherent in the contracts, such as system
    performance and implementation delays due to factors within or
    outside the control of management.

Generally, multiple element arrangements are separated into
    specific accounting units when: (i) delivered elements have
    value to the customer on a stand-alone basis,
    (ii) objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists
    for the undelivered element(s), and (iii) delivery of the
    undelivered element(s) is probable and substantially within the
    control of the Company. Total arrangement consideration is
    allocated to the separate accounting units based on their
    relative fair values (if the fair value of each accounting unit
    is known) or using the residual method (if the fair value of the
    undelivered element(s) is known). Revenue is recognized for a
    separate accounting unit when the revenue recognition criteria
    are met for that unit. In certain situations, judgment is
    required in determining both the number of accounting units and
    fair value of the elements, although generally the fair value of
    an element can be objectively determined if the Company sells
    the element on a stand-alone basis. Multiple element
    arrangements that include software are separated into more than
    one unit of accounting when the following criteria are met:
    (i) the functionality of the delivered element(s) is not
    dependent on the undelivered element(s), (ii) there is
    vendor-



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered
    element(s), and (iii) general revenue recognition criteria
    related to the delivered element(s) have been met.

Changes in cost estimates and the fair values of certain
    deliverables could negatively impact the Company’s
    operating results. In addition, unforeseen conditions could
    arise over the contract term that may have a significant impact
    on operating results.

Inventory
    Valuation

The Company records valuation reserves on its inventory for
    estimated excess or obsolescence. The amount of the reserve is
    equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and
    the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
    demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management
    in each segment performs an analysis of the underlying inventory
    to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence.
    Management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate
    reserves based on this analysis. In addition, the Company
    adjusts the carrying value of inventory if the current market
    value of that inventory is below its cost.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Inventories consisted of the
    following:

The Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory
    levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its
    customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to
    rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As
    reflected above, the Company’s inventory reserves
    represented 22% of the gross inventory balance at
    December 31, 2008, compared to 12% of the gross inventory
    balance at December 31, 2007. The increase in the inventory
    reserves was primarily due to the Company recording a charge of
    $291 million for excess inventory due to a decision to
    consolidate software and silicon platforms in the Mobile Devices
    segment in 2008. The Company has inventory reserves for pending
    cancellations of product lines due to technology changes,
    long-life cycle products, lifetime buys at the end of supplier
    production runs, business exits, and a shift of production to
    outsourcing.

If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, additional inventory
    writedowns may be required.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income
    and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various
    jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated
    effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company’s
    quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a
    significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to
    be recognized, in the Company’s quarterly operating
    results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately
    calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or
    discrete item. The Company considers the resolution of
    prior-year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is
    required in determining the Company’s effective tax rate
    and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes
    reserves when it is more likely than not that the Company will
    not realize the full tax benefit of the position. The Company
    adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and
    circumstances.

Tax regulations may require items of income and expense to be
    included in a tax return in different periods than the items are
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result,
    the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial
    statements may be different than the tax rate reported in the
    income tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such
    as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some
    are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
    Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that
    can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in
    future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax
    benefit in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax
    liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the
    consolidated financial



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for
    which the Company has already taken a deduction on an income tax
    return, but has not yet recognized in the consolidated financial
    statements.

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires that
    deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted
    tax rates for the effect of the temporary differences between
    the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The
    Company makes estimates and judgments with regard to the
    calculation of certain income tax assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets be
    reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration
    of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
    portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
    Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively
    verified.

The Company evaluates deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis
    to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering
    available evidence, including historical and projected taxable
    income and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and
    feasible. As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s U.S
    operations had generated two consecutive years of pre-tax
    losses, which are attributable to the Mobile Devices segment.
    During 2007 and 2008, the Home and Networks Mobility and
    Enterprise Mobility Solution businesses (collectively referred
    to as the “Broadband Mobility Solutions business”)
    were profitable in the U.S. and worldwide. Because of the
    2007 and 2008 losses at Mobile Devices and the near-term
    forecasts for the Mobile Devices business, the Company believes
    that the weight of negative historic evidence precludes it from
    considering any forecasted income from the Mobile Devices
    business in its analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax
    assets. However, based on the sustained profits of the Broadband
    Mobility Solutions business, the Company believes that the
    weight of positive historic evidence allows it to include
    forecasted income from that the Broadband Mobility Solutions
    business in its analysis of the recoverability of its deferred
    tax assets. The Company also considered in its analysis tax
    planning strategies that are prudent and can be reasonably
    implemented. Based on all available positive and negative
    evidence, we concluded that a partial valuation allowance should
    be recorded against the net deferred tax assets of our U.S
    operations. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a valuation
    allowance of $2.1 billion. The establishment of the
    valuation allowance was a non-cash expense.

The Company has a total deferred tax asset valuation allowance
    of approximately $2.7 billion against net deferred tax
    assets of approximately $6.2 billion as of
    December 31, 2008, compared to total deferred tax asset
    valuation allowance of $515 million against net deferred
    tax assets of $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2007.

Management believes its assumptions about the future performance
    of the Broadband Mobility Solutions business and the ability of
    the Company to generate sufficient future taxable income to
    realize the remaining deferred tax assets are reasonable. If the
    Broadband Mobility Solutions business does not meet these future
    forecasts or if the Company no longer deems certain tax planning
    strategies prudent or feasible due to changes in circumstances
    not currently contemplated, additional valuation allowances may
    be required in future periods.

Valuation
    of Sigma Fund and Investment Portfolios

The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries invest a
    significant portion of their U.S. dollar-denominated cash
    in a fund (the “Sigma Fund”) that is designed to
    provide investment returns similar to a money market fund.
    Investments in Sigma Fund are carried at fair value. Investments
    not held in Sigma Fund generally consist of equity and debt
    securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and are
    carried at fair value.

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) on
    January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities, and
    non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value as required by other
    accounting pronouncements and expands fair value measurement
    disclosures. The provisions of SFAS 157 are applied
    prospectively upon adoption and did not have a material impact
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Based
    on the framework provided by SFAS 157, the evidence to
    support the fair value is as follows.

Quoted market prices in active markets are available for
    investments in publicly traded common stock and equivalents and,
    as such, these investments are classified within Level 1.

The securities classified as Level 2 are primarily those
    that are professionally managed within the Sigma Fund. The
    valuation models are developed and maintained by third-party
    pricing services and use a number of standard inputs to the
    valuation model, including benchmark yields, reported trades,
    broker/dealer quotes where the party is standing ready and able
    to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers
    and other reference data. The



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

valuation model may prioritize these inputs differently at each
    balance sheet date for any given security, based on the market
    conditions. Not all of the standard inputs listed will be used
    each time in the valuation models. For each asset class,
    quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and
    sector news may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.

In determining the fair value of the Company’s interest
    rate swap derivatives, the Company uses the present value of
    expected cash flows based on market observable interest rate
    yield curves commensurate with the term of each instrument and
    the credit default swap market to reflect the credit risk of
    either the Company or the counterparty. For foreign currency
    derivatives, the Company’s approach is to use forward
    contract and option valuation models employing market observable
    inputs, such as spot currency rates, time value and option
    volatilities. Since the Company primarily uses observable inputs
    in its valuation of its derivative assets and liabilities, they
    are considered Level 2.

Level 3 fixed income securities are debt securities that do
    not have actively traded quotes on the date the Company presents
    its consolidated balance sheets and require the use of
    unobservable inputs, such as indicative quotes from dealers and
    qualitative input from investment advisors, to value these
    securities.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that
    might have an impact on the fair values of its investments in
    Sigma Fund or other investments carried at fair value.

Restructuring
    Activities

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
    “Severance Plan”), which permits the Company to offer
    eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
    and employment grade level in the event that employment is
    involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in-force

or restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in-force

has qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan.
    The Company recognizes termination benefits based on formulas
    per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future
    settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on
    estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved
    by management. Exit costs consist of future minimum lease
    payments on vacated facilities and other contractual
    terminations. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its
    accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure
    the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances,
    accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in
    carrying out the plans or because employees previously
    identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not
    receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not
    foreseen when the original plans were initiated. The Company
    reverses accruals through the income statement line item where
    the original charges were recorded when it is determined they
    are no longer required.

Retirement-Related
    Benefits

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
    “Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
    became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
    is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
    Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
    eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. The Company
    also provides defined benefit plans which cover

non-U.S. employees

in certain jurisdictions, principally the United Kingdom,
    Germany, Ireland, Japan and Korea (the

“Non-U.S. Plans”).

Other pension plans are not material to the Company either
    individually or in the aggregate.

The Company also has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
    benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
    elected officers. The Officers’ Plan contains provisions
    for vesting and funding the participants’ expected
    retirement benefits when the participants meet the minimum age
    and years of service requirements. Elected officers who were not
    yet vested in the Officers’ Plan as of December 31,
    1999 had the option to remain in the Officers’ Plan or
    elect to have their benefit bought out in restricted stock
    units. Effective December 31, 1999, newly elected officers
    are not eligible to participate in the Officers’ Plan.
    Effective June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
    retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
    (“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits to
    individuals by replacing the Regular Pension Plan benefits that
    are lost by such individuals under the retirement formula due to
    application of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue
    Code. However, elected officers who are covered under the
    Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
    buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective
    January 1, 2007, eligible compensation was capped at the
    IRS limit plus $175,000 (the “Cap”) or, for those
    already in excess of the Cap as of January 1, 2007, the
    eligible compensation used to compute such employee’s MSPP
    benefit for all future years will be the greater of:
    (i) such employee’s eligible compensation as of
    January 1,



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2007 (frozen at that amount), or (ii) the relevant Cap for
    the given year. Additionally, effective January 1, 2009,
    the MSPP was frozen as to any new participants after
    January 1, 2009 unless such participation was due to a
    prior contractual entitlement.

In February 2007, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan
    and the MSPP, modifying the definition of average earnings. For
    years ended prior to December 31, 2007, benefits were
    calculated using the rolling average of the highest annual
    earnings in any five years within the previous ten calendar year
    period. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit calculation
    was based on the set of the five highest years of earnings
    within the ten calendar years prior to December 31, 2007,
    averaged with earnings from each year after 2007. Also effective
    January 2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan,
    modifying the vesting period from five years to three years.

In December 2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan,
    the Officers’ Plan and the MSPP (collectively, the
    “2008 Amended Pension Plans”) such that, effective
    March 1, 2009: (i) no participant shall accrue any
    benefit or additional benefit on and after March 1, 2009,
    and (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant
    on and after March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any
    accrued benefit. In 2008, the Company recognized a
    $237 million curtailment gain associated with this plan
    amendment.

Certain healthcare benefits are available to eligible domestic
    employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
    termination of employment (the “Postretirement Health Care
    Benefits Plan”). For eligible employees hired prior to
    January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
    postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
    January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefits
    Plan has been closed to new participants.

Accounting methodologies use an attribution approach that
    generally spreads individual events over the service lives of
    the employees in the plan. Examples of “events” are
    plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as
    discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,
    and rate of compensation increases. The principle underlying the
    required attribution approach is that employees render service
    over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and,
    therefore, the income statement effects of pension benefits or
    postretirement health care benefits are earned in, and should be
    expensed in, the same pattern.

There are various assumptions used in calculating the net
    periodic benefit expense and related benefit obligations. One of
    these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets. The required use of expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income
    that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan
    assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected
    long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual
    long-term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income
    and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of
    the services provided by the employees. Differences between
    actual and expected returns are recognized in the net periodic
    pension calculation over five years.

The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience
    with consideration of the expected investment mix of the
    plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term
    investment returns, to develop its expected rate of return
    assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost and
    the net retirement healthcare expense. The Company’s
    investment return assumption for the Regular Pension Plan and
    Postretirement Healthcare was 8.5% for 2008 and 2007. The
    investment return assumption for the Officers’ Plan was 6%
    in 2008 and 2007. At December 31, 2008, the Regular Pension
    Plan and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan investment
    portfolios were predominantly equity investments and the
    Officers’ Plan investment portfolio was predominantly
    fixed-income securities.

A second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate
    assumptions used for pension benefits and postretirement health
    care benefits accounting reflects, at December 31 of each year,
    the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income debt
    instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the
    measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows
    to pay the benefit obligation when due. The Company’s
    discount rates for measuring its U.S. pension obligations
    were 6.75% at both December 2008 and 2007. The Company’s
    discount rates for measuring the Postretirement Health Care
    Benefits Plan obligation were 6.75% and 6.5% at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

A final set of assumptions involves the cost drivers of the
    underlying benefits. The rate of compensation increase is a key
    assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting
    and is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans
    for such increases. The Company’s 2008 and 2007 rate for
    future compensation increase for the Officers’ Plan was 0%,
    as the salaries to be utilized for calculation of benefits under
    this plan have been frozen. As a result of the 2008 Amended
    Pension Plans, the salaries to be utilized for calculation of
    benefits

    ANALYSIS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

have been frozen, and the Company’s 2008 rate for future
    compensation increase for the Regular Pension Plan was set to
    0%. The Company’s 2007 rate for future compensation
    increase for the Regular Pension Plan was 4%. For Postretirement
    Health Care Benefits Plan accounting, the Company reviews
    external data and its own historical trends for health care
    costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. Based on
    this review, the health care cost trend rate used to determine
    the December 31, 2008 accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation is 8.5% for 2009, with a declining trend rate of
    about 0.7% each year until it reaches 5% by 2014, with a flat 5%
    rate for 2014 and beyond.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized net periodic pension expense of $64 million
    related to its U.S. pension plans and a $237 million
    curtailment gain related to the plan amendments that are
    effective March 1, 2009. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net periodic pension
    expense for its U.S. pension plans were $191 million and
    $258 million, respectively. Cash contributions of
    $243 million were made to the U.S. pension plans in
    2008. The Company expects to make cash contributions of
    approximately $180 million to its U.S. pension plans
    and approximately $50 million to its

non-U.S. pension

plans during 2009.

The 2008 and 2007 Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan
    actual expenses were $15 million in both periods. Cash
    contributions of $16 million were made to this plan in
    2008. The Company expects to make no cash contributions to the
    Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in 2009.

The Company maintains a number of endorsement split-dollar life
    insurance policies that were taken out on now-retired officers
    under a plan that was frozen prior to December 31, 2004.
    The Company had purchased the life insurance policies to insure
    the lives of employees and then entered into a separate
    agreement with the employees that split the policy benefits
    between the Company and the employee. Motorola owns the
    policies, controls all rights of ownership, and may terminate
    the insurance policies. To effect the split-dollar arrangement,
    Motorola endorsed a portion of the death benefits to the
    employee and upon the death of the employee, the employee’s
    beneficiary typically receives the designated portion of the
    death benefits directly from the insurance company and the
    Company receives the remainder of the death benefits.

The Company adopted the provisions of

EITF 06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-4”)

as of January 1, 2008.

EITF 06-4

requires that a liability for the benefit obligation be recorded
    because the promise of postretirement benefit had not been
    settled through the purchase of an endorsement split-dollar life
    insurance arrangement. As a result of the adoption of

EITF 06-4,

the Company recorded a liability representing the actuarial
    present value of the future death benefits as of the
    employees’ expected retirement date of $45 million
    with the offset reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment to
    January 1, 2008 Retained earnings and Non-owner changes to
    equity in the amounts of $4 million and $41 million,
    respectively, in the Company’s consolidated statement of
    stockholders’ equity. It is currently expected that no
    further cash payments are required to fund these policies.

The 2008 Split-Dollar Life Insurance policy actual expense was
    $6 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has
    recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of
    the future death benefits as of the employees’ expected
    retirement date of $47 million with the offset reflected in
    Retained earnings and Non-owner changes to equity in the amounts
    of $4 million and $37 million, respectively, in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’
    equity as of December 31, 2008.

Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high
    degree of volatility and increased the risks and illiquidity
    associated with certain investments held by the pension plans,
    which could impact the value of investments after the date of
    this filing. The Company’s measurement date of its plan
    assets and obligations is December 31.

Valuation
    and Recoverability of Goodwill and Long-lived
    Assets

Goodwill:

The Company tests the recorded
    amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth
    quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is tested more frequently
    if indicators of impairment exist. The Company continually
    assesses whether any indicators of impairment exist, which
    requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may
    include: a sustained significant decline in our share price and
    market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash
    flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the
    business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for
    recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting
    unit; or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change
    in these factors could have a significant impact on the
    recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact
    on our consolidated financial statements.

The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit
    level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level
    below an operating segment (referred to as a
    “component”). A component of an operating



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a
    business for which discrete financial information is available
    and segment management regularly reviews the operating results
    of that component. When two or more components of an operating
    segment have similar economic characteristics, the components
    shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An
    operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all
    of its components are similar, if none of its components is a
    reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single
    component. As such, the Company has determined that the Mobile
    Devices segment meets the requirement of a reporting unit. For
    the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment, the Company has
    identified two reporting units, the Government and Public Safety
    reporting unit and the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit. For
    the Home and Networks Mobility segment, the Company has
    identified two reporting units, the Home reporting unit and the
    Public Networks reporting unit.

The goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. In Step
    One, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its
    book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the
    estimated fair value of these reporting units. Fair value is
    determined using a combination of present value techniques and
    quoted market prices of comparable businesses. If the fair value
    of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is
    not deemed to be impaired for that reporting unit, and no
    further testing would be necessary. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company
    performs Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value of
    the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price
    allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of
    the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the
    reporting unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the
    underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the
    implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. A
    charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying
    value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its
    implied fair value.

The following describes the valuation methodologies used to
    derive the fair value of the reporting units.

•

Income Approach:

To determine fair value, the
    Company discounted the expected cash flows of the reporting
    units. The discount rate used represents the estimated weighted
    average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of
    inherent risk involved in our operations and the rate of return
    a market participant would expect to earn. To estimate cash
    flows beyond the final year of our model, the Company used a
    terminal value approach. Under this approach, the Company used
    estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted it to
    estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth
    assumption and discounted it by a perpetuity discount factor to
    determine the terminal value. The Company incorporated the
    present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate
    of fair value.

•

Market-Based Approach:

To corroborate the
    results of the income approach described above, the Company
    estimated the fair value of our reporting units using several
    market-based approaches, including the value that we derive
    based on our consolidated stock price as described above. The
    Company also used the guideline company method, which focuses on
    comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select
    reasonably similar/guideline publicly traded companies.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we conducted our annual
    assessment of goodwill for impairment. The Company performed
    extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market
    approaches in our goodwill assessment process. During this
    quarter, we experienced a sustained, significant decline in our
    stock price that reduced the market capitalization below the
    book value of the Company. The reduced market capitalization
    reflected the macroeconomic declines coupled with the market
    view on the performance of the Mobile Devices reporting unit.
    The Company has considered this decline in our stock price in
    our impairment assessment.

The Company has weighted the valuation of its reporting units at
    75% based on the income approach and 25% based on the
    market-based approach, consistent with prior periods. The
    Company believes that this weighting is appropriate since it is
    often difficult to find other appropriate publicly traded
    companies that are similar to our reporting units and it is our
    view that future discounted cash flows are more reflective of
    the value of the reporting units. If a heavier weighting was put
    on the market based approach for certain reporting units, a
    higher fair value would have been determined.

The determination of fair value of the reporting units and
    assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires us to
    make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
    assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the
    discount rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before
    depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures
    forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making
    these estimates, actual results could differ from those
    estimates. The Company assigned discount rates ranging from 13
    to 14% for the Home, Public Networks, Government and Public
    Safety and Enterprise Mobility reporting units. The Company
    assigned a



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

discount rate of 25% to the Mobile Devices reporting unit
    commensurate with development stage enterprises or turnaround
    opportunities. The Company believes this rate reflects the
    inherent uncertainties of the Mobile Devices reporting
    unit’s projected cash flows. The Company evaluated the
    merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in
    the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting
    units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets
    and liabilities within the reporting units, and concluded they
    are reasonable.

Based on the results of Step One of our annual assessment of the
    recoverability goodwill, the fair values of the Home, Public
    Networks and Government and Public Safety reporting units
    exceeded their carrying values, indicating that there was no
    impairment of goodwill at these reporting units. The discount
    rate would need to be increased by 5.6% for the Home reporting
    unit, 12.1% for the Public Networks reporting unit and 22.0% for
    the Government and Public Safety reporting unit before the fair
    values of those reporting units would be less than their fair
    values. The Company does not believe the resulting discount
    rates would be reasonable relative to the risks associated with
    the future cash flows of these businesses.

However, the fair values of the Enterprise Mobility and Mobile
    Devices reporting units were below their respective book values,
    indicating a potential impairment of goodwill and the
    requirement to perform Step Two of the analysis for these
    reporting units. The Company acquired the main components of the
    Enterprise Mobility reporting unit in 2007 at which time the
    book value and fair value of the reporting unit was the same.
    Because of this fact, the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit was
    most likely to experience a decline in its fair value below its
    book value as a result of lower values in the overall market and
    the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and the
    market’s view of its near term impact on the reporting
    unit. The decline in the fair value of the Mobile Devices
    reporting unit below its book value is a result of the
    deteriorating macroeconomic environment, lower expected sales
    and cash flows as a result of the decision to consolidate
    platforms announced in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the
    uncertainty around the reporting unit’s future cash flows.

The allocation of the fair value of the reporting units to
    individual assets and liabilities within the reporting units
    also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
    The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value
    of assets and liabilities including, among others, definite
    lived intangible assets, pre-paid assets, deferred taxes and
    current replacement costs for certain property, plant and
    equipment.

Based on the results of the hypothetical purchase price
    allocation in Step Two for the Enterprise Mobility and Mobile
    Devices reporting units, the implied fair value of goodwill was
    $0 for Mobile Devices and $1.0 billion for Enterprise
    Mobility. As a result, the Company reduced the recorded value of
    goodwill by $55 million at the Mobile Devices reporting
    unit (representing all of its goodwill) and $1.6 billion at
    the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit during the three-month
    period ended December 31, 2008.

A further deterioration in the Enterprise Mobility reporting
    unit’s operating results or projected cash flows in the
    future could result in additional impairment charges to
    goodwill. In addition, changes in certain assumptions in the
    current analysis could have a significant impact on the goodwill
    impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the
    Enterprise Mobility reporting unit. For example, a 2% decrease
    in the forecasted EBIT would result in an increase to the
    goodwill impairment charge of approximately $194 million,
    and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would
    result in an increase to the goodwill impairment charge of
    approximately $187 million. The sensitivity amounts above
    are calculated based on the impact of the change in the fair
    value of the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit, as well as the
    impact of changes in the fair values of the assets and
    liabilities of the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit.

The accounting principles regarding goodwill acknowledge that
    the observed market prices of individual trades of a
    company’s stock (and thus its computed market
    capitalization) may not be representative of the fair value of
    the company as a whole. Additional value may arise from the
    ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that
    flow from control over another entity. Consequently, measuring
    the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that
    operate together in a controlled entity is different from
    measuring the fair value of that entity’s individual common
    stock. In most industries, including ours, an acquiring entity
    typically is willing to pay more for equity securities that give
    it a controlling interest than an investor would pay for a
    number of equity securities representing less than a controlling
    interest.

For the purpose of determining the implied control premium
    calculation in the overall goodwill analysis, the Company
    applied assumptions, including for determining the fair value of
    corporate assets. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and
    cash equivalents, Sigma Fund balances, short-term investments,
    investments, deferred tax assets and corporate facilities.
    Judgments about the fair value of corporate assets include,
    among others, an assumption that deferred tax assets should be
    discounted to reflect their economic lives, that a significant
    portion of the corporate assets are required to pay off debt,
    fund the Company’s retirement obligations, meet the near
    term



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

cash requirements of the Mobile Devices reporting unit, and
    market participants’ perceptions of the likely
    restructuring costs, including severance and exit costs, that
    might be incurred if the Company’s strategy is not
    successful. The results of the Company’s impairment
    analysis result in an implied control premium commensurate with
    historical transactions observed in our industry.

After reflecting the impairment charges, goodwill at the Mobile
    Devices and Enterprise Mobility reporting units represented
    $1.0 billion of our $27.9 billion of total assets as
    of December 31, 2008. The Company has no intangible assets
    with indefinite useful lives.

Long-lived Assets:

Long-lived assets include
    property, plant and equipment, intangible asset, long-term
    prepaid assets and other non-current assets. The Company reviews
    long-lived assets held for use for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. Events which may indicate long-lived assets
    may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a
    significant decrease in the market price of long-lived assets, a
    significant adverse change in the manner in which the Company
    utilizes a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the
    business climate, a recent history of operating or cash flow
    losses, or a current expectation that it is more likely than not
    likely that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of in
    the future. For impairment testing purposes, the Company groups
    our long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable
    cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other
    groups of assets and liabilities (the asset group).

If the Company determines that a long-lived asset or asset group
    may not be recoverable, it compares the sum of the expected
    undiscounted future cash flows that the asset or asset group is
    expected to generate to the asset or asset group’s carrying
    value. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceed
    the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, the asset or
    asset group is not considered impaired. However, if the sum of
    the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying
    amount of the assets or asset group, a loss is recognized for
    the difference between the fair value of the asset or asset
    group and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. The
    fair value of the asset or asset group is generally determined
    by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount
    rate that is commensurate with the risk associated with the
    amount and timing of the expected future cash flows.

During 2008, the Company tested two asset groups for impairment.
    The first asset group was tested for impairment when it was
    determined that there was a more likely than not likely
    expectation that assets associated with a technology platform of
    the Enterprise Mobility segment would be disposed of or sold.
    This determination was made because the technology platform was
    no longer considered strategic to the Company. The Company
    determined that the expected future cash flows, which
    incorporated this change in the strategic direction of the
    platform, did not support its carrying amount. As a result, the
    assets, consisting primarily of intangible assets, were written
    down to their fair values. The Company recorded an impairment
    charge of $121 million during 2008 to reduce the carrying
    amount of the asset group to its fair value.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the continued
    operating losses of the Mobile Devices segment, the Company
    tested the long-lived assets of the Mobile Devices segment for
    impairment. The long-lived assets of the Mobile Devices segment
    consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and
    long-term pre-paid licenses. The asset group also included
    elements of working capital including inventory and accounts
    receivable. The Company considered future cash flows expected to
    be generated by the business and weighted them according to
    management’s view of their probability-weighted outcomes.
    The sum of these probability-weighted undiscounted future cash
    flows indicated that the asset group was recoverable. As a
    result, no impairment of long-lived assets was recorded at the
    Mobile Devices segment. A significant assumption in the expected
    future cash flow forecast was that it is more likely than not
    that management will be successful in its plans to turn around
    the Mobile Devices business. The plan to turn around Mobile
    Devices includes a successful execution of the segment’s
    software platform strategy and the Company’s ability to
    execute its cost savings initiatives.

Expectations of future cash flows could change if the Company
    determines it will not be successful in executing its plans to
    turn around the Mobile Devices business. Impairment charges of
    the long-lived assets of Mobile Devices could be required in
    future periods if the Company’s expectations of future cash
    flows changes.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard

    January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities, and
    non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial

statements on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value as
    required by other accounting pronouncements and expands fair
    value measurement disclosures. The provisions of SFAS 157
    are applied prospectively upon adoption and did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. The disclosures required by SFAS 157 are
    included in Note 6, “Fair Value Measurements,” to
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

157-2,

which
    delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial
    assets and liabilities, which are not measured at fair value on
    a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently
    assessing the impact of adopting SFAS 157 for non-financial
    assets and liabilities on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

157-3,

which
    provided guidance to clarify the application of FAS 157 in
    a market that is not active. The Company adopted this FSP in the
    fourth quarter 2008. The net impact of this FSP was
    immaterial.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (“SFAS 159”) as of
    January 1, 2008. SFAS 159 permits entities to elect to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value option for
    any assets or liabilities that were not previously carried at
    fair value. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 159 had no
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted

EITF 06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-4”)

as of January 1, 2008.

EITF 06-4

requires that endorsement split-dollar life insurance
    arrangements, which provide a benefit to an employee beyond the
    postretirement period be recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 106, “Employer’s Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” or APB Opinion
    No. 12, “Omnibus Opinion—1967” (“the
    Statements”) based on the substance of the agreement with
    the employee. Upon adoption of

EITF 06-4,

the Company recognized an increase in Other liabilities of
    $45 million with the offset reflected as a
    cumulative-effect adjustment to January 1, 2008 Retained
    earnings and Non-owner changes to equity in the amounts of
    $4 million and $41 million, respectively, in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’
    equity.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) (“SFAS 141R”), a revision of
    SFAS 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS 141R
    establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of
    acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill and non-controlling
    interests. SFAS 141R also provides disclosure requirements
    related to business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 141R will be applied prospectively to business
    combinations with an acquisition date on or after the effective
    date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes new
    standards for the accounting for and reporting of
    non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and for
    the loss of control of partially owned and consolidated
    subsidiaries. SFAS 160 does not change the criteria for
    consolidating a partially owned entity. SFAS 160 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be applied
    prospectively upon adoption except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively.
    The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133”
    (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 requires enhanced
    disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging
    activities and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
    beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently
    evaluating the additional disclosures required by SFAS 161.

    or our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, could
    cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated
    in the forward-looking statements.



Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall
    exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.
    The Company’s policy prohibits speculation in financial
    instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
    trading in currencies for which there are no underlying
    exposures, or entering into transactions for any currency to
    intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
    are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be
    effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
    being hedged and are designated as part of a hedging
    relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
    changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
    correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
    items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of
    the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy related to foreign exchange exposure
    management is to offset the gains or losses on the financial
    instruments against losses or gains on the underlying
    operational cash flows or investments based on the operating
    business units’ assessment of risk. The Company enters into
    derivative contracts for some of the Company’s
    non-functional currency receivables and payables, which are
    primarily denominated in major currencies that can be traded on
    open markets. The Company uses forward contracts and options to
    hedge these currency exposures. In addition, the Company enters
    into derivative contracts for some firm commitments and some
    forecasted transactions, which are designated as part of a
    hedging relationship if it is determined that the transaction
    qualifies for hedge accounting under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” A portion of the
    Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not traded
    in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent
    reasonably possible, by managing net asset positions, product
    pricing and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had net
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
    $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively.
    Management believes that these financial instruments should not
    subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
    movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
    generally offset losses and gains on the underlying assets,
    liabilities and transactions, except for the ineffective portion
    of the instruments, which are charged to Other within Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations.

The following table shows the five largest net notional amounts
    of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of
    December 31, 2008 and the corresponding positions as of
    December 31, 2007:

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
    counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
    obligations. However, the Company does not expect any
    counterparties, all of whom presently have investment grade
    credit ratings, to fail to meet their obligations.

Foreign exchange financial instruments that are subject to the
    effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect reported
    earnings, include derivative financial instruments and other
    financial instruments which are not denominated in the
    functional currency of the legal entity holding the instrument.
    Derivative financial instruments consist primarily of forward
    contracts and currency options. Other financial instruments,
    which are not denominated in the functional currency of the
    legal entity holding the instrument, consist primarily of cash,
    cash equivalents, Sigma Fund investments and short-term
    investments, as well as accounts payable and receivable.
    Accounts payable and receivable are reflected at fair value in
    the financial statements. The fair value of the foreign exchange
    financial instruments would hypothetically decrease by
    $234 million as of December 31, 2008 if the foreign
    currency rates were to change unfavorably by 10% from current
    levels. This hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on
    future cash flows under the following conditions: (i) all
    current payables and receivables that are hedged were not
    realized, (ii) all hedged commitments and anticipated
    transactions were not realized or canceled, and
    (iii) hedges of these amounts were not canceled or offset.
    The Company does not expect that any of



these conditions will occur. The Company expects that gains and
    losses on the derivative financial instruments should offset
    gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and future
    transactions being hedged. If the hedged transactions were
    included in the sensitivity analysis, the hypothetical change in
    fair value would be immaterial. The foreign exchange financial
    instruments are held for purposes other than trading.

The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of foreign
    currency fair value hedge positions for the periods presented
    were de minimis. These amounts are included in Other within
    Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations. The above amounts include the change
    in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the changes
    in the difference between the spot price and the forward price.
    These amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness.
    Expense (income) related to fair value hedges that were
    discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006 are included in the amounts noted above.

The Company recorded income (expense) of $(2) million,
    $1 million and $13 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
    value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
    in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include
    the change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to
    the changes in the difference between the spot price and the
    forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of
    effectiveness. Expense (income) related to cash flow hedges that
    were discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006 are included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, on
    a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $3 million,
    $(16) million and $(98) million, respectively, was
    reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations.

At December 31, 2008, the maximum term of derivative
    instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was one year. The
    weighted average duration of the Company’s derivative
    instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was seven months.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s short-term debt
    consisted primarily of $89 million of short-term variable
    rate foreign debt. The Company has $4.1 billion of
    long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt,
    which is primarily priced at long-term, fixed interest rates.

As part of its liability management program, the Company
    historically entered into interest rate swaps (“Hedging
    Agreements”) to synthetically modify the characteristics of
    interest rate payments for certain of its outstanding long-term
    debt from fixed-rate payments to short-term variable rate
    payments. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
    terminated all of its Hedging Agreements. The termination of the
    Hedging Agreements resulted in cash proceeds of approximately
    $158 million and a gain of approximately $173 million,
    which has been deferred and will be recognized as a reduction of
    interest expense over the remaining term of the associated debt.

Prior to the termination of the Hedging Agreements in the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the Hedging Agreements were designated as part
    of fair value hedging relationships of the Company’s
    long-term debt. As such, the changes in fair value of the
    Hedging Agreements and corresponding adjustments to the carrying
    amount of the debt were recognized in earnings. Interest expense
    on the debt was adjusted to include payments made or received
    under such Hedging Agreements. During 2008 (prior to the Hedging
    Agreements being terminated) and 2007, the Company recognized
    expense of $1 million and $2 million, respectively,
    representing the ineffective portion of changes in the fair
    value of the Hedging Agreements. These amounts are included in
    Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of operations.

Certain of the terminated Hedging Agreements were originally
    entered into during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company
    entered into the Hedging Agreements concurrently with issuance
    of long-term debt to convert the fixed rate interest cost on the
    newly issued debt to a floating rate. The Hedging Agreements
    were originally designated as fair value hedges of the
    underlying debt, including the Company’s credit spread.
    During the first quarter of 2008, the swaps were no longer
    considered effective hedges because of the volatility in the
    price of the Company’s fixed-rate domestic term debt and
    the swaps were dedesignated. In the same period, the Company was
    able to redesignate the same Hedging Agreements as fair value
    hedges of the underlying debt, exclusive of the Company’s
    credit spread. For the period of time that the Hedging
    Agreements were deemed ineffective hedges, the Company
    recognized a gain of $24 million in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations, representing the increase
    in the fair value of the Hedging Agreements.



Additionally, one of the Company’s European subsidiaries
    has outstanding interest rate agreements (“Interest
    Agreements”) relating to a Euro-denominated loan. The
    interest on the Euro-denominated loan is variable. The Interest
    Agreements change the characteristics of interest rate payments
    from variable to maximum fixed-rate payments. The Interest
    Agreements are not accounted for as a part of a hedging
    relationship and, accordingly, the changes in the fair value of
    the Interest Agreements are included in Other income (expense)
    in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The
    weighted average fixed rate payments on these Interest
    Agreements was 5.07%. The fair value of the Interest Agreements
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $(2) million and
    $3 million, respectively. The fair value of the Interest
    Agreements would hypothetically decrease by $1 million
    (i.e., would decrease from $(2) million to
    $(3) million) if EURIBOR rates were to change unfavorably
    by 10% from current levels.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
    Company minimizes its credit risk concentration on these
    transactions by distributing these contracts among several
    leading financial institutions, all of whom presently have
    investment grade credit ratings, and having collateral
    agreements in place. The Company does not anticipate
    nonperformance.

Net
    Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any
    hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
    foreign operations.

Investments
    Hedge

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into a
    zero-cost collar derivative (the “Sprint Nextel
    Derivative”) to protect itself economically against price
    fluctuations in its 37.6 million shares of Sprint Nextel
    Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) non-voting common stock.
    During the second quarter of 2006, as a result of Sprint
    Nextel’s spin-off of Embarq Corporation through a dividend
    to Sprint Nextel shareholders, the Company received
    approximately 1.9 million shares of Embarq Corporation. The
    floor and ceiling prices of the Sprint Nextel Derivative were
    adjusted accordingly. The Sprint Nextel Derivative was not
    designated as a hedge under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Accordingly, to
    reflect the change in fair value of the Sprint Nextel
    Derivative, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, included in Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations. In December 2006, the Sprint Nextel Derivative
    was terminated and settled in cash and the 37.6 million
    shares of Sprint Nextel were converted to common shares and
    sold. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of
    approximately $820 million from the settlement of the
    Sprint Nextel Derivative and the subsequent sale of the
    37.6 million Sprint Nextel shares. The Company recognized a
    loss of $126 million in connection with the sale of the
    remaining shares of Sprint Nextel common stock. As described
    above, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million in
    connection with the Sprint Nextel Derivative.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
    equivalents, Sigma Fund investments, short-term investments,
    accounts receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable,
    accrued liabilities, derivatives and other financing
    commitments. The Company’s Sigma Fund, available-for-sale
    investment portfolios and derivatives are recorded in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets at fair value. All
    other financial instruments, with the exception of long-term
    debt, are carried at cost, which is not materially different
    than the instruments’ fair values.

Using quoted market prices and market interest rates, the
    Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at
    December 31, 2008 was $2.8 billion, compared to a
    carrying value of $4.1 billion. Since considerable judgment
    is required in interpreting market information, the fair value
    of the long-term debt is not necessarily indicative of the
    amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.



Equity
    Price Market Risk

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s available-for-sale
    equity securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value
    of $128 million, which represented a cost basis of
    $125 million and a net unrealized gains of $3 million.
    The value of the available-for-sale equity securities would
    change by $13 million as of year-end 2008 if the price of
    the stock in each of the publicly-traded companies were to
    change by 10%. These equity securities are held for purposes
    other than trading.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all
    controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and
    balances have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company’s
    material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of
    activities, from the delivery of stand-alone equipment to custom
    design and installation over a period of time to bundled sales
    of equipment, software and services. The Company recognizes
    revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable,
    and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. In
    addition to these general revenue recognition criteria, the
    following specific revenue recognition policies are followed:

Products and Equipment

—For product and equipment
    sales, revenue recognition generally occurs when products or
    equipment have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the
    customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance
    provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and
    allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer
    incentives can be reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are
    reduced by these allowances. The Company bases its estimates on
    historical experience taking into consideration the type of
    products sold, the type of customer, and the type of transaction
    specific in each arrangement. Where customer incentives cannot
    be reliably estimated, the Company recognizes revenue at the
    time the product sells through the distribution channel to the
    end customer.

Long-Term Contracts

—For long-term contracts that
    involve customization of the Company’s equipment or
    software, the Company generally recognizes revenue using the
    percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs
    incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs to
    complete the contract. In certain instances, when revenues or
    costs associated with long-term contracts cannot be reliably
    estimated or the contract involves unproven technologies or
    other inherent hazards, revenues and costs are deferred until
    the project is complete and customer acceptance is obtained.
    When current estimates of total contract revenue and contract
    costs indicate a contract loss, the loss is recognized in the
    period it becomes evident.

Services

—Revenue for services is generally
    recognized ratably over the contract term as services are
    performed.

Software and Licenses

—Revenue from pre-paid
    perpetual licenses is recognized at the inception of the
    arrangement, presuming all other relevant revenue recognition
    criteria are met. Revenue from non-perpetual licenses or term
    licenses is recognized ratably over the period that the licensee
    uses the license. Revenue from software maintenance, technical
    support and unspecified upgrades is generally recognized over
    the period that these services are delivered.

Multiple Element Arrangements

—Arrangements with
    customers may include multiple deliverables, including any
    combination of products, equipment, services and software. For
    multiple element arrangements which include software or
    software-related elements, the Company applies the provisions of
    AICPA Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” to determine separate
    units of accounting and the amount of the arrangement fee to be
    allocated to those separate units of accounting. Multiple
    element arrangements that include software are separated into
    more than one unit of accounting when the following criteria are
    met: (i) the functionality of the delivered element(s) is
    not dependent on the undelivered element(s), (ii) there is
    vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of the
    undelivered element(s), and (iii) general revenue
    recognition criteria related to the delivered element(s) have
    been met. If any of these criteria are not met, revenue is
    deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been
    delivered.

For all other multiple element arrangements, deliverables are
    separated into more than one unit of accounting when the
    following criteria are met: (i) the delivered element(s)
    have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis,
    (ii) objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists
    for the undelivered element(s), and (iii) delivery of the
    undelivered element(s) is probable and substantially in the
    control of the Company. Revenue is allocated to each unit of
    accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting
    unit or using the residual method if objective evidence of fair
    value does not exist for the delivered element(s). If any of
    these criteria are not met, revenue is deferred until the
    criteria are met or the last element has been delivered.



When elements of an arrangement are separated into more than one
    unit of accounting, revenue is recognized for each separate unit
    of accounting based on the nature of the revenue as described
    above.

Sales and Use Taxes

—The Company records taxes
    imposed on revenue-producing transactions, including sales, use,
    value added and excise taxes, on a net basis with such taxes
    excluded from revenue.

Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all
    highly-liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
    three months or less to be cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, restricted cash was
    $343 million and $158 million, respectively.

Sigma Fund:

The Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries invest most of their U.S. dollar-denominated
    cash in a fund (the “Sigma Fund”) that is designed to
    provide investment returns similar to a money market fund. The
    Sigma Fund portfolio is managed by four premier independent
    investment management firms. The investment guidelines of the
    Sigma Fund require that purchased investments must be
    high-quality, investment grade (rated at least

A/A-1

by
    Standard & Poor’s or

A2/P-1

by
    Moody’s Investor Services) U.S. dollar-denominated
    debt obligations, including certificates of deposit, commercial
    paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed and
    mortgaged-backed securities. Except for debt obligations of the
    U.S. treasury and U.S. agencies, no more than 5% of
    the Sigma Fund portfolio is to consist of debt obligations of a
    single issuer. The Sigma Fund investment policies further
    require that floating rate investments must have a maturity at
    purchase date that is not in excess of 36 months with an
    interest rate that is reset at least annually. The average
    interest rate that is reset of investments held in the Sigma
    Fund must be 120 days or less.

Investments in Sigma Fund are carried at fair value. The Company
    primarily relies on valuation pricing models and broker quotes
    to determine the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund.
    The valuation models are developed and maintained by third-party
    pricing services, and use a number of standard inputs, including
    benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes where
    the counterparty is standing ready and able to transact, issuer
    spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.
    For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to perceived
    market movements and sector news may also be considered in
    addition to the standard inputs.

The Company considers a decline in the fair value of a security
    in Sigma Fund to be temporary if it believes that it will
    collect all amounts it is owed on the security according to its
    contractual terms, which may be at maturity. If it becomes
    probable that the Company will not collect all amounts that it
    is owed according to a security’s contractual terms, it
    considers the security to be impaired and adjusts its cost basis
    of the security by the related impairment loss. Beginning in the
    fourth quarter of 2008, all changes in the fair value of Sigma
    Fund investments, including temporary unrealized gains (losses)
    and impairment charges, are recorded in Other within Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations.

Investments:

Investments in equity and debt
    securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair
    value. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are
    carried at amortized cost. Equity securities that are restricted
    for more than one year or that are not publicly traded are
    carried at cost. Certain investments are accounted for using the
    equity method if the company has significant influence over the
    issuing entity.

The Company assesses declines in the fair value of investments
    to determine whether such declines are other-than-temporary.
    This assessment is made considering all available evidence,
    including changes in general market conditions, specific
    industry and individual company data, the length of time and the
    extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the
    financial condition and the near-term prospects of the entity
    issuing the security, and the Company’s ability and intent
    to hold investment until recovery. Other-than-temporary
    impairments of investments are recorded to Other within Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations in the period in which they become impaired.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the
    lower of average cost (which approximates computation on a

first-in,

first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement
    cost).

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is recorded using straight-line and
    declining-balance methods, based on the estimated useful lives
    of the assets (buildings and building equipment,
    5-40 years; machinery and equipment, 2-10 years) and
    commences once the assets are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill is
    not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least
    annually. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the
    reporting unit level and is a two-step analysis. First, the fair
    value (“FV”) of each reporting unit is compared to its
    book value. If the FV of the reporting unit is less than



its book value, the Company performs a hypothetical purchase
    price allocation based on the reporting unit’s FV to
    determine the FV of the reporting unit’s goodwill. FV is
    determined using a combination of present value techniques and
    market prices of comparable businesses.

Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line
    basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from
    one to 14 years. The Company has no intangible assets with
    indefinite useful lives.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

Long-lived
    assets, which include intangible assets, held and used by the
    Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may
    not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of
    assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of
    an asset (group) to future net undiscounted cash flows to be
    generated by the asset (group). If an asset is considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount
    by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    asset’s fair value calculated using a discounted future
    cash flows analysis or market comparables. Assets held for sale,
    if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
    value less cost to sell.

Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
    attributable to differences between the financial statement
    carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry
    forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
    enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the
    period that includes the enactment date.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if,
    based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more
    likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will
    not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that
    can be objectively verified. The Company evaluates deferred
    income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation
    allowances are required by considering available evidence.
    Deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future
    taxable income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes
    otherwise payable. The sources of taxable income that may be
    available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are
    future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,
    future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carry-forwards, taxable income in carry-back
    years and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and
    feasible.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
    (“FIN 48”). Beginning January 1, 2007, the
    Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if
    sustaining those positions is more likely than not in accordance
    with the provisions of FIN 48. Changes in recognition or
    measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in
    judgment occurs. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Company
    recognized the effect of income tax positions only if such
    positions were probable of being sustained. The Company records
    interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest
    expense and penalties in Selling, general and administrative
    expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations.

Long-term Receivables:

Long-term receivables
    include trade receivables where contractual terms of the note
    agreement are greater than one year. Long-term receivables are
    considered impaired when management determines collection of all
    amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note
    agreement, including principal and interest, is no longer
    probable. Impaired long-term receivables are valued based on the
    present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the
    receivable’s effective rate of interest, or the fair value
    of the collateral if the receivable is collateral dependent.
    Interest income and late fees on impaired long-term receivables
    are recognized only when payments are received. Previously
    impaired long-term receivables are no longer considered impaired
    and are reclassified to performing when they have performed
    under a workout or restructuring for four consecutive quarters.

Foreign Currency:

Certain of the
    Company’s

non-U.S. operations

use their respective local currency as their functional
    currency. Those operations that do not have the U.S. dollar
    as their functional currency translate assets and liabilities at
    current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date
    and revenues and expenses using rates that approximate those in
    effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments
    are included as a component of Non-owner changes to equity in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. For those
    operations that have the U.S. dollar as their functional
    currency, transactions denominated in the local currency are
    measured in U.S. dollars using the current rates of
    exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical
    rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from
    remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are included in
    Other within Other income (expense) within the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations.



Derivative Instruments:

Gains and losses on
    hedges of existing assets or liabilities are marked-to-market
    and the result is included in Other within Other income
    (expense) within the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations. Gains and losses on financial instruments that
    qualify for hedge accounting and are used to hedge firm future
    commitments or forecasted transactions are deferred until such
    time as the underlying transactions are recognized or recorded
    immediately when the transaction is no longer expected to occur.
    Gains or losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as
    hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“SFAS 133”) are recognized immediately as income
    or expense.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share:

The Company
    calculates its basic earnings (loss) per share based on the
    weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and
    outstanding. Net earnings (loss) is divided by the weighted
    average common shares outstanding during the period to arrive at
    the basic earnings (loss) per share. Diluted earnings (loss) per
    share is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) by the sum
    of the weighted average number of common shares used in the
    basic earnings (loss) per share calculation and the weighted
    average number of common shares that would be issued assuming
    exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities,
    excluding those securities that would be anti-dilutive to the
    earnings (loss) per share calculation. Both basic and diluted
    earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated for earnings
    (loss) from continuing operations and net earnings (loss) for
    all periods presented.

Share-Based Compensation Costs:

The Company
    has incentive plans that reward employees with stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock
    units, as well as an employee stock purchase plan. Prior to
    January 1, 2006, the Company applied the intrinsic value
    method of accounting for share-based compensation. On
    January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”) using the modified prospective
    transition method. The Company had previously disclosed the fair
    value of its stock options in its footnotes. The amount of
    compensation cost for share-based awards is measured based on
    the fair value of the awards, as of the date that the
    share-based awards are issued and adjusted to the estimated
    number of awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of
    stock options and stock appreciation rights is generally
    determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which
    incorporates assumptions about expected volatility, risk free
    rate, dividend yield, and expected life. Compensation cost for
    share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the vesting period.

Retirement Benefits:

The Company records
    annual expenses relating to its pension benefit and
    postretirement plans based on calculations which include various
    actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed asset
    rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and
    health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial
    assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the
    assumptions based on current rates and trends. The effects of
    the gains, losses, and prior service costs and credits are
    amortized over future service periods. The funding status, or
    projected benefit obligation less plan assets, for each plan, is
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets
    using a December 31 measurement date.

Advertising Expense:

Advertising expenses,
    which are the external costs of marketing the Company’s
    products, are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were
    $790 million, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions about
    future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions
    affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported,
    disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates
    include the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term
    receivables, inventories, Sigma Fund, investments, goodwill,
    intangible and other long-lived assets, legal contingencies,
    guarantee obligations, indemnifications, and assumptions used in
    the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other
    post-employment benefits and allowances for discounts, price
    protection, product returns, and customer incentives, among
    others. These estimates and assumptions are based on
    management’s best estimates and judgment. Management
    evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis
    using historical experience and other factors, including the
    current economic environment, which management believes to be
    reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and
    assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid
    credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency, energy
    markets and declines in consumer spending have combined to
    increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and
    assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be
    determined with precision, actual results could differ
    significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates
    resulting for continuing changes in the economic environment
    will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.



Reclassifications:

Certain amounts in prior
    years’ financial statements and related notes have been
    reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

The Company
    adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS 157”) on January 1, 2008 for
    financial assets and liabilities, and non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value as required by other accounting pronouncements and expands
    fair value measurement disclosures. The provisions of
    SFAS 157 were applied prospectively upon adoption and did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. The disclosures required by SFAS 157
    are included in Note 9, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” to the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

157-2,

which
    delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial
    assets and liabilities, which are not measured at fair value on
    a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently
    assessing the impact of adopting SFAS 157 for non-financial
    assets and liabilities on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

(“FSP”) 157-3,

which provided guidance to clarify the application of
    FAS 157 in a market that is not active. The Company adopted
    this FSP in the fourth quarter of 2008. The net impact of
    this FSP was immaterial.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (“SFAS 159”) as of
    January 1, 2008. SFAS 159 permits entities to elect to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value option for
    any assets or liabilities, which were not previously carried at
    fair value. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 159 had no
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted

EITF 06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-4”)

as of January 1, 2008.

EITF 06-4

requires that endorsement split-dollar life insurance
    arrangements, which provide a benefit to an employee beyond the
    postretirement period be recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 106, “Employer’s Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” or APB Opinion
    No. 12, “Omnibus Opinion—1967” (“the
    Statements”) based on the substance of the agreement with
    the employee. Upon adoption of

EITF 06-4,

the Company recognized an increase in Other liabilities of
    $45 million with the offset reflected as a
    cumulative-effect adjustment to January 1, 2008 Retained
    earnings and Non-owner changes to equity in the amounts of
    $4 million and $41 million, respectively, in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’
    equity.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) (“SFAS 141R”), a revision of
    SFAS 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS 141R
    establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of
    acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill and non-controlling
    interests. SFAS 141R also provides disclosure requirements
    related to business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 141R will be applied prospectively to business
    combinations with an acquisition date on or after the effective
    date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes new
    standards for the accounting for and reporting of
    non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and for
    the loss of control of partially owned and consolidated
    subsidiaries. SFAS 160 does not change the criteria for
    consolidating a partially owned entity. SFAS 160 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be applied
    prospectively upon adoption except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively.
    The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133”
    (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 requires enhanced
    disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging
    activities and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
    beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently
    evaluating the additional disclosures required by SFAS 161.



2. Discontinued
    Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    completed the sale of its automotive electronics business to
    Continental AG for $856 million in net cash received. The
    Company recorded a gain on sale of business of $399 million
    before income taxes, which is included in Earnings (loss) from
    discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations.

On December 2, 2004, the Company completed the separation
    and spin-off of Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale
    Semiconductor”). Under the terms of the Master Separation
    and Distribution Agreement entered into between Motorola and
    Freescale Semiconductor, Freescale Semiconductor has agreed to
    indemnify Motorola for substantially all past, present and
    future liabilities associated with the semiconductor business.
    The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend
    to Motorola stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by
    $2.5 billion. The equity distribution was structured to be
    tax-free to Motorola stockholders for U.S. tax purposes
    (other than with respect to any cash received in lieu of
    fractional shares).

The financial results of the automotive electronics business and
    Freescale Semiconductor were reflected as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated financial statements and related
    notes thereto. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    discontinued operations activity primarily relates to the
    resolution and payment of certain indemnifications relating to a
    divestiture. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    discontinued operations activity primarily relates to
    resolutions of certain matters with the tax authorities and
    payments of post-retiree medical claims to former employees.

The following table displays summarized activity in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations for
    discontinued operations during the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006. The Company had no such activity during the year
    end December 31, 2008.

For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    was in a loss position and accordingly, the basic and diluted
    weighted average shares outstanding are equal because any
    increase to the basic shares would be antidilutive. Once the
    Company returns to profitability, the diluted impact of stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units
    will be evaluated for their impact on the weighted average
    shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings
    (loss) per common share.

For the year ended December 31, 2006 in the computation of
    diluted earnings (loss) per common share from both continuing
    operations and on a net earnings (loss) basis, 76.6 million
    stock options were excluded because their inclusion would have
    been antidilutive.

The fair market value of investments in the Sigma Fund was
    $4.2 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company considers unrealized losses in the Sigma Fund to be
    temporary, as these losses have resulted primarily from the
    ongoing disruptions in the capital markets. On the securities
    for which the unrealized losses are considered temporary
    (excluding impaired securities), the Company believes it is
    probable that it will be able to collect all amounts it is owed
    according to their contractual terms, which may be at maturity.
    Temporary unrealized losses in the Sigma Fund were
    $101 million and $57 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

If it becomes probable the Company will not collect amounts it
    is owed on securities according to their contractual terms, the
    Company considers the security to be impaired and adjusts the
    cost basis of the security accordingly. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, impairment charges in the Sigma
    Fund were $186 million and $18 million, respectively.
    The impairment charges were primarily related to investments in
    Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., Washington Mutual, Inc., and
    Sigma Finance Corporation, an unrelated special investment
    vehicle managed by United Kingdom-based Gordian Knot, Limited.

Securities with a significant temporary unrealized loss and a
    maturity greater than 12 months and impaired securities
    have been classified as non-current in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2008,
    $466 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified
    as non-current, and the weighted average maturity of the Sigma
    Fund investments classified as non-current (excluding impaired
    securities) was 16 months. At December 31, 2007, none
    of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as non-current.

Prior to the three months ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company recognized impairment charges from Sigma Fund
    investments in its consolidated statements of operations and
    temporary unrealized losses in Sigma Fund investments as a
    component of

Non-owner

changes to equity in the consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ equity. During the three months ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company determined that temporary
    unrealized losses in Sigma Fund investments should also be
    recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of



operations, even though the related securities were not
    considered impaired. Because the Sigma Fund uses
    investment-company accounting in its

stand-alone

financial statements, it marks the investments in the fund to
    market and records all unrealized gains or losses in earnings,
    whether or not the related securities are considered impaired.
    The Company has determined that the stand-alone accounting
    policies of the Sigma Fund should be retained in its
    consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company
    recorded $101 million of accumulated temporary unrealized
    losses in Sigma Fund investments in its consolidated statements
    of operations during the three months ended December 31,
    2008, which represents all of the temporary unrealized gains and
    losses that have accumulated in Sigma Fund investments as of
    December 31, 2008. Portions of the temporary unrealized
    losses recognized in the three months ended December 31,
    2008 arose in periods prior to the three months ended
    December 31, 2008 and should have been reflected in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations in the
    periods in which they arose. The Company has determined that the
    impact of the amounts that arose in prior periods is not
    material to the consolidated results of operations of those
    prior periods.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recorded total charges related to Sigma Fund investments,
    including temporary unrealized losses and impairment charges, of
    $287 million in its consolidated statement of operations.
    During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded total charges of $18 million, all of which were
    impairment charges, in its consolidated statements of
    operations. There were no temporary unrealized losses or
    impairment charges in the Sigma Fund investment portfolio during
    the year ended December 31, 2006.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $225 million in
    short-term investments (which are highly-liquid fixed-income
    investments with an original maturity greater than three months
    but less than one year), compared to $612 million of
    short-term investments at December 31, 2007.



At December 31, 2008, the Company’s available-for-sale
    equity securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value
    of $128 million, which represented a cost basis of
    $125 million and a net unrealized gain of $3 million.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company’s available-for-sale
    securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value of
    $333 million, which represented a cost basis of
    $372 million and a net unrealized loss of $39 million.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    the Company recorded investment impairment charges of
    $365 million, $44 million and $27 million,
    respectively, representing other-than-temporary declines in the
    value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment
    portfolio. Investment impairment charges are included in Other
    within Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations.

    $34 million gain on the sale of the Company’s embedded
    communication computing business. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the $41 million of net gains was
    primarily related to a $141 million gain on the sale of the

At December 31, 2008, the Company did not have any
    commercial paper outstanding.

In December 2008, the Company completed the open market purchase
    of $42 million of the $400 million aggregate principal
    amount outstanding of its 7.50% Debentures due 2025 (the
    “2025 Debentures”). The $42 million principal
    amount of 2025 Debentures was purchased for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $28 million, including
    accrued interest as of the redemption date. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized a gain of
    approximately $14 million related to this open market
    purchase in Other within Other income (expense) in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

In October 2008, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire
    $84 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
    5.80% Notes due October 15, 2008. In March 2008, the
    Company repaid at maturity, the entire $114 million
    aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 6.50% Notes
    due March 1, 2008.

In November 2007, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire
    $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
    4.608% Notes due November 16, 2007. In November 2007,
    the Company issued an aggregate face principal amount of:
    (i) $400 million of 5.375% Senior Notes due
    November 15, 2012, (ii) $400 million of
    6.00% Senior Notes due November 15, 2017, and
    (iii) $600 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due
    November 15, 2037. In January 2007, the Company repaid, at
    maturity, the entire $118 million aggregate principal
    amount outstanding of its 7.6% Notes due January 1,
    2007.

Aggregate requirements for long-term debt maturities during the
    next five years are as follows: 2009—$3 million;
    2010—$536 million; 2011—$609 million;
    2012—$410 million; and 2013—$11 million.

In December 2006, the Company entered into a five-year domestic
    syndicated revolving credit facility

(“5-Year

Credit Facility”) for $2.0 billion. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no outstanding
    borrowings under the 5-Year Credit Facility. At
    December 31, 2008, the commitment fee assessed against the
    daily average amounts unused was 10.0 basis points.
    Important terms of the

5-Year

Credit Facility include a covenant relating to the ratio of
    total debt to adjusted EBITDA. The Company was in compliance
    with the terms of the

5-Year

Credit Facility at December 31, 2008.

Events over the past several months, including recent failures
    and near failures of a number of large financial service
    companies, have made the capital markets increasingly volatile.
    The Company also has access to uncommitted

non-U.S. credit

facilities (“uncommitted facilities”), but in light of
    the state of the financial services industry and the
    Company’s current financial condition, the Company does not
    believe it is prudent to assume the same level of funding will
    be available under those facilities going forward as has been
    available historically.

The Company’s current corporate credit ratings are
    “BBB−” with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings
    (“Fitch”), “Baa3” with a negative outlook by
    Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), and
    “BB+” with a stable outlook by Standard &
    Poor’s (“S&P”).



5. Risk
    Management

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall
    exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.
    The Company’s policy prohibits speculation in financial
    instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
    trading in currencies for which there are no underlying
    exposures, or entering into transactions for any currency to
    intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
    are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be
    effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
    being hedged and are designated as part of a hedging
    relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
    changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
    correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
    items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of
    the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy related to foreign exchange exposure
    management is to offset the gains or losses on the financial
    instruments against losses or gains on the underlying
    operational cash flows or investments based on the operating
    business units’ assessment of risk. The Company enters into
    derivative contracts for some of the Company’s
    non-functional currency receivables and payables, which are
    primarily denominated in major currencies that can be traded on
    open markets. The Company uses forward contracts and options to
    hedge these currency exposures. In addition, the Company enters
    into derivative contracts for some firm commitments and some
    forecasted transactions, which are designated as part of a
    hedging relationship if it is determined that the transaction
    qualifies for hedge accounting under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” A portion of the
    Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not traded
    in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent
    reasonably possible, by managing net asset positions, product
    pricing and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had net
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
    $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively.
    Management believes that these financial instruments should not
    subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
    movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
    generally offset losses and gains on the underlying assets,
    liabilities and transactions, except for the ineffective portion
    of the instruments, which are charged to Other within Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations.

The following table shows the five largest net notional amounts
    of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of
    December 31, 2008 and the corresponding positions as of
    December 31, 2007:

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
    counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
    obligations. However, the Company does not expect any
    counterparties, all of whom presently have investment grade
    credit ratings, to fail to meet their obligations.

The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of foreign
    currency fair value hedge positions for the periods presented
    were de minimis. These amounts are included in Other within
    Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations. The above amounts include the change
    in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the changes
    in the difference between the spot price and the forward price.
    These amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness.
    Expense (income) related to fair value hedges that were
    discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006 are included in the amounts noted above.

The Company recorded income (expense) of $(2) million,
    $1 million and $13 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
    value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
    in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include
    the change in the fair value of



derivative contracts related to the changes in the difference
    between the spot price and the forward price. These amounts are
    excluded from the measure of effectiveness. Expense (income)
    related to cash flow hedges that were discontinued for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are included in the
    amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, on
    a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $3 million,
    $(16) million and $(98) million, respectively, was
    reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations.

At December 31, 2008, the maximum term of derivative
    instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was one year. The
    weighted average duration of the Company’s derivative
    instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was seven months.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s short-term debt
    consisted primarily of $89 million of short-term variable
    rate foreign debt. The Company has $4.1 billion of
    long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt,
    which is primarily priced at long-term, fixed interest rates.

As part of its liability management program, the Company
    historically entered into interest rate swaps (“Hedging
    Agreements”) to synthetically modify the characteristics of
    interest rate payments for certain of its outstanding long-term
    debt from fixed-rate payments to short-term variable rate
    payments. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
    terminated all of its Hedging Agreements. The termination of the
    Hedging Agreements resulted in cash proceeds of approximately
    $158 million and a gain of approximately $173 million,
    which has been deferred and will be recognized as a reduction of
    interest expense over the remaining term of the associated debt.

Prior to the termination of the Hedging Agreements in the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the Hedging Agreements were designated as part
    of fair value hedging relationships of the Company’s
    long-term debt. As such, the changes in fair value of the
    Hedging Agreements and corresponding adjustments to the carrying
    amount of the debt were recognized in earnings. Interest expense
    on the debt was adjusted to include payments made or received
    under such Hedge Agreements. During 2008 (prior to the Hedging
    Agreements being terminated) and 2007, the Company recognized
    expense of $1 million and $2 million, respectively,
    representing the ineffective portion of changes in the fair
    value of the Hedging Agreements. These amounts are included in
    Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of operations.

Certain of the terminated Hedging Agreements were originally
    entered into during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company
    entered into the Hedging Agreements concurrently with issuance
    of long-term debt to convert the fixed rate interest cost on the
    newly issued debt to a floating rate. The Hedging Agreements
    were originally designated as fair value hedges of the
    underlying debt, including the Company’s credit spread.
    During the first quarter of 2008, the swaps were no longer
    considered effective hedges because of the volatility in the
    price of the Company’s fixed-rate domestic term debt and
    the swaps were dedesignated. In the same period, the Company was
    able to redesignate the same Hedging Agreements as fair value
    hedges of the underlying debt, exclusive of the Company’s
    credit spread. For the period of time that the Hedging
    Agreements were deemed ineffective hedges, the Company
    recognized a gain of $24 million in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations, representing the increase
    in the fair value of the Hedging Agreements.

Additionally, one of the Company’s European subsidiaries
    has outstanding interest rate agreements (“Interest
    Agreements”) relating to a Euro-denominated loan. The
    interest on the Euro-denominated loan is variable. The Interest
    Agreements change the characteristics of interest rate payments
    from variable to maximum fixed-rate payments. The Interest
    Agreements are not accounted for as a part of a hedging
    relationship and, accordingly, the changes in the fair value of
    the Interest Agreements are included in Other income (expense)
    in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The
    weighted average fixed rate payments on these Interest
    Agreements was 5.07%. The fair value of the Interest Agreements
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $(2) million and
    $3 million, respectively.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
    Company minimizes its credit risk concentration on these
    transactions by distributing these contracts among several
    leading financial institutions, all of whom presently have
    investment grade credit ratings, and having collateral
    agreements in place. The Company does not anticipate
    nonperformance.

Net
    Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any
    hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
    foreign operations.

Investments
    Hedge

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into a
    zero-cost collar derivative (the “Sprint Nextel
    Derivative”) to protect itself economically against price
    fluctuations in its 37.6 million shares of Sprint Nextel
    Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) non-voting common stock.
    During the second quarter of 2006, as a result of Sprint
    Nextel’s spin-off of Embarq Corporation through a dividend
    to Sprint Nextel shareholders, the Company received
    approximately 1.9 million shares of Embarq Corporation. The
    floor and ceiling prices of the Sprint Nextel Derivative were
    adjusted accordingly. The Sprint Nextel Derivative was not
    designated as a hedge under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Accordingly, to
    reflect the change in fair value of the Sprint Nextel
    Derivative, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, included in Other
    income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations. In December 2006, the Sprint Nextel Derivative
    was terminated and settled in cash and the 37.6 million
    shares of Sprint Nextel were converted to common shares and
    sold. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of
    approximately $820 million from the settlement of the
    Sprint Nextel Derivative and the subsequent sale of the
    37.6 million Sprint Nextel shares. The Company recognized a
    loss of $126 million in connection with the sale of the
    remaining shares of Sprint Nextel common stock. As described
    above, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million in
    connection with the Sprint Nextel Derivative.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
    equivalents, Sigma Fund investments, short-term investments,
    accounts receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable,
    accrued liabilities, derivatives and other financing
    commitments. The Company’s Sigma Fund, available-for-sale
    investment portfolios and derivatives are recorded in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets at fair value. All
    other financial instruments, with the exception of long-term
    debt, are carried at cost, which is not materially different
    than the instruments’ fair values.

Using quoted market prices and market interest rates, the
    Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at
    December 31, 2008 was $2.8 billion, compared to a
    carrying value of $4.1 billion. Since considerable judgment
    is required in interpreting market information, the fair value
    of the long-term debt is not necessarily indicative of the
    amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.

Equity
    Price Market Risk

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s available-for-sale
    equity securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value
    of $128 million, which represented a cost basis of
    $125 million and a net unrealized loss of $3 million.
    These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

Deferred tax charges (benefits) that were recorded within
    Non-owner changes to equity in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets resulted from retirement benefit adjustments,
    currency translation adjustments, net gains (losses) on
    derivative instruments and fair value adjustments to
    available-for-sale securities. The adjustments were
    ($738) million, $306 million and $(182) million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Except for certain earnings that the Company
    intends to reinvest indefinitely, provisions have been made for
    the estimated U.S. federal income taxes applicable to
    undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Undistributed earnings that the Company intends to reinvest
    indefinitely, and for which no U.S. federal income taxes
    have been provided, aggregate to $2.9 billion,
    $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The portion of earnings not
    reinvested indefinitely may be distributed without an additional
    U.S. federal income tax charge given the U.S. federal
    tax accrued on undistributed earnings and the utilization of
    available foreign tax credits.

Differences between income tax expense (benefit) computed at the

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires that
    deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted
    tax rates for the effect of the temporary differences between
    the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The
    Company makes estimates and judgments with regard to the
    calculation of certain income tax assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets be
    reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration
    of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
    portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
    Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively
    verified.

The Company evaluates deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis
    to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering
    available evidence, including historical and projected taxable
    income and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and
    feasible. As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s U.S
    operations had generated two consecutive years of pre-tax
    losses, which are attributable to the Mobile Devices segment.
    During 2007 and 2008, the Home and Networks Mobility and
    Enterprise Mobility Solution businesses (collectively referred
    to as the “Broadband Mobility Solutions business”)
    were profitable in the U.S. and worldwide. Because of the
    2007 and 2008 losses at Mobile Devices and the near-term
    forecasts for the Mobile Devices business, the Company believes
    that the weight of negative historic evidence precludes it from
    considering any forecasted income from the Mobile Devices
    business in its analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax
    assets. However, based on the sustained profits of the Broadband
    Mobility Solutions business, the Company believes that the
    weight of positive historic evidence allows it to include
    forecasted income from the Broadband Mobility business in its
    analysis of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. The
    Company also considered in its analysis tax planning strategies
    that are prudent and can be reasonably implemented. Based on all
    available positive and negative evidence, we concluded that a
    partial valuation allowance should be recorded against the net
    deferred tax assets of our U.S operations. During fiscal 2008,
    we recorded a valuation allowance of $2.1 billion for
    foreign tax credits, general business credits, capital losses
    and state tax carry forwards that are more likely than not to
    expire. The Company also recorded valuation allowances of
    $126 million relating to tax carryforwards and deferred tax
    assets of

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

including Brazil, China and Spain, that the Company believes are
    more likely than not to expire or go unused.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had valuation
    allowances of $2.7 billion and $515 million,
    respectively, against its deferred tax assets, including
    $297 million and $310 million, respectively, relating
    to deferred tax assets for

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The Company’s valuation allowances for its

non-U.S. subsidiaries

had a net decrease of $13 million during 2008, which is
    comprised of $139 million decrease primarily related to the
    utilization of United Kingdom tax carry forwards and changes in
    the valuation allowance balance due to exchange rate variances,
    partially offset by a $126 million increase for new
    valuation allowances. The U.S. valuation allowance relates
    primarily to tax carryforwards, including foreign tax credits,
    general business credits, tax carryforwards of acquired
    businesses which have limitations upon their use, state tax
    carryforwards and future



capital losses related to certain investments. The Company
    believes that the remaining deferred tax assets are more likely
    than not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable
    income and the implementation of tax planning strategies.

The Company adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The
    adoption resulted in a $120 million reduction of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits and related interest
    accrual and has been reflected as an increase in the opening
    balance of Retained earnings of $27 million and Additional
    paid-in capital of $93 million as of January 1, 2007.
    Upon the adoption of FIN 48, the Company also reclassified
    unrecognized tax benefits of $877 million from Deferred
    income tax to Other liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets.

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, including those
    attributable to discontinued operations, is as follows:

Included in the balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, are potential benefits of
    approximately $790 million and $590 million,
    respectively, net of federal tax benefits that if recognized
    would affect the effective tax rate.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company entered into
    closing agreements with the appellate level of the Internal
    Revenue Service (“IRS”) on transfer pricing
    adjustments for tax years 1996 through 2003 and the IRS
    completed its review of the research credit, thereby resolving
    all significant IRS audit issues for years

1996-2003.

The IRS also completed its field examination of the
    Company’s 2004 and 2005 tax returns in July 2008, and there
    are no significant unagreed issues. As a result of the foregoing
    and resolution of

Non-U.S.

audits, the Company reduced its unrecognized income tax
    benefits. The Company expects to receive a net tax refund of
    $126 million, primarily relating to refund claims that were
    held pending the resolution of the

1996-2003

tax years.



During the fourth quarter of 2008, the IRS started the field
    examination of the Company’s 2006 and 2007 tax years. The
    Company also has several state and

Non-U.S.

audits pending. A summary of open tax years by major
    jurisdiction is presented below:

Includes federal as well as state, provincial or similar local

Although the final resolution of the Company’s global tax
    disputes is uncertain, based on current information, in the
    opinion of the Company’s management, the ultimate
    disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or results of operations. However, an unfavorable
    resolution of the Company’s global tax disputes could have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the
    periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved.

Based on the potential outcome of the Company’s global tax
    examinations, the expiration of the statute of limitations for
    specific jurisdictions, or the continued ability to satisfy tax
    incentive obligations, it is reasonably possible that the
    unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next
    12 months. The associated net tax benefits, which would
    favorably impact the effective tax rate, are estimated to be in
    the range of $0 to $150 million, with cash payments not
    expected to exceed $50 million.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $47 million and
    $11 million accrued for interest and penalties,
    respectively, on unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31,
    2007, the Company had $86 million and $10 million
    accrued for interest and penalties, respectively, on
    unrecognized tax benefits.

Retirement
    Benefits

Pension
    Benefit Plans

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
    “Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
    became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
    is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
    Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
    eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. The Company
    also provides defined benefit plans which cover

non-U.S. employees

in certain jurisdictions principally the United Kingdom,
    Germany, Ireland, Japan and Korea (the

“Non-U.S. Plans”).

Other pension plans are not material to the Company either
    individually or in the aggregate.

The Company has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
    benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
    officers elected prior to December 31, 1999. The
    Officers’ Plan contains provisions for vesting and funding
    the participants’ expected retirement benefits when the
    participants meet the minimum age and years of service
    requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the
    Officers’ Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option
    to remain in the Officers’ Plan or elect to have their
    benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective
    December 31, 1999, newly elected officers are not eligible
    to participate in the Officers’ Plan. Effective
    June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
    retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
    (“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits to
    individuals by replacing the Regular Pension Plan benefits that
    are lost by such individuals under the retirement formula due to
    application of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue
    Code. However, elected officers who are covered under the
    Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
    buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective



January 1, 2007, eligible compensation was capped at the
    IRS limit plus $175,000 or, for those already in excess of the
    Cap as of January 1, 2007, the eligible compensation used
    to compute such employee’s MSPP benefit for all future
    years will be the greater of: (i) such employee’s
    eligible compensation as of January 1, 2007 (frozen at that
    amount), or (ii) the relevant Cap for the given year.
    Additionally, effective January 1, 2009, the MSPP was
    frozen as to any new participants after January 1, 2009
    unless such participation was due to a prior contractual
    entitlement.

In February 2007, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan
    and the MSPP, modifying the definition of average earnings. For
    the years ended prior to December 31, 2007, benefits were
    calculated using the rolling average of the highest annual
    earnings in any five years within the previous ten calendar year
    period. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit calculation was
    based on the set of the five highest years of earnings within
    the ten calendar years prior to December 31, 2007, averaged
    with earnings from each year after 2007. Also, effective January
    2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, modifying
    the vesting period from five years to three years.

In December 2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan,
    the Officers’ Plan and the MSPP. Effective March 1,
    2009, (i) no participant shall accrue any benefit or
    additional benefit on and after March 1, 2009, and
    (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant on
    and after March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any
    accrued benefit. Additionally, no service performed on and after
    March 1, 2009, shall be considered service for any purpose
    under the MSPP. The Company recognized a $237 million
    curtailment gain associated with this plan amendment.

It is estimated that the net periodic cost for 2009 will include
    amortization of the unrecognized net loss and prior service
    costs for the Regular Plan, Officers’ and MSPP Plans, and

Non-U.S. Plans,

currently included in Non-owner changes to equity, of
    $83 million, $3 million, and $7 million,
    respectively.

The Company uses a five-year, market-related asset value method
    of amortizing asset-related gains and losses. Prior service
    costs are being amortized over periods ranging from 11 to
    12 years. Benefits under all pension plans are valued based
    upon the projected unit credit cost method.



Certain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the
    long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for net periodic cost and benefit
    obligation. The assumed discount rates reflect the prevailing
    market rates of a universe of high-quality, non-callable,
    corporate bonds currently available that, if the obligation were
    settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary
    future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. The
    long-term rates of return on plan assets represents an estimate
    of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a
    mixture of equities, fixed income, cash and other investments
    similar to the actual investment mix. In determining the
    long-term return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term
    rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and
    forecasted) in which the Company expects the plan funds to be
    invested.

The Company has adopted a pension investment policy designed to
    meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets
    assumption. To achieve this, the pension plans retain
    professional investment managers that invest plan assets in
    equity and fixed income securities and cash. In addition, some
    plans invest in insurance contracts. The Company’s
    measurement date of its plan assets and obligations is
    December 31. The Company has the following target mixes for
    these asset classes, which are readjusted at least quarterly,
    when an asset class weighting deviates from the target mix, with
    the goal of achieving the required return at a reasonable risk
    level as follows:

    Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment
    policy provides for investments in a broad range of
    publicly-traded debt securities ranging from U.S. Treasury
    issues, corporate debt securities, mortgage and asset-backed
    securities, as well as international debt securities. In the
    cash and other investments asset class, investments may be in
    cash, cash equivalents or insurance contracts.

The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately
    $180 million to its U.S. pension plans and
    approximately $50 million to its

non-U.S. pension

Postretirement
    Health Care and Other Benefit Plans

Certain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic
    employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
    termination of employment (the “Postretirement Health Care
    Benefits Plan”). For eligible employees hired prior to
    January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
    postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
    January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefit
    Plan has been closed to new participants. The benefit obligation
    and plan assets for the Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan
    have been measured as of December 31, 2008.

    costs, currently included in Non-owner changes in equity, of
    $5 million.

The Company has adopted an investment policy for plan assets
    designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan
    assets assumption. To achieve this, the plan retains
    professional investment managers that invest plan assets in
    equity and fixed income securities and cash. The Company uses
    long-term historical actual return experience with consideration
    of the expected investment mix of the plans’ assets, as
    well as future estimates of long-term investment returns, to
    develop its expected rate of return assumption used in
    calculating the net periodic pension cost and the net retirement
    healthcare expense. The Company has the following target mixes
    for these asset classes, which are readjusted at least

    asset class, investments may be in cash and cash equivalents.

The Company expects to make no cash contributions to the retiree
    health care plan in 2009. The following benefit payments, which
    reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to
    be paid:

2014-2018


The health care trend rate used to determine the
    December 31, 2008 accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation is 8.5% for 2009. Beyond 2009, the rate is assumed to
    decrease by about 0.7% per year until it reaches 5% by 2014 and
    then remains flat. The health care trend rate used to determine
    the December 31, 2007 accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation was 9%.

Changing the health care trend rate by one percentage point
    would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation

The Company maintains a lifetime cap on postretirement health
    care costs, which reduces the liability duration of the plan. A
    result of this lower duration is a decreased sensitivity to a
    change in the discount rate trend assumption with respect to the
    liability and related expense.

The Company has no significant postretirement health care
    benefit plans outside the United States.

The Company maintains a number of endorsement split-dollar life
    insurance policies that were taken out on now-retired officers
    under a plan that was frozen prior to December 31, 2004.
    The Company had purchased the life insurance policies to insure
    the lives of employees and then entered into a separate
    agreement with the employees that split the policy benefits
    between the Company and the employee. Motorola owns the
    policies, controls all rights of ownership, and may terminate
    the insurance policies. To effect the split-dollar arrangement,
    Motorola endorsed a portion of the death benefits to the
    employee and upon the death of the employee, the employee’s
    beneficiary typically receives the designated portion of the
    death benefits directly from the insurance company and the
    Company receives the remainder of the death benefits.

The Company adopted the provisions of

EITF 06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-4”)

as of January 1, 2008.

EITF 06-4

requires that a liability for the benefit obligation be recorded
    because the promise of postretirement benefit had not been
    settled through the purchase of an endorsement split-dollar life
    insurance arrangement. As a result of the adoption of

EITF 06-4,

the Company recorded a liability representing the actuarial
    present value of the future death benefits as of the
    employees’ expected retirement date of $45 million
    with the offset reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment to
    January 1, 2008 Retained earnings and Non-owner changes to
    equity in the amounts of $4 million and $41 million,
    respectively, in the Company’s consolidated statement of
    stockholders’ equity. It is currently expected that no
    further cash payments are required to fund these policies.

The 2008 Split-Dollar Life Insurance policy actual expense was
    $6 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has
    recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of
    the future death benefits as of the employees’ expected
    retirement date of $47 million with the offset reflected in
    Retained earnings and Non-owner



changes to equity in the amounts of $4 million and
    $37 million, respectively, in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as of
    December 31, 2008.

Defined
    Contribution Plan

The Company and certain subsidiaries have various defined
    contribution plans, in which all eligible employees participate.
    In the U.S., the 401(k) plan is a contributory plan. Matching
    contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’
    contributions. Effective January 1, 2005, newly hired
    employees have a higher maximum matching contribution at 4% on
    the first 5% of employee contributions, compared to 3% on the
    first 6% of employee contributions for employees hired prior to
    January 2005. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company
    temporarily suspended all matching contributions to the Motorola
    401(k) plan. The Company’s expenses, primarily relating to
    the employer match, for all defined contribution plans, for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
    $95 million, $116 million and $105 million,
    respectively.

Share-Based
    Compensation Plans and Other Incentive Plans

Stock
    Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan

The Company grants options to acquire shares of common stock to
    certain employees, and existing option holders in connection
    with the merging of option plans following an acquisition. Each
    option granted has an exercise price of no less than 100% of the
    fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant.
    Option awards have a contractual life of five to ten years and
    vest over two to four years. For stock options and stock
    appreciation rights issued under plans prior to the 2006 Omnibus
    Plan, upon the occurrence of a change in control, each stock
    option and stock appreciation right outstanding on the date on
    which the change in control occurs will immediately become
    exercisable in full. Under the 2006 Omnibus Plan, the stock
    option or stock appreciation right only becomes exercisable if
    the holder is also involuntarily terminated within
    24 months of the change in control.

The Company grants stock appreciation rights to acquire shares
    of common stock to certain employees. Each stock appreciation
    right granted has an exercise price of 100% of the fair market
    value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Upon the
    occurrence of a change in control, each stock appreciation right
    outstanding on the date on which the change in control occurs
    will immediately become exercisable in full.

The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to
    purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through
    payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible compensation on an
    after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than
    $25,000 of stock in any calendar year. The price an employee
    pays per share is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
    the Company’s stock on the close of the first trading day
    or last trading day of the purchase period. The plan has two
    purchase periods, the first one from October 1 through March 31
    and the second one from April 1 through September 30. For
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, employees
    purchased 18.9 million, 10.2 million and
    8.3 million shares, respectively, at purchase prices of
    $7.91 and $6.07, $14.93 and $15.02, and $19.07 and $19.82,
    respectively.

The Company calculates the value of each employee stock option,
    estimated on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The weighted-average estimated fair value of
    employee stock options granted during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $3.47, $5.95 and $9.23, respectively, using the following
    weighted-average assumptions:

In 2006, the Company began using the implied volatility for
    traded options on the Company’s stock as the expected
    volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. The
    selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the
    availability of actively traded options on the Company’s
    stock and the Company’s assessment that implied volatility
    is more representative of future stock price trends than
    historical volatility.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the average
    daily closing rates during the year for U.S. treasury notes
    that have a life which approximates the expected life of the
    option. The dividend yield



assumption is based on the Company’s historical expectation
    of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options
    represents the weighted-average period the stock options are
    expected to remain outstanding based on the simplified method
    permitted under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110,
    “Shared-Based Payment”.

The Company has applied a forfeiture rate, estimated based on
    historical data, of 25%-35% to the option fair value calculated
    by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This estimated
    forfeiture rate may be revised in subsequent periods if actual
    forfeitures differ from this estimate.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $283 million of
    total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated
    forfeitures, related to stock option plans and the employee
    stock purchase plan that will be recognized over the weighted
    average period of approximately two years. Cash received from
    stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan was
    $145 million, $440 million and $918 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $2 million, $177 million and $568 million,
    respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options
    outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2008 was
    $1 million and $1 million, respectively, based on a
    December 31, 2008 stock price of $4.43 per share.

The significant decrease in the number of employees that were
    granted options in 2008 is due to the broad based equity grant
    being issued in restricted stock units.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, 72.2 million shares and
    88.0 million shares, respectively, were available for
    future share-based award grants under the 2006 Motorola Omnibus
    Plan, covering all equity awards to employees and non-employee
    directors.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock (“RS”) and restricted stock unit
    (“RSU”) grants consist of shares or the rights to
    shares of the Company’s common stock which are awarded to
    employees and non-employee directors. The grants are restricted
    such that they are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and
    to restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the employee.
    For shares of RS and RSUs issued under plans prior to the 2006
    Omnibus Plan, upon the occurrence of a change in control, the
    restrictions on all shares of RS and RSUs outstanding on the
    date on which the change in control occurs will lapse. Under the
    2006 Omnibus Plan, the shares of RS or RSUs only become
    exercisable if the holder is also involuntarily terminated
    within 24 months of the change in control.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had unrecognized
    compensation expense related to restricted stock units of
    $213 million, net of estimated forfeitures, expected to be
    recognized over the weighted average period of approximately
    three years. An aggregate of approximately 27.1 million,
    7.8 million and 2.8 million shares of restricted stock
    units were granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit
    shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006 was $19 million, $13 million and
    $22 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of
    outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2008
    was $143 million. The significant increase in the number of
    employees that were granted RSUs in 2008 is due to the broad
    based equity grant being issued in RSUs in lieu of stock options.

Motorola
    Incentive Plan

The Motorola Incentive Plan provides eligible employees with an
    annual payment, calculated as a percentage of an employee’s
    eligible earnings, in the year after the close of the current
    calendar year if specified business goals and individual
    performance targets are met. The provisions for awards under
    these incentive plans for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006 were $172 million, $190 million
    and $268 million, respectively.

Long-Range
    Incentive Plan

The Long-Range Incentive Plan (“LRIP”) rewards
    participating elected officers for the Company’s
    achievement of specified business goals during the period, based
    on two performance objectives measured over three-year cycles.
    The provision for LRIP (net of the reversals of previously
    recognized reserves) for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006 was $(13) million, $(8) million and
    $16 million, respectively. On April 21, 2008, the
    Compensation and Leadership Committee of the Board of Directors
    of Motorola, Inc. approved the cancellation of the

2006-2008

performance cycle and the

2007-2009

performance cycle under the Company’s Long Range Incentive
    Plan of 2006 without the payment of awards for such performance
    cycles, as reported on

Form 8-K,

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) on
    January 1, 2008 for all financial assets and liabilities
    and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.
    SFAS 157 does not change the accounting for those
    instruments that were, under previous GAAP, accounted for at
    cost or contract value. In February 2008, the FASB issued staff
    position

No. 157-2

(“FSP 157-2”),

which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 one year for
    all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except
    those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis. The Company has no
    non-financial assets and liabilities that are required to be
    measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
    December 31, 2008. Under

FSP 157-2,

the Company will apply the measurement criteria of SFAS 157
    to the remaining assets and liabilities no later than the first
    quarter of 2009.

The Company holds certain fixed income securities, equity
    securities and derivatives, which must be measured using the
    SFAS 157 prescribed fair value hierarchy and related
    valuation methodologies. SFAS 157 specifies a hierarchy of
    valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each
    measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs
    reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while
    unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about
    current market conditions. The prescribed fair value hierarchy
    and related valuation methodologies are as follows:

Level 1

—Quoted prices for identical instruments
    in active markets.

Level 2

—Quoted prices for similar instruments
    in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived
    valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in
    active markets.

Level 3

—Valuations derived from valuation
    techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are
    unobservable.



The levels of the Company’s financial assets and
    liabilities that are carried at fair value were as follows:

Valuation
    Methodologies

Quoted market prices in active markets are available for
    investments in common stock and equivalents and, as such, these
    investments are classified within Level 1.

The securities classified above as Level 2 are primarily
    those that are professionally managed within the Sigma Fund. The
    Company primarily relies on valuation pricing models and broker
    quotes to determine the fair value of investments in the Sigma
    Fund. The valuation models are developed and maintained by third
    party pricing services and use a number of standard inputs to
    the valuation model including benchmark yields, reported trades,
    broker/dealer quotes where the party is standing ready and able
    to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers
    and other reference data. The valuation model may prioritize
    these inputs differently at each balance sheet date for any
    given security, based on the market conditions. Not all of the
    standard inputs listed will be used each time in the valuation
    models. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to
    perceived market movements and sector news may be considered in
    addition to the standard inputs.

In determining the fair value of the Company’s interest
    rate swap derivatives, the Company uses the present value of
    expected cash flows based on market observable interest rate
    yield curves commensurate with the term of each instrument and
    the credit default swap market to reflect the credit risk of
    either the Company or the counterparty. For foreign currency
    derivatives, the Company’s approach is to use forward
    contract and option valuation models employing market observable
    inputs, such as spot currency rates, time value and option
    volatilities. Since the Company primarily uses observable inputs
    in its valuation of its derivative assets and liabilities, they
    are considered Level 2.

Level 3 fixed income securities are debt securities that do
    not have actively traded quotes on the date the Company presents
    its consolidated balance sheets and require the use of
    unobservable inputs, such as indicative quotes from dealers and
    qualitative input from investment advisors, to value these
    securities.

At December 31, 2008, the Company has $499 million of
    investments in money market mutual funds classified as Cash and
    cash equivalents in its consolidated balance sheets. The money
    market funds have quoted market prices that are generally
    equivalent to par.

Long-term
    Customer Financing and Sales of Receivables

Long-term
    Customer Financing

Long-term receivables consist of trade receivables with payment
    terms greater than twelve months, long-term loans and lease
    receivables under sales-type leases. Long-term receivables
    consist of the following:

$


The current portion of long-term receivables is included in
    Accounts receivable and the non-current portion of long-term
    receivables is included in Other assets in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. Interest income recognized on
    long-term receivables for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006 was $3 million, $7 million and
    $9 million, respectively.

Certain purchasers of the Company’s infrastructure
    equipment continue to request that suppliers provide long-term
    financing, defined as financing with terms greater than one
    year, in connection with equipment purchases. These requests may
    include all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment.
    However, the Company’s obligation to provide long-term
    financing is often conditioned on the issuance of a letter of
    credit in favor of the Company by a reputable bank to support
    the purchaser’s credit or a pre-existing commitment from a
    reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from the
    Company. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide
    long-term financing to third parties totaling $370 million
    and $610 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Of these amounts, $266 million and
    $454 million were supported by letters of credit or by bank
    commitments to purchase long-term receivables at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In response to
    the recent tightening in the credit markets, certain customers
    of the Company have requested financing in connection with
    equipment purchases, and these types of requests have increased
    in volume and scope.

In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment
    customers, the Company also assists customers in obtaining
    financing directly from banks and other sources to fund
    equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide
    financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling
    $43 million and $42 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively (including $23 million at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 relating to the sale of
    short-term receivables). Customer financing guarantees
    outstanding were $6 million and $3 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (including
    $4 million and $0 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term
    receivables).

Sales
    of Receivables

The Company sells accounts receivables and long-term receivables
    to third parties in transactions that qualify as
    “true-sales.” Certain of these accounts receivables
    and long-term receivables are sold to third parties on a
    one-time, non-recourse basis, while others are sold to third
    parties under committed facilities that involve contractual
    commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying
    receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
    facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be
    renewed on an annual basis. The Company may or may not retain
    the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and
    long-term receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2008, these committed
    facilities provided for up to $967 million to be
    outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
    up to $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion provided at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, $759 million of the Company’s
    committed facilities were utilized, compared to
    $497 million and $817 million utilized at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of the
    $967 million of committed facilities at December 31, 2008,
    $532 million were primarily revolving facilities associated with
    the sale of accounts receivables (of which $497 million was
    utilized at December 31, 2008) and $435 million were primarily
    committed facilities associated with the sale of specific
    long-term financing transactions to a single customer (of which
    $262 million was utilized at December 31, 2008). In addition,
    before receivables can be sold under certain of the revolving
    committed facilities, they may need to meet contractual
    requirements, such as credit quality or insurability.



For many years the Company has utilized a number of receivables
    programs to sell a broadly-diversified group of accounts
    receivables to third parties. Certain of the accounts
    receivables are sold to a multi-seller commercial paper conduit.
    This program provided for up to $400 million of accounts
    receivables to be outstanding with the conduit at any time.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2008, this $400 million
    committed facility expired and the Company is negotiating a
    replacement facility under different terms. The Company is also
    negotiating an additional committed revolving receivable sales
    facility for European receivables, with the intent that the
    combined capacity of the two new facilities will be greater than
    the facility that expired. However, it is not certain when or if
    the Company will be successful in securing such facilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total
    accounts receivables and long-term receivables sold by the
    Company were $3.7 billion, $4.9 billion and
    $6.4 billion, respectively (including $3.4 billion,
    $4.7 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, of
    accounts receivables). As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    there were $1.0 billion and $978 million,
    respectively, of receivables outstanding under these programs
    for which the Company retained servicing obligations (including
    $621 million and $587 million, respectively, of
    accounts receivable).

Under certain receivables programs, the value of the receivables
    sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from independent
    insurance companies, less deductibles or self-insurance
    requirements under the policies (with the Company retaining
    credit exposure for the remaining portion). The Company’s
    total credit exposure to outstanding short-term receivables that
    have been sold was $23 million at both December 31,
    2008 and 2007. Reserves of $4 million and $1 million
    were recorded for potential losses at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Legal

Iridium Program:

The Company was named as one
    of several defendants in putative class action securities
    lawsuits arising out of alleged misrepresentations or omissions
    regarding the Iridium satellite communications business which,
    on March 15, 2001, were consolidated in the federal
    district court in the District of Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications, Inc., et al.,

originally filed on April 22, 1999. In April 2008, the
    parties reached an agreement in principle, subject to court
    approval, to settle all claims against Motorola in exchange for
    Motorola’s payment of $20 million. During the three
    months ended March 29, 2008, the Company recorded a charge
    associated with this settlement. On October 23, 2008, the
    court granted final approval of the settlement and dismissed the
    claims with prejudice.

The Company was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
    Creditors of Iridium (the “Committee”) in the United
    States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
    (the “Iridium Bankruptcy Court”) on July 19,
    2001.

In re Iridium Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserted claims for breach of contract, warranty and
    fiduciary duty and fraudulent transfer and preferences, and
    sought in excess of $4 billion in damages. On May 20,
    2008, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement in which
    Motorola is not required to pay anything, but released its
    administrative, priority and unsecured claims against the
    Iridium estate and withdrew its objection to the 2001 settlement
    between the unsecured creditors of the Iridium Debtors and the
    Iridium Debtors’ pre-petition secured lenders. This
    settlement, and its approval by the Bankruptcy Court,
    extinguished Motorola’s financial exposure and concluded
    Motorola’s involvement in the Iridium bankruptcy
    proceedings.

Telsim Class Action Securities:

In April
    2007, the Company entered into a settlement agreement in regards
    to

In re Motorola Securities Litigation

, a class action
    lawsuit relating to the Company’s disclosure of its
    relationship with Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
    Pursuant to the settlement, Motorola paid $190 million to
    the class and all claims against Motorola by the class have been
    dismissed and released.

During the three months ended March 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded a charge of $190 million for the legal settlement,
    partially offset by $75 million of estimated insurance
    recoveries, of which $50 million had been tendered by
    certain insurance carriers. During the three months ended
    June 30, 2007, the Company commenced actions against the
    non-tendering insurance carriers. In response to these actions,
    each insurance carrier who has responded denied coverage citing
    various policy provisions. As a result of this denial of
    coverage and related actions, the Company recorded a reserve of
    $25 million in the three months ended June 30, 2007
    against the receivable from insurance carriers. During the three
    months ended September 27, 2008, the Company received the
    $50 million tendered by the insurance carriers. During the
    three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company received
    a net $43 million tendered by other insurance carriers.



Other:

The Company is a defendant in various
    other suits, claims and investigations that arise in the normal
    course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
    disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or results of operations.

Other

Leases:

The Company owns most of its major
    facilities and leases certain office, factory and warehouse
    space, land, and information technology and other equipment
    under principally non-cancelable operating leases. Rental
    expense, net of sublease income, for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $181 million,
    $231 million and $241 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008, future minimum lease obligations, net of
    minimum sublease rentals, for the next five years and beyond are
    as follows: 2009—$234 million;
    2010—$175 million; 2011—$129 million;
    2012—$78 million; 2013—$48 million;
    beyond—$106 million.

Indemnifications:

The Company is also a party
    to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to
    indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Some
    of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of the
    Company’s assets or businesses and require the Company to
    hold the other party harmless against losses arising from the
    settlement of these pending obligations. The total amount of
    indemnification under these types of provisions is
    $64 million, of which the Company accrued $47 million
    as of December 31, 2008 for potential claims under these
    provisions.

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses
    that result from the breach of general warranties contained in
    certain commercial and intellectual property. Historically, the
    Company has not made significant payments under these
    agreements. However, there is an increasing risk in relation to
    patent indemnities given the current legal climate.

In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned
    on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
    specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically
    allow the Company to challenge the other party’s claims.
    Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements
    for indemnification based on breach of representations and
    warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, and for
    amounts not in excess of the contract value, and, in some
    instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties
    for certain payments made by the Company.

Other:

During the three months ended
    September 27, 2008, the Company recorded a
    $150 million charge related to the settlement of a purchase
    commitment. During the three months ended December 31,
    2007, the Company recorded a $277 million charge for a
    legal settlement.

Reorganization
    of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
    “Severance Plan”), which permits the Company to offer
    eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
    and employment grade level in the event that employment is
    involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in-force

or restructuring. The Company recognizes termination benefits
    based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time
    that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably
    estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a
    restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs consist
    of future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other
    contractual terminations. At each reporting date, the Company
    evaluates its accruals for employee separation and exit costs to
    ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain
    circumstances, accruals are no longer needed because of
    efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees
    previously identified for separation resigned from the Company
    and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to
    circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
    initiated. In these cases, the Company reverses accruals through
    the consolidated statements of operations where the original
    charges were recorded when it is determined they are no longer
    needed.

    Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    committed to implement various productivity improvement plans
    aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by
    driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. All three of
    the Company’s business segments, as well as corporate
    functions, are impacted by these plans, with the majority of the
    impact in the Mobile Devices segment. The employees affected are
    located in all regions. The Company recorded net reorganization
    of business charges of $334 million, including
    $86 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $248 million of charges under Other charges in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Included
    in the aggregate $334 million are charges of
    $324 million for employee separation costs,
    $66 million for exit costs and $9 million for fixed
    asset impairment charges, partially offset by $65 million
    of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

Exit
    Costs

At January 1, 2008, the Company had an accrual of
    $42 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2008 additional charges of $66 million
    are primarily related to: (i) the exit of leased facilities
    in the United Kingdom by the Mobile Devices segment, and
    (ii) the exit of leased facilities in Mexico by the Home
    and Networks Mobility segment. The adjustments of
    $1 million reflect $4 million of translation
    adjustments, partially offset by $3 million of reversals of
    accruals no longer needed. The $29 million used in 2008
    reflects cash payments. The remaining accrual of
    $80 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2008, represents future cash payments,
    primarily for lease termination obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2008, the Company had an accrual of
    $193 million for employee separation costs, representing
    the severance costs for approximately 2,800 employees. The
    2008 additional charges of $324 million represent severance
    costs for approximately an additional 5,800 employees, of
    which 2,300 are direct employees and 3,500 are indirect
    employees.

The adjustments of $60 million reflect $62 million of
    reversals of accruals no longer needed, partially offset by
    $2 million of translation adjustments. The $62 million
    of reversals represent previously accrued costs for
    approximately 600 employees.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately
    6,200 employees, of which 3,000 were direct employees and
    3,200 were indirect employees, were separated from the Company.
    The $287 million used in 2008 reflects cash payments to
    these separated employees. The remaining accrual of
    $170 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2008, is expected to be paid to approximately
    2,000 employees.

    Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    committed to implement various productivity improvement plans
    aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by
    driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. All three of
    the Company’s business segments, as well as corporate
    functions, are impacted by these plans. The majority of the
    employees affected are located in North America and Europe. The
    Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of
    $394 million, including $104 million of charges in
    Costs of sales and $290 million of charges under Other
    charges (income) in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of



operations. Included in the aggregate $394 million are
    charges of $401 million for employee separation costs,
    $42 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
    $19 million for exit costs, offset by reversals for
    accruals no longer needed.

Exit
    Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $54 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2007 additional charges of $19 million
    are primarily related to the exit of certain activities and
    leased facilities in Ireland by the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment. The 2007 adjustments of $2 million represent
    accruals for exit costs established through purchase accounting
    for businesses acquired. The $33 million used in 2007
    reflects cash payments. The remaining accrual of
    $42 million, which was included in Accrued liabilities in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007, represented future cash payments for
    lease termination obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of
    $104 million for employee separation costs, representing
    the severance costs for approximately 2,300 employees. The
    2007 additional charges of $401 million represent severance
    costs for approximately 6,700 employees, of which 2,400
    were direct employees and 4,300 were indirect employees.

The adjustments of $64 million reflect $68 million of
    reversals of accruals no longer needed, partially offset by
    $4 million of accruals for severance plans established
    through purchase accounting for businesses acquired. The
    $68 million of reversals represent previously accrued costs
    for 1,100 employees, and primarily relates to a strategic
    change regarding a plant closure and specific employees
    previously identified for separation who resigned from the
    Company and did not receive severance or who were redeployed due
    to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
    approved. The $4 million of accruals represents severance
    plans for approximately 200 employees established through
    purchase accounting for businesses acquired.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately
    5,300 employees, of which 1,700 were direct employees and
    3,600 were indirect employees, were separated from the Company.
    The $248 million used in 2007 reflects cash payments to
    these separated employees. The remaining accrual of
    $193 million is included in Accrued liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
    2007.



    Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    committed to implement various productivity improvement plans
    aimed principally at: (i) reducing costs in its
    supply-chain activities, (ii) integration synergies, and
    (iii) reducing other operating expenses, primarily relating
    to engineering and development costs. The Company recorded net
    reorganization of business charges of $213 million,
    including $41 million of charges in Costs of sales and
    $172 million of charges under Other charges in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Included
    in the aggregate $213 million are charges of
    $191 million for employee separation costs,
    $15 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
    $30 million for exit costs, partially offset by
    $23 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $50 million for exit costs attributable to lease
    terminations. The 2006 additional charges of $30 million
    were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Enterprise
    Mobility Solutions segment. The 2006 adjustments of
    $7 million represent reversals of accruals no longer
    needed. The $19 million used in 2006 reflects cash payments
    to lessors. The remaining accrual of $54 million, which was
    included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006,
    represented future cash payments for lease termination
    obligations.

Employee
    Separation Costs

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
    $53 million for employee separation costs, representing the
    severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees, of which
    1,100 were direct employees and 500 were indirect employees. The
    2006 additional charges of $191 million represented costs
    for an additional 3,900 employees, of which 1,700 were
    direct employees and 2,200 were indirect employees. The
    adjustments of $16 million represented reversals of
    accruals no longer needed.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately
    3,200 employees, of which 1,400 were direct employees and
    1,800 were indirect employees, were separated from the Company.
    The $124 million used in 2006 reflects cash payments to
    these separated employees. The remaining accrual of
    $104 million was included in Accrued liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
    2006.



14.

Acquisitions
    and Related Intangibles

The Company accounts for acquisitions using purchase accounting
    with the results of operations for each acquiree included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for the period
    subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of
    these acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements were not significant individually nor in the
    aggregate.

The allocation of value to in-process research and development
    was determined using expected future cash flows discounted at
    average risk adjusted rates reflecting both technological and
    market risk as well as the time value of money. Historical
    pricing, margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used
    in the valuation of the in-process products. The in-process
    research and development acquired will have no alternative
    future uses if the products are not feasible.

The developmental products for the companies acquired have
    varying degrees of timing, technology, costs-to-complete and
    market risks throughout final development. If the products fail
    to become viable, the Company will unlikely be able to realize
    any value from the sale of incomplete technology to another
    party or through internal re-use. The risks of market acceptance
    for the products under development and potential reductions in
    projected sales volumes and related profits in the event of
    delayed market availability for any of the products exist.
    Efforts to complete all developmental products continue and
    there are no known delays to forecasted plans except as
    disclosed.

The Company did not have any significant acquisitions during the
    year ended December 31, 2008. The following is a summary of

Symbol
    Technologies, Inc.

In January 2007, the Company acquired, for $3.5 billion in
    net cash, the outstanding common stock of Symbol Technologies,
    Inc. (“Symbol”), a leader in designing, developing,
    manufacturing and servicing products and systems used in
    end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions featuring rugged mobile
    computing, advanced data capture, radio frequency identification
    (“RFID”), wireless infrastructure and mobility
    management.



The fair value of acquired in-process research and development
    was $95 million. The acquired in-process research and
    development will have no alternative future uses if the products
    are not feasible and, as such, costs were expensed at the date
    of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, 31 projects were in
    process and were completed through 2008. The average risk
    adjusted rate used to value these projects is

15-16%.

The
    allocation of value to in-process research and development was
    determined using expected future cash flows discounted at
    average risk adjusted rates reflecting both technological and
    market risk as well as the time value of money.

The fair value of the acquired intangible assets was
    $1.0 billion at the time of acquisition. Intangible assets
    are included in Other assets in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. The intangible assets are being amortized over
    periods ranging from 1 to 8 years on a straight-line
    basis. The Company recorded $2.3 billion of goodwill, none
    of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The results of the operations of Symbol have been included in
    the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of
    acquisition. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements were not
    significant.

Good
    Technology, Inc.

In January 2007, the Company acquired Good Technology, Inc.
    (“Good”), a provider of enterprise mobile computing
    software and services, for $438 million in net cash. The
    Company recorded $296 million in goodwill, none of which is
    expected to be deductible for tax purposes and $158 million
    in identifiable intangible assets. However, due to recent
    changes in software platform strategy, impairment charges of
    $123 million were recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, representing write-downs of:
    (i) $121 million of intangible assets, primarily
    relating to completed technology and other intangibles, and
    (ii) $2 million of property, plant and equipment.

The results of operations of Good have been included in the
    Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of
    acquisition. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements were not
    significant.

Netopia,
    Inc.

In February 2007, the Company acquired Netopia, Inc.
    (“Netopia”), a broadband equipment provider for DSL
    customers, which allows for phone, TV and fast Internet
    connections, for $183 million in net cash. The Company
    recorded $61 million in goodwill, none of which is expected
    to be deductible for tax purposes, and $100 million in
    identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets are included
    in Other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period
    of 7 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of Netopia have been included in the
    Home and Networks Mobility segment in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of
    acquisition. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements were not
    significant.

Terayon
    Communication Systems, Inc.

In July 2007, the Company acquired Terayon Communication
    Systems, Inc. (“Terayon”), a provider of real-time
    digital video networking applications to cable, satellite and
    telecommunication service providers worldwide, for
    $137 million in net cash. The Company recorded
    $21 million in goodwill, none of which is expected to be
    deductible for tax purposes, and $52 million in
    identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets are included
    in Other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. The intangible assets are being amortized over periods
    ranging from 4 to 6 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of Terayon have been included in the

    are not feasible. At the date of the acquisition, two projects
    were in process. During the year ended December 31, 2008,
    one of the projects was completed while the other project was
    abandoned. The average risk adjusted rate used to value this
    project was 22%. The allocation of value to in-process research
    and development was determined using expected future cash flows
    discounted at average risk adjusted rates reflecting both
    technological and market risk as well as the time value of
    money. These research and development costs were expensed at the
    date of acquisition. Intangible assets are included in Other
    assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The
    intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from
    3 to 5 years on a straight-line basis.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    finalized its assessment of the Internal Revenue Code
    Section 382 Limitations (“IRC Section 382”)
    relating to the pre-acquisition tax loss carry-forwards of its
    2007 acquisitions. As a result of the IRC Section 382
    studies, the company recorded additional deferred tax assets and
    a corresponding reduction in goodwill, which is reflected in the
    adjustment column above.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we conducted our annual
    assessment of goodwill for impairment. The Company performed
    extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market
    approaches, in our goodwill



assessment process. The goodwill impairment test is performed at
    the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating
    segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company has
    determined that the Mobile Devices segment meets the requirement
    of a reporting unit. For the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
    segment, the Company has identified two reporting units, the
    Government and Public Safety reporting unit and the Enterprise
    Mobility reporting unit. For the Home and Networks Mobility
    segment, the Company has identified two reporting units, the
    Home reporting unit and the Public Networks reporting unit.

During this quarter, we experienced a sustained, significant
    decline in our stock price that reduced the market
    capitalization below the book value of the Company. The reduced
    market capitalization reflected the macroeconomic declines
    coupled with the market view on the performance of the Mobile
    Devices reporting unit. The Company has considered this decline
    in our stock price in our impairment assessment.

The Company has weighted the valuation of its reporting units at
    75% based on the income approach and 25% based on the market
    based approach consistent with prior periods. The Company
    believes that this weighting is appropriate since it is often
    difficult to find other appropriate market participants that are
    similar to our reporting units and the Company view of future
    discounted cash flows is more reflective of the value of the
    reporting units. If a heavier weighting was put on the market
    based approach for certain reporting units, a higher fair value
    would have been determined.

The determination of fair value of the reporting units and other
    assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires us to
    make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
    assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the
    discount rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before
    depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures
    forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making
    these estimates, actual results could differ from those
    estimates. The Company assigned discount rates ranging from 13
    to 14% for the Home, Public Networks, Government and Public
    Safety and Enterprise Mobility Reporting units. The Company
    assigned a discount rate of 25% to the Mobile Devices reporting
    unit commensurate with development stage enterprises or
    turnaround opportunities. The Company believes this rate
    reflects the inherent uncertainties of the Mobile Devices
    reporting unit’s projected cash flows. The Company
    evaluated the merits of each significant assumption, both
    individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair
    value of the reporting units, as well as the fair values of the
    corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units,
    and concluded they are reasonable.

Based on the results of Step One of our annual assessment of the
    recoverability goodwill, the fair values of the Home, Public
    Networks and Government and Public Safety reporting units
    exceeded their book value, indicating that there was no
    impairment of goodwill at these reporting units.

However, the fair value of the Enterprise Mobility and Mobile
    Devices reporting units was below their respective book values,
    indicating a potential impairment of goodwill and the
    requirement to perform Step Two of the analysis for these
    reporting units. The Company acquired the main components of the
    Enterprise Mobility reporting unit in 2007 at which time the
    book value and fair value of the reporting unit was the same.
    Because of this fact, the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit was
    most likely to experience a decline in its fair value below its
    book value as a result of lower values in the overall market and
    the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and the
    market’s view of its near term impact on the reporting
    unit. The decline in the fair value of the Mobile Devices
    reporting unit below its book value is a result of the
    deteriorating macroeconomic environment, lower expected sales
    and cash flows as a result of the decision to consolidate
    platforms announced in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the
    uncertainty around the reporting unit’s future cash flow.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    determined that goodwill relating to the Enterprise Mobility
    Solution and Mobile Devices segments were impaired, resulting in
    charges of $1.6 billion and $55 million, respectively.
    Additional impairment charges could be recognized in the near
    term if the Company’s market capitalization continues to
    decline or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate. No
    impairment charges were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Item 9: Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A: Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior
    management, including our chief executive officers and chief
    financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered
    by this annual report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based
    on this evaluation, our chief executive officers and chief
    financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the
    information relating to Motorola, including our consolidated
    subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is
    accumulated and communicated to Motorola’s management,
    including our chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Motorola’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our senior management, including our chief
    executive officers and chief financial officer, we assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008, using the criteria set forth in
    the

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is
    effective as of December 31, 2008. The Company’s
    independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has
    issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of
    internal control over financial reporting appears in this

Form 10-K.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over
    financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2008 that have materially affected or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
    financial reporting.

    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We have audited Motorola Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Motorola Inc.’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Motorola, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
    as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
    ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated
    February 26, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements.
