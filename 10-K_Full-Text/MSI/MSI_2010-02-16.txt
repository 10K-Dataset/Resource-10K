Business Segments

We report financial results for the following three operating business segments:

Mobile Devices Segment

The Mobile Devices segment ("Mobile Devices" or the "segment") designs, manufactures, sells and services wireless handsets, including
smartphones, with integrated software and accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. In 2009, the segment's net sales represented 32% of the Company's consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

Our wireless subscriber products include wireless handsets and related software and accessory products. We also license our
intellectual property. We market our products globally to carriers and consumers through direct sales, distributors and retailers.



Our Industry

In 2009, total industry shipments of wireless handsets decreased approximately 6% compared to 2008, primarily as a result of the global
economic downturn. This was the first annual decline in handset industry unit shipments since 2001. The economic downturn resulted in slower growth in the emerging
markets and lower replacement sales in highly-penetrated markets, primarily in the U.S. and Western Europe. By the fourth quarter of 2009, the industry began showing signs of recovery with positive
quarterly year-over-year growth.

With
many customers maintaining tight inventory management during 2009, a strengthening global economy and improving consumer demand, the recent handset market recovery is expected to
continue through 2010. Analysts are predicting total industry handset shipments to increase approximately 9% (on average) for the full-year 2010 compared to 2009. Growth is expected to be
driven from new subscribers in emerging markets and increasing demand for smartphones.

Smartphones
are expected to be the fastest growing and the most profitable segment of the mobile handset industry over the next several years. Key drivers of this growth include:
(i) consumer desires for feature-rich devices that provide access to mobile Internet, media, social networking, navigation and messaging at anytime and anyplace,
(ii) operators drive to increase data ARPU (average revenue per user) to offset declining voice ARPU, (iii) the trend toward open operating systems that provide computer-like
functionality to handsets, and (iv) the evolution of networks to support high-speed Internet access (3G and 4G).

Our Strategy

The Mobile Devices segment is focused on delivering compelling, mobile experiences to consumers while becoming the hub of people's
lives and the gateway to the mobile Internet. With the Android operating platform and our MOTOBLUR

TM

software solution and MotoDEV application development program, we intend to provide
applications and services to support end-to-end, customizable solutions desired by consumers.

As
the market evolves to reflect the emergence of converged wireless devices, mobile Internet, media/video, social networking, navigation and messaging, the shift from voice-centric
devices to data-centric devices continues to accelerate. These devices, which include smartphones developed on open platforms, deliver unique consumer experiences and require complete
end-to-end solutions that incorporate various applications and services. By utilizing the smartphone, we are able to deliver computer-like functionality, such as
web browsing and email, across our portfolio. We believe that open platforms foster innovation and encourage the development of applications suited to consumers, wherever they are located.

Our
primary smartphone development is based on the Android operating system (a Google-developed, royalty-free open platform). The Android platform is a modular operating
system which enables multiple simultaneous operations. It provides a well-developed ecosystem that continues to grow with a broad range of applications.

We
are differentiating our Android smartphone experience through our unique MOTOBLUR software solution. MOTOBLUR utilizes cloud-based services to help ensure that our users digital lives
can be accessed from anywhere. It combines content-forward, deeply integrated software applications and a unique interface with a server-based back-end solution that gathers, organizes and
delivers fresh content and data automatically. In addition to MOTOBLUR, we are enabling third-party solutions through our MotoDEV
application development programs. MotoDEV leverages partner ecosystems to deliver customizable content to consumers. This content can be pre-loaded, embedded or downloaded on
Android-powered devices. In some markets, as in China, we offer our SHOP4APPS application store to provide consumers additional applications and service choices.

As
the segment creates stronger software solutions and capabilities, we continue to invest in next-generation technologies for wireless devices based on High-Speed Downlink
Packet Access (HSDPA) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE). These investments provide opportunities to differentiate our products as we develop smartphones that support the migration toward
higher network bandwidth.

In
addition to our smartphone portfolio and focus on delivering key experiences, we are also (i) maintaining our technological leadership in our proprietary iDEN technology,
(ii) focusing on priority markets, (iii) selectively offering voice-centric devices through third-party original design manufacturer ("ODM") development, and (iv) leveraging
companion products to deliver complete mobile experiences.



The
Mobile Devices segment continues to maintain a strong market position with its iDEN technology. Increased demand in North America, as well as internationally, drove iDEN growth in
2009. Our iDEN strategy aligns with our focus on priority regions.

We
are increasing our focus in priority markets, which include North America, parts of Asia, including China, and Latin America. Historically, these are regions in which we have
experienced strong market share and brand position. In other regions, we will prioritize and make investments commensurate with the competitiveness of our portfolio. In the long term, we plan to
compete in all major markets. In order to successfully compete in our prioritized regions, maintain brand awareness and provide products at multiple price points, we are working with ODM partners to
generate lower-end, voice-centric devices. Along with our mobile handset initiatives, we will leverage our companion products portfolio to extend smartphone experiences through companion
devices.

Customers

The segment has several large customers located throughout the world. In 2009, aggregate net sales to the segment's five largest
customers represented approximately 54% of the segment's net sales. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the segment's business. In addition to selling
directly to carriers and operators, our Mobile Devices business also sells products through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers, which accounted for approximately 21% of the segment's
net sales in 2009.

Beginning
in late 2008 and throughout 2009, uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions caused our customers to maintain tighter inventory management. We expect this
inventory management trend to continue in 2010.

The
U.S. market continued to be the segment's largest individual market, accounting for approximately 58% of the segment's net sales in 2009, compared to approximately 44% of the
segment's net sales in 2008. In 2009, the segment's largest markets outside the U.S. were Brazil, China, Mexico and Korea. In 2009 compared to 2008, the segment experienced sales declines in each of
its four major sales regions: North America; the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") region; Asia and Latin America.

Competition

The wireless handset market is highly competitive and many new competitors have entered the market in the last several years. As the
market continues to move toward smartphones, this trend may result in even more competition.

The
segment experiences increasingly intense competition in worldwide markets from numerous global competitors. In 2009, the three largest handset manufacturers together held an
aggregate market share of approximately 69%. In addition, non-traditional device manufacturers continue to enter the marketplace while second-tier vendors, in regions such as
Asia, provide another layer of competition.

In
2009, the segment's overall market share decreased significantly and the segment was the fifth-largest worldwide supplier of wireless handsets on a full-year basis.

General
competitive factors in the market for the segment's products include: overall quality of user experience; design; time-to-market; brand awareness;
technology offered; price; product features; performance; quality; delivery and warranty; the quality and availability of service; and relationships with key customers.

Payment Terms

The segment's customers and distributors buy from us regularly with payment terms that are competitive with current industry practices.
These terms vary globally and generally range from cash-with-order to 60 days. Extended payment terms beyond 60 days are provided to certain customers on a
limited basis. A customer's outstanding credit at any point in time is limited to a predetermined amount as established by the Company.

Regulatory Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal communications industry may be affected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or,
alternatively, if new technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use. Industry



growth
may also be affected by the cost of the new licenses required to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The
U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other new
technologies. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

Backlog

The segment's backlog (excluding any deferred revenue) was $409 million at December 31, 2009, compared to
$290 million at December 31, 2008. This increase in backlog is primarily due to demand for our smartphones that were launched in the fourth quarter of 2009. The 2009 backlog is believed
to be generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2010. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the
amount recognized to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment's operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its
products, technologies and manufacturing processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Motorola is also licensed to use certain
patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses. The protection of these
licenses is also important to the segment's operations. For additional information relating to patents and
trademarks and research and development activities with respect to this segment, see the discussion under "Other Information."

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment's practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory in manufacturing and distribution centers in order to meet customer
delivery requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2009, the segment had a significantly lower inventory balance than at the end of 2008. The decrease reflects lower
sales requirements and significant improvements in inventory management processes.

Availability
of materials and components required by the segment is relatively dependable; however, fluctuations in supply and market demand could cause selective shortages and affect
results. We currently source certain materials and components from single vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact the
segment's financial results.

Natural
gas, electricity, and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy required for the segment's manufacturing operations. Each of these resources are currently in
generally adequate supply for the segment's operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices, which steadily increased during 2009 and
impacted our manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the segment's manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the
aforementioned resources or a significant cost increase could affect the segment's results.

The
segment permits returns under limited circumstances to remain competitive with current industry practices.

The
segment typically experiences higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter and lower sales in the first calendar quarter of each year due to seasonal trends in the wireless handset
industry.

Our Facilities/Manufacturing

The segment's headquarters are located in Libertyville, Illinois. Our other major facilities are located in Beijing and Tianjin, China;
Jaguariuna, Brazil; Seoul, South Korea; and Plantation, Florida.

A
significant portion of our handsets are manufactured either completely or substantially by a small number of electronics manufacturing suppliers ("EMSs") and ODMs. The segment relies
on these third-party providers to deliver products that meet consumer demands in the rapidly-changing technological environment. In 2009, our



handsets
were primarily manufactured in China and Brazil, and we expect this to continue in 2010. Our largest manufacturing facilities are located in China and Brazil. Each of these facilities serves
multiple countries and regions of the world.

Home and Networks Mobility Segment

The Home and Networks Mobility segment ("Home and Networks Mobility" or the "segment") designs, manufactures, sells, installs and
services: (i) digital video, Internet Protocol ("IP") video and broadcast network interactive set-tops ("digital entertainment devices"), end-to-end video
distribution systems, broadband access infrastructure platforms, and associated data and voice customer premise equipment ("broadband gateways") to cable television and telecom service providers
(collectively, referred to as the "home business"), and (ii) wireless access systems ("wireless networks"), including cellular infrastructure systems and wireless broadband systems, to wireless
service providers (collectively, referred to as the "networks business"). In 2009, the segment's net sales represented 36% of the Company's consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

In the home business, the segment is a leading provider of end-to-end networks used for the delivery of video,
data and voice services over hybrid fiber coaxial ("HFC") networks, digital subscriber line ("DSL") networks and passive optical networks ("PON"). Our portfolio includes: MPEG video
encoding equipment for standard-definition and high-definition television ("HDTV" or "HD"); video processing and multiplexing systems; and video-on-demand, switched
digital video and conditional access systems used by network operators and programmers to deliver video programming. We provide a broad array of digital entertainment devices supporting analog,
digital and IP video delivery, including HD and digital video recording ("DVR") (together, "HD/DVR") applications. We support the delivery of high-speed data and voice services with
head-end and central office equipment, along with data and voice modems and gateways for HFC and DSL networks and optical line and optical node terminals for PON networks.

In
the networks business, the segment provides end-to-end cellular networks, including radio base stations, base station controllers, associated software and
services, application platforms and third-party switching for CDMA, GSM, iDEN® and UMTS technologies. The segment also offers a portfolio of WiMAX products and is in trials with customers
to provide our LTE technology to enable next-generation mobile IP broadband access. WiMAX and LTE will make mobile bandwidth more affordable and accessible for mainstream consumer
adoption.

Our
products are marketed primarily to cable television operators, telecom operators, wireless service providers, television programmers and other communications providers worldwide and
are sold primarily by our internal sales force.

Our Industry

The home market continues to evolve rapidly as cable and telecom network operators expand video, data, voice and mobile services to
create "triple play" or "quad play" bundles to grow their subscriber base. The competition between cable and telecom service providers continues to increase. Telecom operators are expanding their
broadband networks by offering advanced video and data services using IPTV and PON technologies in a growing number of markets. Cable operators are responding by increasing their HD programming,
bundling voice-over-IP services, expanding their broadband data service through Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications ("DOCSIS") 3.0 channel bonding, and beginning
to launch mobile data services.

Our
home business is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") in the United States and other governmental communication regulators throughout the world. FCC
regulations requiring separation of security functionality from cable set-tops became effective in 2007. This has resulted in increased competition for sales of set-top boxes
to cable operators and has enabled retail distribution of televisions and other video devices capable of accessing encrypted cable programming. Our home business offers a cablecard that allows
third-party consumer electronic devices to be deployed on an operator's network using the Motorola conditional access system. Motorola also offers a portfolio of cable card host set-tops
that allows our digital video set-tops to be deployed in service provider networks using third-party encryption technology.



In 2009, the overall market for the home business declined as operators constrained spending due to difficult macroeconomic conditions and the resulting slowdown
in data and digital video subscriber additions, particularly in more mature markets. Declines in spending primarily occurred for infrastructure products, data consumer premise equipment (CPE) products
and digital set-tops in North America. These market declines were partially offset by increases in international sales of IP set-tops. Spending will be influenced by video and
data subscribers' increasing demand for advanced video platforms and applications, as well as from telecom operators' upgrading their networks and adding video services. The growth of broadband
connectivity is expected to continue as demand for high-speed data causes cable operators to upgrade to DOCSIS 3.0 and telecom service providers to deploy very high speed digital subscriber line
("VDSL") and PON data services.

In
the wireless networks market, the majority of installed cellular infrastructure systems are based on CDMA, GSM, UMTS and iDEN technologies. We supply systems based on each of these
technologies and are the sole supplier of proprietary iDEN networks. Advanced infrastructure systems based on these technologies include GPRS, CDMA-1X and EDGE. In addition, many
cellular service providers have migrated to 3G networks, which are high-capacity radio access wireless networks providing enhanced data services, improved Internet access and increased
voice capacity. The primary 3G technologies are W-CDMA (based on either UMTS or Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access ("FOMA") technologies) and CDMA 2000 1xEVDO. We supply 3G systems based
on UMTS and CDMA 2000 1xEVDO technologies. An additional 3G technology standard, TD-SCDMA, has been driven primarily by the Chinese government and local Chinese vendors. China's Ministry
of Industry and Information Technology has assigned 3G licenses for three different 3G standards, driving regional network upgrades.

The
International Telecommunications Union ("ITU") that develops the global framework for information and communications networks has established performance requirements for its
IMT-Advanced standard, commonly referred as 4

th

generation (4G) wireless access. Standards bodies are developing specifications to meet the 4G requirements based on
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ("OFDM") technology which will utilize wider channels and offer higher data rates to expand broadband access offerings. Today, the standards bodies are
evolving the WiMAX and LTE standards towards meeting the IMT-Advanced specifications. The 3

rd

Generation Partnership Project ("3GPP"), which defined the industry's GSM
specifications, is developing an LTE-Advanced standard to address the IMT-Advanced requirements. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ("IEEE"), which defined
standards known as fixed WiMAX (802.16d) and mobile WiMAX (802.16e), is also developing the 802.16m standard to address the IMT-Advanced requirements.

Licensing
bodies of governments around the world are making spectrum available for advanced wireless technologies, including 4G, in recognition of growing demand for wireless broadband
services. Currently, Motorola estimates that there are over 1,700 license holders worldwide for broadband wireless access technologies. The WiMAX market, which now totals over 500 WiMAX networks in
147 different countries, has experienced strong growth since commercial deployments began. While WiMAX has been the early leader in broadband access deployments, LTE has widespread industry support,
not only from current GSM and UMTS operators, but also from CDMA/EV-DO based carriers.

Demand
for our products depends primarily on capital spending by providers of cellular and broadband services for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems, as
well as the marketing of advanced communications services by those providers. The amount of spending by these providers, and therefore a majority of our sales and profitability, are affected by a
variety of factors, including: (i) the continuing trend of consolidation within the cable, wireline and wireless industries, (ii) the financial condition of operators and alternative
providers, including their access to financing, (iii) technology advancements, (iv) standardization efforts that impact the deployment of new technology, (v) new legislation and
regulations affecting the equipment sold by the segment, and (vi) general economic conditions.

During
2009, wireless operators' expenditures globally for 2G GSM and CDMA technology and related services declined compared to 2008. Similar expenditures for iDEN technology were also
down in 2009. Global expenditures for 3G technology and related services, such as W-CDMA/HPSA and CDMA2000/1xEV-DO technology, were up compared to 2008. The continued expansion
of broadband access networks also drove global growth in 2009 for next-generation technologies, such as WiMAX, and related services. Overall wireless infrastructure spending was down
slightly in 2009 compared to 2008. Forecasted industry trends point to a slight increase in operator expenditures globally in 2010, as growth in wireless data access demand drives networks expansion.



Our Strategy

The Home and Networks Mobility segment is focused on leadership in next-generation broadband solutions to accelerate the
delivery of personal media experiences. Key
elements in the segment's strategy include: (i) providing for seamless convergence of services and applications across delivery platforms within the home and across wireline and wireless
networks; (ii) innovating and optimizing our end-to-end network portfolio; and (iii) developing new services that leverage our platforms to provide revenue
generating applications and services to our operator customers while enabling consumers to experience media mobility. As part of our strategy, we have made and will continue to make strategic
acquisitions.

In
the home business, we are focused on accelerating the rate of digital penetration by broadband operators in North America through an enhanced suite of digital entertainment devices.
These products include basic models supporting the industry movement to all-digital delivery and advanced units supporting HD/DVR functions, as well as convergence of IP Media content in
the home. We continue to invest to differentiate our products and services in areas of software and applications, content on-demand and targeted advertising.

We
are capitalizing on telecom operators' decisions to offer IPTV to their subscribers globally, with products that support delivery of video content using both copper-outside-plant and
fiber-to-the-premises ("FTTP") networks. The segment continues to provide video infrastructure, FTTP access network equipment, advanced digital entertainment
devices and IP interactive set-tops to leading telecommunication companies around the world. During 2009, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire BitBand, a leading provider of content
management and delivery systems specializing in video-on-demand for IPTV. We are also an industry leader in broadband data and voice products. We are delivering DOCSIS 3.0 channel bonding on our cable
modem termination systems ("CMTS") and cable modems, and deploying our Gigabit PON platform and Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line ("VDSL") gateways.

In
the networks business, the segment provides equipment and services to over 135 GSM, CDMA and iDEN networks globally. The segment is investing to be a leader in
next-generation wireless broadband technologies with its WiMAX and LTE systems. WiMAX and LTE are evolved wireless broadband technologies that enable operators to provide improved data
performance at lower operating cost. These technologies offer similar advantages for existing operators and emerging broadband service providers and vary in selection depending on the desired
application and available spectrum. In 2009, the segment delivered WiMAX network equipment to 39 WiMAX networks throughout the world. In addition, at the end of 2009, the segment was participating in
12 WiMAX trials globally, representing new business opportunities in 2010. As a leader in the baseline OFDM technology used for WiMAX, the segment is leveraging this expertise to accelerate our LTE
product offering, which will support both frequency division duplex ("FDD") and time division duplex ("TDD") modes. The LTE standard was ratified in December 2008, enabling operators and vendors to
accelerate testing and deployment. The segment is participating in the LTE system architecture evolution trial initiative.

Customers

In 2009, aggregate net sales to the segment's five largest customers, primarily large cable operators and telecommunication companies
located throughout the world, represented approximately 45% of the segment's net sales. The loss of any of the segment's large customers could have a material adverse effect on the segment's business.
Further, because many of the segment's contracts are long-term, the loss of a major customer could impact revenue and earnings over several quarters. The segment's proportion of sales
outside of North America was 51% in 2009, compared to 50% in 2008.

Competition

The businesses in which the segment operates are highly competitive. The rapid technological changes occurring in each of the markets
in which the segment competes are expected to lead to the entry of many new competitors. Competitive factors in the market for the segment's products and systems include: technology offered; product
and system performance; price; product features; quality; delivery and availability. We believe that we are competitively positioned because of our solid relationships with major communication system
operators worldwide, our technology leadership and our new product development capabilities. Price is a major area of competition and often impacts margins for initial system bids, particularly in
emerging markets. Time-to-market has also been an important competitive factor, especially for new systems and technologies.



In
our home business, we compete worldwide in the market for digital entertainment devices and cable and wireline infrastructure equipment for broadband networks. Our largest competitor
is Cisco. Based on 2009 annual sales, we are the leading provider of digital cable and IPTV set-tops worldwide. Our digital entertainment devices and infrastructure equipment compete with
products from a number of different companies, including: (i) those that develop and sell products that are distributed by direct broadcast satellite service providers through retail channels;
(ii) those that develop, manufacture and sell products of their own design; and (iii) those that license technology from us or other competitors.

Traditionally,
cable service providers leased set-tops to their customers with an integrated conditional access content security system. In 2007, FCC regulations requiring
the separation of security functionality from set-tops became effective. In meeting this requirement, we provide security modules to cable operators for use with both our own and
third-party set-tops, as well as in consumer products designed to accept them. The initial implementation limited consumer products to broadcast-delivered channels including premium
services. Several major cable operators are working to support full two-way security interface architecture that allows retail customers access to all programming available on the
operator's network without the need for a set-top box. A few television and video device manufacturers have begun shipping or are developing such devices. If they achieve a meaningful
volume of sales they could negatively impact our sales of set-tops to cable providers.

We
also compete worldwide in the market for broadband data and voice products. We believe that we are a leading provider of cable modems worldwide, competing with several consumer
electronic companies and original design manufacturers worldwide. Our largest competitors for cable and telco broadband data and voice devices include Technicolor (formerly Thomson), Huawei and Arris.

In
the wireless networks market, there is widespread competition from numerous competitors, ranging from some of the world's largest diversified companies to foreign telecommunications
equipment vendors to many small, specialized firms. Ericsson is the market leader, followed by the Nokia-Siemens joint venture, followed by
Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and Motorola, along with other vendors with similar market share. We believe we are a leading provider of WiMAX technologies.

The
segment's networks business is confronting several factors that could impact its business, including, continuing consolidation among competitor telecommunications equipment
providers, consolidation among customers, the potential impact of global economic conditions, and vendor financing by competitors as customers continue to look to vendors as an additional source of
financing.

Payment Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement. In North America, payment is generally due 30 to 60 days from the
invoice date. In regions outside of North America, terms vary widely but are typically limited to no more than 90 days. Contracts for wireless networks typically include implementation
milestones, such as delivery, installation and system acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on the completion of the milestone.

As
required for competitive reasons, extended payment terms are provided to customers from time-to-time on a limited basis. The segment's payment terms are
consistent with industry practice, as many of our contracts are awarded through a competitive bid process. When required for competitive reasons, we may provide long-term financing in
connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase price.

Regulatory Matters

Many of our products are subject to regulation by the FCC in the United States and other communications regulatory agencies around the
world. In addition, our customers, and their networks into which our products are incorporated, are subject to government regulation. Government regulatory policies affecting either the willingness or
the ability of cable and telecom operators, wireless operators and wireline operators to offer certain services, or the terms on which these operators offer the services and conduct their business,
may have a material adverse effect on the segment's results. Motorola has developed products using trunking and data communications technologies to enhance spectral efficiencies. The growth and
results of the wireless communications industry may be affected by regulations impacting access to allocated spectrum for wireless communications users, especially in urban areas where the spectrum is
heavily used.



The
FCC continues to examine ways to promote commercial availability of retail video CPE devices that can deliver Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) content to consumers.
While the FCC has not formally proposed any new regulatory mandates in this area, changes to the existing framework could impact our set-top box business.

The
U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other
technologies. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

As
more fully described under "Enterprise Mobility Solutions—Regulatory Matters," as television transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to more
efficient digital modes, various countries around the world are examining, and in some cases already pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television spectrum. Certain segments of the
spectrum that have historically been utilized for analog television have now been designated to support new commercial communications systems and, therefore, are expected to generate new business
opportunities for Motorola in wireless and video technologies. In the U.S., the FCC conducted an auction of spectrum for the 700 MHz band reclaimed by the government in June 2009. License for
this spectrum may be used for flexible fixed, mobile and broadcast applications. Although the auction winners will determine the best utilization of the acquired spectrum, both LTE and WiMAX are
candidates for technology selection. In addition, a contiguous portion of this spectrum has generated interest for mobile TV applications.

Backlog

The segment's backlog was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2008.
The 2009 order backlog is believed to be generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2010. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is
subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment's operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its
products, systems, technologies and manufacturing processes.

The
segment seeks to build upon our core enabling technologies, such as digital compression, encryption and conditional access systems, and wireless air-interface technology
in order to lead worldwide growth in the market for wired and wireless communications networks. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign
patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on our proprietary knowledge and
ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position and will periodically seek to include our proprietary technologies in certain patent pools that support the
implementation of standards. We are a founder of MPEG LA, the patent licensing authority established to foster broad deployment of MPEG-2-compliant systems, and we have
recently joined the MPEG4-Visual patent pool as a licensor. In addition, we have licensed our digital conditional access technology, DigiCipher® II, to other equipment
suppliers and continue our joint ventures with Comcast for development and licensing of conditional access technology.

We
also enter into other license agreements, both as licensor and licensee, covering certain products and processes with various companies. These license agreements require the payment
of certain royalties that are not expected to be material to the segment's financial results. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales
volumes of the products subject to licenses. The protection of these licenses is also important to the segment's operations. For additional information relating to patents, trademarks and research and
development activities with respect to this segment, see the discussion under "Other Information".

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment's practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a manner
consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2009, the segment had lower inventory balances than at the end of 2008, primarily due to lower sales levels as well as manufacturing strategies to
reduce inventory levels.



Availability
of materials and components required by the segment is relatively dependable, however, fluctuations in supply and market demand could cause selective shortages and affect
results. We currently procure certain materials and components from single-source vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and adversely
impact the segment's financial results.

Natural
gas, electricity, and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy required for our manufacturing operations. Each of these resources are currently in generally
adequate supply for the segment's operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices, which steadily increased during 2009 and impacted our
manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the segment's manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned resources
or a significant cost increase could affect the segment's results.

Generally,
we do not permit customers to return products, other than under standard warranty provisions. The segment has not experienced seasonal buying patterns for its products.

Our Facilities/Manufacturing

The segment's headquarters are located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. Our other major facilities are located in: Arlington Heights,
Illinois; San Diego, California; Taipei, Taiwan; Bangalore, India; Beijing, Hangzhou and Tianjin, China; and Reynosa, Mexico.

A
portion of the segment's manufacturing is done by a small number of non-affiliated electronics manufacturing suppliers and original design manufacturers, primarily in Asia.
The segment relies on these third-party manufacturers in order to enhance its ability to lower costs and/or deliver products that meet consumer demands.

Enterprise Mobility Solutions Segment

The Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment ("Enterprise Mobility Solutions" or the "segment") designs, manufactures, sells, installs and
services analog and digital two-way radios, wireless LAN and security products, voice and data communications products and systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and end-to-end
enterprise mobility solutions to a wide range of customers, including government and public safety agencies (which, together with all sales to distributors of two-way communication products, are
referred to as the "government and public safety market"), as well as retail, energy and utilities, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare and other commercial customers (which, collectively, are
referred to as the "commercial enterprise market"). In 2009, the segment's net sales represented 32% of the Company's consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

We are the world's leading provider of advanced mission-critical and commercial enterprise mobility networks, services, applications
and devices. We offer an extensive portfolio of standard products and services that meet evolving public safety and security needs, including products based on both TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio)
and APCO 25 (Association for Public Safety Communications Officials) standards. The segment also provides products and systems for the advanced exchange of information at the point of business
activity. Our products include two-way radio systems and devices, mobile computing products, advanced data capture products including barcode scanners and imagers, radio frequency
identification ("RFID") infrastructure, software management, security tools and wireless infrastructure.

Our
products and services are sold stand-alone or as an integrated solution through Motorola's direct sales force and through independent and authorized distributors, dealers and
value-added resellers, independent software vendors, original equipment manufacturers and service operators. Distributors and value-added resellers may
provide a service or add components in order to resell our product to end users. Our segment provides systems engineering, installation and other technical and systems management services to meet our
customers' particular needs. The customer may also choose to install and maintain the equipment with its own employees, or may obtain installation, service and parts from a network of the segment's
authorized service centers or from other non-Motorola service centers.



Our Industry

We compete in the mobile segment of the communications industry, providing wireless products and services to government, public safety
and enterprise customers.

For
customers within our government and public safety market, interoperability and natural disaster preparedness continue to be important issues worldwide. Our extensive portfolio of
products includes integration services, equipment and support packages for both of the major standards-based private network technologies, APCO 25 and TETRA, as well as wireless broadband
applications. In 2010 and beyond, as new and better spectrum utilization evolves, we expect to see more demand and greater potential for broadband solutions and data applications, such as video
surveillance and other data-based products. While mission-critical communications and homeland security remain high priorities for our customers, we have seen reduced spending in a number
of industries within the government and public safety market, due to the difficult global economic conditions. We expect this spending reduction to continue in 2010.

We
believe that long-term growth opportunities exist within our commercial enterprise market as the global workforce continues to become more mobile and the industries and
markets that purchase our products continue to expand. Our product and service portfolios within the commercial enterprise market include: mobile computing products, enterprise wireless
infrastructure, bar code scanning, RFID products, and mobile network management platforms. Organizations looking to increase productivity and derive benefits from mobilizing their applications and
workforces are driving adoption in these markets.

Our Strategy

The segment's strategy is to maintain our global leadership positions in the markets we serve through the continued delivery of mobile
products, services and systems that meet our customers' demand for real-time information everywhere.

Our
strategy for our government and public safety market is to enable customers to focus on their missions, not the technology. This is accomplished by providing technology that is
"second nature", including: mission-critical systems, seamless connectivity through highly reliable voice and data networks, and a suite of advanced applications that provide real-time
information to end users. Key objectives in maintaining our leadership position include: (i) continuing investment in our analog radio portfolio while leading the ongoing migration to digital
products; (ii) leveraging our wireless broadband portfolio to drive growth and enter new markets; (iii) managing the potential public/private convergence of 700MHz public safety systems
in the U.S. and digital dividend spectrum worldwide; and (iv) continuing to lead the market in APCO 25 and TETRA standards-based voice and data networking systems around the world. We
continue to actively manage our portfolio, investing to expand into attractive, complementary markets, and divesting non-strategic businesses.

Our
strategy for customers in our commercial enterprise market is to deliver products and services that empower the mobile workforce and transform the enterprise by increasing
productivity, driving cost effectiveness, and promoting faster execution of critical business processes. Our solutions architecture focuses on three areas: (i) a portfolio of devices and
applications that provide real-time information at the point of business activity; (ii) enterprise wireless networks that deliver seamless connectivity inside and outside the four
walls of an enterprise; and (iii) a broad portfolio of management, security and mobility tools, products and applications that transform the enterprise by empowering users closest to the point
of business impact to make decisions.

Customers

Our sales model emphasizes both direct sales by our in-house sales force and indirect sales through our channel of
value-added resellers and distributors. We believe this dual sales approach allows us to meet customer needs effectively, build strong, lasting relationships and broaden our penetration across various
markets. Resellers and distributors each have their own sales organizations which complement and extend our sales organization. With deep expertise about specific customers' operations, resellers are
very effective in promoting sales of the Company's products. Our independent software vendor and value-added resale channels offer customized applications that meet specific needs in each market
segment we serve.

Our
largest customer is the U.S. Government (through its various branches and agencies, including the armed services), which represented approximately 8% of the segment's net sales in
2009. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on the segment's revenue and earnings over several quarters, because some of our contracts with the U.S. Government are
long-term. Net sales to customers in North America represented 58% of the segment's net sales in 2009.



A
majority of our sales are made directly by our in-house sales force, and the remainder of our sales are made through global resellers and distributors. While many
industries we serve have shown little to no growth, or may have even contracted, during 2009, there remains a large number of businesses and consumers globally who have yet to experience the benefits
of converged wireless communications, mobility and the Internet. As the worldwide economies, financial markets and business conditions improve, the Company will have new opportunities to extend our
brand, to market our products and services and to pursue profitable growth.

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Continued evolution in our industry and technological migration is opening up
the market to increased competition. Key competitive factors include: technology offered; price; availability of vendor financing; product and system performance; product features, quality,
availability and warranty; the quality and availability of service; company reputation; relationship with key customers; and time-to-market. We believe we are uniquely
positioned in the industry due to our strong customer relationships, our technological leadership and capabilities and our comprehensive range of offerings.

We
experience widespread competition from a growing number of new and existing competitors, including: large system integrators, manufacturers of mobile computing devices and
manufacturers of products in bar code reading equipment and wireless networks. The segment provides communications and information systems compliant with both APCO 25 and TETRA industry digital
standards. Major competitors include: Harris, EADS, Kenwood, EF Johnson, Intermec, Honeywell and Cisco.

Large
system integrators are seeking to move further into the federal government market. The Company and competitors in this segment may also serve as subcontractors to large system
integrators and are selected based on a number of competitive factors and customer requirements. Where favorable to the Company, we may partner with large system integrators to make available our
portfolio of advanced mission-critical services, applications and devices.

Several
other competitive factors may have an impact on our segment, including: the consolidation among telecommunications equipment providers; evolving developments in the 700 MHz band;
increasing encroachment by broadband and IP solution providers; and new low-tier entrants. Numerous companies, including present manufacturers of scanners, lasers, optical instruments,
microprocessors, wireless networks,
notebook computers, handheld devices and telephonic and other communication devices may have the technical potential to compete with our business. As demand for fully-integrated voice, data, and
broadband systems continues, the segment may face additional competition from public telecommunications carriers.

Payment Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement. Generally, contract payment terms range from 30 to 45 days from the
invoice date within North America and are typically limited to 90 days in regions outside of North America. A portion of the contracts within our government and public safety market include
implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation and system acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on completion of the
milestone.

We
generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required for competitive reasons, we may provide long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases. Financing
may cover all or a portion of the purchase price.

Regulatory Matters

The use of wireless voice, data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum, which is regulated by governmental agencies
throughout the world. In the U.S., the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ("NTIA") regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities,
respectively. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and
international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union ("ITU"). Consequently, the business and results of this segment could be affected by the rules and regulations adopted by
the FCC, NTIA or regulatory agencies in other countries from time to time. The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum
bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.



The
segment manufactures and markets products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. These include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios and portable or
handheld units. Our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum. In addition, new spectrum bands and modified regulations provide possible opportunities for new business.

As
television transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries around the world are examining, and in some cases already
pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television spectrum. In the U.S., pursuant to federal legislation, analog television stations ceased operation in the broadcast television spectrum on
June 12, 2009. As a result of this transition, 108 MHz of spectrum historically used for broadcast television is being redeveloped and deployed for new uses (the so-called "digital
dividend" spectrum), including broadband and narrowband wireless communications. This spectrum can provide new opportunities for Motorola and for our competitors. Under rules adopted by the FCC, this
portion of the spectrum (the 700 MHz band) will support new commercial and public safety communications systems. Licenses for the majority of this spectrum have already been issued. Prior to the end
of the transition from analog to digital television on June 12, 2009, over 40 public safety customers were already implementing narrowband 700 MHz systems in areas where television incumbency
was not an issue. Additional agencies are planning for deployment of systems now that broadcast television is cleared from the 700 MHz band. The FCC is also making provisions for a 700 MHz band
nationwide public safety broadband network that may be built over the next 10-15 years. Public safety organizations have endorsed the use of Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology, a
technology in which Motorola is investing, for this broadband network. Canada also released a consultation requesting industry input on making additional spectrum available for public safety use in
the 700 MHz band and decisions are expected to be released during 2010.

In
addition to reallocating TV spectrum at 700 MHz for public safety and commercial use, in April 2009 the FCC initiated an inquiry on developing a national broadband plan. The FCC
indicated that this inquiry's focus is "to enable the build-out and utilization of high-speed broadband infrastructure." Over the remainder of 2009, the FCC released a series
of requests for input regarding various aspects of broadband across multiple markets including healthcare, education, public safety and consumers. The FCC is required to provide a report to Congress
on its findings during 2010. In addition, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) which includes federal funding for broadband deployment and Smart Grid deployment. These
initiatives to increase the availability of broadband and to support Smart Grid deployment may provide new business opportunities.

Internationally,
the ITU World Radio Conference held in Geneva in November 2007 identified spectrum that could be made available as part of a "digital dividend" as television transitions
from analog to digital technology globally. Countries around the world are studying the potential size, timing and use of this potentially available spectrum. During 2009, the European Commission
issued a mandate to the pan-European regulatory body CEPT asking for the best way to utilize the digital dividend spectrum, which in Europe is located at
790 - 862 MHz. The CEPT provided a preferred bandplan for this digital dividend spectrum. The European Commission is now preparing a spectrum decision expected to be
offered to the European Parliament for adoption. If adopted, the decision would be legally binding on the 27 member states of the European Union, providing a harmonized plan in that area and potential
opportunities for new commercial mobile broadband services and equipment sales going forward. A number of other countries around the world have also indicated their intention to pursue the
availability of digital dividend spectrum.

Some
of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those
governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Certain of our products are
subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products.

Backlog

The segment's backlog was $2.4 billion at both December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The 2009 order backlog is
believed to be generally firm and approximately 75% of that amount is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2010. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future
events that may cause the amount recognized to change.



Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment's operations. The segment has an extensive U.S. and international portfolio of
patents relating to its products, systems, technologies and manufacturing processes, including recent research developments in scanning, information collection, mission critical two-way
radio communication, network communications and network management. We have also filed additional patent applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as in foreign patent offices.

The
segment licenses some of its patents to third parties and this revenue is not significant. Motorola is also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing
fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses.

We
actively participate in the development of open standards for interoperable, mission-critical digital two-way radio systems. We have published our technology and licensed
patents to signatories of the industry's two primary memorandums of understanding defined by the Telecommunications Industry Association ("TIA"), Project 25, European Telecommunications Standards
Institute ("ETSI"), and TETRA.

Notwithstanding
the expiration of certain patents and the resulting potential for increased competition for some of our products in the future, we believe that our extensive patent
portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we believe we are not dependent upon a single patent or a few patents. Our success depends more upon our proprietary
know-how, innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities. In addition, because of changing technology, our present intention is not to rely primarily on patents or other
intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position. However, the segment continues to litigate against competitors to enforce its intellectual property rights in certain
technologies and is currently involved in several such lawsuits. For additional information relating to patents, trademarks and research and development activities with respect to this segment, see
the discussion under "Other Information".

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment's practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory to meet customers' delivery requirements in a manner consistent with
industry standards. The segment provides custom products which require the stocking of inventories and large varieties of piece parts and replacement parts in order to meet delivery and warranty
requirements. To the extent suppliers' product life cycles are shorter than the segment's, stocking of lifetime buy inventories is required to meet long-term warranty and contractual
requirements. In addition, replacement parts are stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle. At the end of 2009, the segment had a lower inventory balance than at the end of
2008, as the Company implemented several initiatives to efficiently utilize its on-hand inventory.

Availability
of materials and components required by the segment is relatively dependable, however, fluctuations in supply and market demand could cause selective shortages and affect
results. We currently procure certain materials and components from single-source vendors. A material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent as a result of the ongoing global financial crisis, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or
an increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact the segment's financial results.

Natural
gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy for our manufacturing operations. Each of these resources are currently in adequate supply for the
segment's operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices, which steadily increased during 2009 and impacted our manufacturing and
shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the segment's manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned resources or a significant
cost increase could affect the segment's results.

Generally,
the segment's contracts do not include a right of return, other than for standard warranty provisions. For new product introductions, we may enter into milestone contracts
providing that the product could be returned if we do not achieve the milestones. Due to buying patterns in the markets we serve, sales tend to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter.

Our Facilities/Manufacturing

The segment's primary offices are located in Schaumburg, Illinois and Holtsville, New York. Our other major facilities are located in:
Penang, Malaysia; Reynosa, Mexico; Krakow, Poland; Berlin, Germany; and Arad, Israel. A portion of the segment's manufacturing is done by a small number of non-affiliated electronics
manufacturing



suppliers
and distribution and logistics services providers. The segment relies on these third-party providers in order to enhance its ability to lower costs and deliver products that meet consumer
demands.

Other Information

Financial Information About Segments.

The response to this section of Item 1 incorporates by
reference Note 12, "Information by Segment and Geographic Region," of Part II,
Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this document.

Customers.

Motorola has several large customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company. In 2009, aggregate net sales to the
Company's five largest customers represented approximately 29% of the Company's sales. During 2009, approximately 11% of net sales were to one customer, Verizon Communications Inc. (including Verizon
Wireless).

Approximately
2% of Motorola's net sales in 2009 were to various branches and agencies, including the armed services, of the U.S. Government. All contracts with the U.S. Government are
subject to cancellation at the convenience of the Government.

Government
contractors, including Motorola, are routinely subjected to numerous audits and investigations, which may be either civil or criminal in nature. The consequences of these
audits and investigations may include administrative action to suspend business dealings with the contractor and to exclude it from receiving new business. In addition, Motorola, like other
contractors, reviews aspects of its government contracting operations, and, where appropriate, takes corrective actions and makes voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Government. These audits and
investigations could adversely affect Motorola's ability to obtain new business from the U.S. Government.

Backlog.

Motorola's aggregate backlog position for all Motorola segments, as of the end of the last two fiscal years was
approximately as follows:

December 31, 2009

$4.9 billion

December 31, 2008

$5.0 billion

Except as previously discussed in this Item 1, the orders supporting the 2009 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table are believed to be generally firm, and
approximately 90% of the backlog on hand at December 31, 2009 is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2010. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future
events that may cause the amount recognized to change.

Research and Development.

Motorola's business segments participate in very competitive industries with constant changes in
technology. Throughout its history, Motorola has relied, and
continues to rely, primarily on its research and development ("R&D") programs for the development of new products, and on its production engineering capabilities for the improvement of existing
products. Technical data and product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola's business segments on a regular basis. Management believes, looking forward, that Motorola's commitment to R&D
programs should allow each of its segments to remain competitive.

R&D
expenditures relating to new product development or product improvement were $3.2 billion in 2009, compared to $4.1 billion in 2008 and $4.4 billion in 2007. R&D
expenditures decreased 23% in 2009 as compared to 2008, after decreasing 7% in 2008 as compared to 2007. Motorola continues to believe that a strong commitment to research and development is required
to drive long-term growth. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 22,000 professional employees were engaged in such R&D activities.

Patents and Trademarks.

Motorola seeks to obtain patents and trademarks to protect our proprietary position whenever possible
and practical. As of December 31, 2009, Motorola and
its wholly owned subsidiaries owned approximately 9,992 utility and design patents in the U.S. and 13,027 patents in foreign countries. These foreign patents are mostly counterparts of Motorola's U.S.
patents, but a number result from research conducted outside the U.S. and are originally filed in the country of origin. During 2009, Motorola, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries were
granted 587 U.S. utility and design patents. Many of the patents owned by Motorola are used in its operations or licensed for use by others, and Motorola is licensed to use certain patents owned by
others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses.



Motorola
has a large portfolio of trademarks, owned in various countries around the world. These marks are valuable corporate assets. Motorola's increasing focus on marketing products
directly to consumers is reflected in an increasing emphasis on brand equity creation and protection.

Environmental Quality.

During 2009, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into
the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of
the environment, did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of Motorola.

Employees.

At December 31, 2009, there were approximately 53,000 employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries,
compared to 64,000 employees of Motorola
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors
described elsewhere in this report or in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements
contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence.

Our strategy to separate our businesses into two publicly-traded companies may have a negative impact on our business operations, operating results and assets.

In March 2008, the Company announced a strategy to separate into two publicly-traded companies. In February 2010, the Company announced
that it is targeting the first quarter of
2011 for the completion of this separation. There are various uncertainties and risks relating to this proposed separation that could have, and in some cases have had, a negative impact on our
business operations, operating results or assets, including: (i) the distraction of management and disruption of operations; (ii) perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may
result in increased difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees, particularly highly qualified employees; (iii) perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may have a negative
impact on our relationships with our customers, suppliers, vendors and partners and may result in the loss of business opportunities; (iv) the process of completing the separation may be time
consuming and expensive and may result in the loss of business opportunities; and (v) we may not be able to successfully achieve the benefits of any strategic alternative undertaken by us.

The uncertainty of current economic and political conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult and may reduce demand for our products.

Current conditions in the domestic and world economies remain very uncertain. The global financial crisis, U.S. unemployment levels and
ongoing political conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties that have impacted worldwide markets. As a result, it is difficult to estimate
changes in various parts of the world economy, including the markets in which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of demand for our
products, the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures difficult.

We
have manufacturing operations and engineering resources in Israel that could be disrupted as a result of hostilities in the region. We also sell our products and services throughout
the Middle East and demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted by hostilities in this region.

The
potential for future terrorist attacks, increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts and public health issues has created worldwide uncertainties that have
negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, demand for certain of our products.

We face a number of risks related to the financial crisis and severe tightening in the global credit markets that began in late 2008 and continued throughout 2009.

The global financial crisis that affected the banking system and financial markets during late 2008 and throughout 2009 resulted in a
severe tightening in the worldwide credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit and equity markets. This financial crisis has impacted, and could
continue to impact, Motorola's business in a number of ways, including:

•

Potential Deferment or Cancellation of Purchases and Orders by
Customers:

Uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause, and in some cases has caused, consumers,
businesses and governments to defer or cancel purchases in response to tighter credit, decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence. If future demand for our products declines due to
global economic conditions, it will negatively impact our financial results.

•

Customers' Inability to Obtain Financing to Make Purchases from Motorola and/or Maintain Their
Business:

Some of our customers require substantial financing in order to fund their operations and make purchases from Motorola. The
inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and/or meet their payment obligations to us could have, and in some cases has had, a negative impact on
our financial results. In addition, if global economic conditions result in insolvencies for our customers, it will negatively impact our financial results.

•

Increased Requests by Customers for Vendor Financing by
Motorola:

Certain of the Company's customers, particularly, but not limited to, those who purchase large infrastructure systems, request
that their suppliers



provide
financing in connection with equipment purchases. In response to limited availability of financing from banks and other lenders, these types of requests have increased in volume and scope.
Motorola has increased its commitments to provide financing in light of these requests and a continuation of the current tightening in the credit markets could force Motorola to choose between further
increasing its level of vendor financing or potentially losing sales to these customers.

•

Negative Impact from Increased Financial Pressures on Third-Party Dealers, Distributors and
Retailers:

A number of our businesses make sales in certain regions through third-party dealers, distributors and retailers. Although
many of these third parties have significant operations and maintain access to available credit, others are smaller and more likely to be impacted by the significant decrease in available credit that
resulted from the financial crisis. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for important third parties and Motorola is unable to successfully transition
end-customers to purchase our products from other third parties or from us directly, it may cause, and in some cases has caused, a negative impact our financial results.

•

Negative Impact from Increased Financial Pressures on Key
Suppliers:

Our ability to meet customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality
materials, parts and components from our suppliers. Certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained
or insolvent as a result of global economic conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and negatively impact our financial results.
In addition, credit constraints at key suppliers have resulted in accelerated payment of accounts payable by Motorola, impacting our cash flow. If this trend continues, it will negatively impact our
cash flow.

•

Increased Risk of Losses or Impairment Charges Related to Debt Securities and Equity and Other Investments Held by
Motorola:

The current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts
realized in the future on our debt and equity investments, including those held in the Sigma Fund, will differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.

Also,
many of the Company's equity investments are in early-stage technology companies and, therefore, may be particularly subject to substantial price volatility and heightened risk from the
tightening in the credit markets.

•

Increased Risk of Financial Counterparty Failures Could Negatively Impact our Financial
Position:

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on
cash flows. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these derivative financial instruments. In order to minimize this risk, the contracts are
distributed among several leading financial institutions, all of whom presently have investment grade credit ratings. Although the Company has not experienced and does not anticipate nonperformance by
its counterparties, in light of the ongoing threats to financial institutions from global economic conditions, there can be no assurance of performance by the counterparties to these financial
instruments.

•

Returns on Pension and Retirement Plan Assets and Interest Rate Changes Could Affect Our Earnings in Future
Periods:

The funding position of our pension plans is impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity
markets, and the discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations for funding and expense purposes. Although there was some recovery in value during 2009, significant declines in the financial
markets in 2008 negatively impacted the value of the assets in the Company's pension plans. In addition, lower bond yields may reduce our discount rates resulting in increased pension contributions
and expense.

Funding
obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the
long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very
volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution
requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of higher contributions in the future increases.

•

Impact on Ability to Sell Receivables:

The Company sells
accounts receivable and long-term receivables to third parties. Sales are made both on a one-time, non-recourse basis and under committed facilities that involve
contractual commitments from third parties to purchase qualifying receivables up to monetary



limits.
These sales of receivables provide the Company the ability to accelerate cash flow when it is prudent to do so. The ability to sell (or "factor") receivables, particularly under committed
facilities, is often subject to the credit quality of the obligor and the Company's ability to obtain sufficient levels of credit insurance from independent insurance companies. The volume of accounts
receivable sold in 2009 was significantly lower than in prior years, driven by both lower net sales and the Company's strategic decision to reduce accounts receivable sales. In addition, the
availability of committed facilities to sell accounts receivable decreased due to the global financial crisis and related tightening in the credit markets. Although the Company is not currently
capacity
constrained in its ability to sell receivables, it could be limited in its ability to sell receivables in the future, particularly if the creditworthiness of our customers declines.

•

Impact on Ability to Purchase Sufficient Credit
Insurance:

We purchase a large amount of credit insurance to mitigate some of our credit risks. In particular, our ability to sell
receivables, particularly under committed receivables facilities, is often subject to obtaining sufficient levels of credit insurance from independent insurance companies. Accordingly, our ability to
sell certain of our receivables, and therefore our cash flows, could be negatively impacted if we are not able to continue to purchase credit insurance in certain countries and in sufficient
quantities. Although credit insurance remains generally available to the Company, it has become more expensive to obtain and often requires higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no
assurances that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of credit insurance in the necessary locations in the future.

We face a number of risks because the Company's long-term debt rating is rated non-investment grade by one credit rating agency resulting in the
Company being a "split rated credit" and because our short-term debt is rated of F-3/P-3:

Standard and Poor's rates the Company's long-term debt as BB+ (one level below investment grade). Fitch Ratings and Moody's
Investor Service each rate the Company's (i) long-term debt as BBB-/Baa3 (the lowest rating for investment grade debt) and (ii) short-term debt as
F-3/P-3. Since the Company has a non-investment grade rating from one rating agency, it is referred to as a "split rated credit". As a "split rated credit", the
Company's business could be impacted in a number of ways including:

•

Our access to the long-term debt market is more
limited:

Our ability to issue long-term debt may be more limited and the market into which split rated debt is offered can
be very volatile and can be unavailable for periods of time. Although there has been some improvement in the capital markets in the second half of 2009, as a split rated credit, it may be more
difficult for us to quickly issue long-term debt and any debt issued is likely to be more costly. These factors may impact our operating and financial flexibility.

•

Our ability to provide performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds could be
limited:

Commercial contracts with Motorola's customers often require performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety
bonds (collectively, referred to as "Performance Bonds") to be issued on behalf of the Company by banks and insurance companies. As a split rated credit, issuers of these Performance Bonds may be less
likely to provide Performance Bonds on the Company's behalf in the future, unless the Company provides collateral, and the costs for issuance may be higher. These limitations on issuance may apply to
the renewal and extension of existing Performance Bonds, as well as the issuance of new Performance Bonds. Such collateral requirements could result in less liquidity for other operational needs.

•

Our ability to hedge foreign exchange risk could be
limited:

Counterparties may be unwilling to provide trading and derivative lines for the Company without cash collateral. This would
limit our ability to reduce volatility in earnings and cash flow. Should cash collateral be provided, less liquidity would be available for operational needs and financial flexibility would be
reduced.

•

Our ability to fund our foreign affiliates could be
limited:

The Company relies on uncommitted lines of credit from banks to provide daylight overdraft, short-term loans and
other sources of liquidity for foreign affiliates. As a split rated credit, lenders may be unwilling to provide credit to our foreign affiliates. This could result in the Company using U.S. cash to
make loans to these affiliates or provide permanent equity where loans are not possible. If this occurs, less liquidity would be available for other operational needs and financial flexibility would
be reduced.

•

Trade terms with suppliers could become less
favorable:

Given the Company's split rating, suppliers may require letters of credit, cash collateral or other forms of security as part
of standard payment conditions. Such requests could result in reduced liquidity and less leverage in pricing negotiations.



•

Our ability to sell receivables could be impacted:

The
conditions placed on us by the parties that we sell our receivables to may become more stringent. If we are unable, or choose not to, meet these new conditions, our ability to sell the receivables
will be negatively impacted. Although in 2009 Motorola made a strategic decision to reduce accounts receivable sales and, therefore, has not been capacity constrained in receivable sales, if the
Company elects to return to historic levels of receivable sales its ability to do so may be limited.

•

Our access to short-term borrowing in the commercial paper market is very
limited:

While the Company has not issued commercial paper since 2007 and does currently view the commercial paper markets as a source
of liquidity, if the Company needs access to very short-term borrowing, it may no longer be able to access the unsecured commercial paper market because of its
F-3/P-3 short-term ratings. Other sources of short-term borrowing may be more limited, if available at all, and will have higher cost to borrow than the
commercial paper market.

The Company's ability to borrow funds under its credit agreement could be constrained by the level of eligible domestic receivables and inventory.

As amended in June 2009, availability under the Company's existing domestic syndicated revolving credit facility is the lesser
of: (i) $1.5 billion, or (ii) an amount determined based on eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory. If the value of eligible accounts receivable and inventory were to
decrease, the amount available under the facility would decrease.

We operate in highly competitive markets and our financial results will be affected if we are not able to compete effectively.

The markets for our products are highly competitive with respect to, among other factors: pricing, product features, product and
service quality, and the time required to introduce new products and services. We are constantly exposed to the risk that our competitors may implement new technologies before we do, or may offer
lower prices, additional products or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer. We can give no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future
competitors.

Our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new products and technologies and our results can be impacted by the effectiveness of our significant investments
in new products and technologies.

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, short product life
cycles and evolving industry standards. We face intense competition in these markets from both established companies and new entrants. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive
to develop and bring to market. Our success depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry
standards and to address competing technological and product developments carried out by our competitors. The research and development of new, technologically-advanced products is a complex and
uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends. We may focus our resources on technologies that do not
become widely accepted or are not commercially viable. In addition, our products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment. If our products are not competitive or do not
work properly, our business will suffer.

Our
results are subject to risks related to our significant investment in developing and introducing new products, such as: advanced wireless handsets, including smartphones; WiMAX, LTE
and other advanced technologies for wireless broadband networks; products for transmission of telephony and high-speed data over hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems; integrated digital
radios; and integrated public safety systems. These risks include: (i) difficulties and delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of products; (ii) customer acceptance
of products; (iii) the development of, approval of, and compliance with industry standards; (iv) the significant amount of resources we must devote to the development of new
technologies; and (v) the ability to differentiate our products and compete with other companies in the same markets.

We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such actions on our business may be limited
by a variety of factors. The cost-reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional production risk and have a negative impact on our sales, profitability and ability to attract and
retain employees.

We have been reducing costs and simplifying our product portfolios in all of our businesses, with sizable reductions in our Mobile
Devices business. We have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated



manufacturing
operations, increased manufacturing with third parties, reduced our employee population and changed our compensation and benefit programs.

The
impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our ability to
successfully complete these ongoing efforts; (ii) our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete; (iii) delays in
implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly-regulated locations outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia; (iv) decline in employee morale and the potential
inability to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees; (v) our ability to retain or recruit key employees, particularly as a result of the suspension of the Company's 401(k)
contributions to employee accounts, the permanent freeze of all future benefit accruals under U.S. pension plans and the elimination of merit increase programs in the U.S. and many other markets;
(vi) the adequacy of our manufacturing capacity, including capacity provided by third parties; and (vii) the performance of other parties under contract manufacturing arrangements on
which we rely for the manufacture of certain products, parts and components.

All
of our businesses have consolidated or exited certain facilities and our products are manufactured in fewer facilities than in the past. While we have business continuity and risk
management plans in place in case capacity is significantly reduced or eliminated at a given facility, the reduced number of alternative facilities could cause the duration of any manufacturing
disruption to be longer. As a result, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits could decline.

The demand for our products depends, in part, on the continued growth of the industries in which we participate. A market decline in any one of these industries could have a
negative impact on our business.

The growth rate in the portions of the telecommunications industry in which we participate is critical to our ability to improve our
overall financial performance and we could be negatively impacted by a slowdown. Our business was very negatively impacted by the continuing economic slowdown and the corresponding reduction in
capital spending by the telecommunications industry in 2008 and 2009.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and, as a result, we face risks that other companies that are not global may not face.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and more than half of our net sales are made to customers outside the U.S.
In addition, we have many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the U.S. and more than half of our employees are employed outside the U.S. Most of our suppliers' operations are
outside the U.S. and most of our products are manufactured outside the U.S.

As
with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations outside the U.S., we are exposed to risks that could negatively impact sales or profitability, including but not limited to:
(i) import/export regulations, tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes, customs classifications and certifications, including but not limited to changes in classifications or errors or
omissions related to such classifications and certifications; (ii) changes in U.S. and non-U.S. rules related to trade, environmental, health and safety, technical standards and
consumer protection; (iii) longer payment cycles; (iv) tax issues, such as tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to country and as compared to the U.S., obligations under
tax incentive agreements, and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner; (v) currency fluctuations, particularly in the Chinese renminbi,
Euro, Brazilian real, Taiwan dollar, Japanese yen and Korean won; (vi) foreign exchange regulations, which may limit the Company's ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency;
(vii) challenges in collecting accounts receivable; (viii) cultural and language differences; (ix) employment regulations and local labor conditions; (x) difficulties
protecting IP in foreign countries; (xi) instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;
(xii) natural disasters; (xiii) public health issues or outbreaks; (xiv) changes in laws or regulations that negatively impact benefits being received by the Company; and
(xv) the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements and (xvi) litigation in foreign court systems and foreign administrative proceedings.

Many
of our products that are manufactured outside the U.S. are manufactured in Asia (primarily China) and Latin America (primarily Mexico and Brazil). If manufacturing in these regions
is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the legal system in China is still developing and this and other
legal systems around the world are subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in China could be negatively impacted by changes to, or interpretation of, Chinese law.



We
also have presence in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Russia. We face additional challenges in emerging markets, including creating demand for our products and the negative
impact of changes in the laws, or the interpretation of the laws, in those countries.

We
also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have polices and procedures to comply with these laws, our employees, contractors, representatives and agents may take actions
that violate our policies. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business. Moreover, we face additional risks that our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated
by third party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services, because such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to
oversee their conduct.

Changes in our operations or sales outside the U.S. markets could result in lost benefits in impacted countries and increase our cost of doing business.

The Company has entered into various agreements with non-U.S. governments, agencies or similar organizations under which
the Company receives certain benefits relating to its operations and/or sales in the jurisdiction. If the Company's circumstances change and operations or sales are not at levels originally
anticipated, the Company may be at risk of losing some or all of these benefits and increasing our cost of doing business.

We may not generate sufficient future taxable income, which may require additional deferred tax asset valuation allowances.

If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, or if there are
significant changes in tax laws or in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, the Company could be required to
increase its valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and a negative impact on future operating results.

If the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.

Some of the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used
in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. Often these issues are identified prior to the shipment of the products and may
cause delays in shipping products to customers, or even the cancellation of orders by customers. Sometimes, we discover quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to our customers,
distributors or end-users, requiring us to resolve such issues in a timely manner that is the least disruptive to our customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment
quality issues can have legal and financial ramifications, including: delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future orders, customer-imposed penalties on Motorola for failure to meet
contractual requirements, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and brand name reputation.

In
some cases, if the quality issue affects the product's safety or regulatory compliance, then such a "defective" product may need to be recalled. Depending on the nature of the defect
and the number of products in the field, it could cause the Company to incur substantial recall costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential loss of future orders and the damage to
the Company's goodwill or brand reputation. In addition, the Company may be required, under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for failed performance that might exceed the revenue that the
Company receives from the contracts. Recalls involving regulatory agencies could also result in fines and additional costs. Finally, recalls could result in third-party litigation, including class
action litigation by persons alleging common harm resulting from the purchase of the products.

If the volume of our sales decrease or do not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs that may make our products less competitive.

We have negotiated favorable pricing terms with many of our suppliers, some of which have volume-based pricing. In the case of
volume-based pricing arrangements, we may experience higher than anticipated costs if current volume-based purchase projections are not met. Some contracts have minimum purchase commitments and we may
incur large financial penalties if these commitments are not met. We also may have unused production capacity if our current volume projections are not met, increasing our production cost per unit. In
the



future,
as we establish new pricing terms, our volume demand could negatively impact future pricing from suppliers. All of these outcomes may result in our products being more costly to manufacture
and less competitive.

Industry convergence between telecom, data and media presents opportunities for our business, but also presents risks.

We are affected by market conditions within the telecommunications, cable and broadband industries. We are also affected by the
convergence of the telecom, data and media industries, which is largely driven by technological development related to IP-based communications. This change impacts our addressable market, competition
and our objective setting and strategies, as well as the need to consider risks to achieve our set objectives. Should we not succeed in understanding the market development or acquiring the necessary
competence to develop and market products and solutions that are competitive in this changing market, our business would be negatively impacted.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components to meet the demands of our customers.

Our ability to meet customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials,
parts and components from our suppliers. We have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of
shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may
not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our businesses.

The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS could impact our financial results.

We are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We
regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from
these continuing examinations will not have a negative impact on future operating results.

Many of our components and products are designed or manufactured by third parties and if third-party manufacturers lack sufficient quality control or if there are
significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third-party manufacturers, it may have a negative impact on our business.

We rely on third-party suppliers for many of the components used in our products and we rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products. If we are not able to engage such manufacturers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such third parties lack
sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third parties, it could have a negative impact on our business.

We
also have third-party arrangements for the design or manufacture of certain products, parts and components. If we are not able to engage such parties with the capabilities or
capacities required by our business, or if these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders
and our sales and profits could decline.

We may be required to record additional goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in an additional significant charge to earnings.

Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be
recoverable include a decline in the Company's stock price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. No goodwill or long-lived assets
impairment charges were recorded during 2009. During 2008, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1.6 billion and intangible asset impairment charges of $136 million. The
goodwill impairment charges resulted from lower asset values in the overall market and the impact of the macroenvironment on the Company's near-term forecasts. The intangible asset
impairments resulted from a change in a technology platform strategy. Further declines in the Company's stock price or reductions in the Company's future cash flow estimates and future operating
results



may
require the Company to record significant additional goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges in our financial statements in future periods, which could negatively impact our
financial results.

Failure of our suppliers to use acceptable ethical business practices could negatively impact our business.

It is our policy to require our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working
conditions, employment practices, environmental compliance and trademark and copyright licensing. However, we do not control their labor and other business practices. If one of our suppliers violates
labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled,
relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. If one of our suppliers fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights or patents, legal action could be
taken against us that could impact the salability of our inventory and expose us to financial obligations to a third party. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of
operations.

Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not develop as expected, our business may be negatively
impacted.

We currently partner with industry leaders to meet customer product and service requirements and to develop innovative advances in
design and technology. Some of our partnerships allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share the cost of developing next-generation technologies. Other partnerships
allow us to offer more services and features to our customers. If such arrangements do not develop as expected, our business could be negatively impacted.

We rely on third-party distributors, representatives and retailers to sell certain of our products.

In addition to our own sales force, we offer our products through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives and retailers.
Certain of our distributors or representatives may also market other products that compete with our products. The loss, termination or failure of one or more of our distributors or representatives to
effectively promote our products, or changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors, representatives or retailers, could affect our ability to bring products to market.

We face many risks relating to intellectual property rights.

Our business will be harmed if: (i) we, our customers and/or our suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property
rights of third parties, (ii) the intellectual property indemnities in our supplier agreements are inadequate to cover damages and losses due to infringement of third-party intellectual
property rights by supplier products, (iii) we are required to provide broad intellectual property indemnities to our customers, (iv) our intellectual property protection is inadequate
to protect our proprietary rights, or (v) our competitors negotiate significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property. We may be harmed if we are forced to make publicly
available, under the relevant open-source licenses, certain internally developed software-related intellectual property as a result of either our use of open-source software
code or the use of third-party software that contains open-source code.

Because
our products are comprised of complex technology, much of which we acquire from suppliers through the purchase of components or licensing of software, we are often involved in or
impacted by assertions, including both requests for licenses and litigation, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, and in the future may assert,
intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our customers and suppliers. These assertions against Motorola, and its customers and suppliers have been increasing as the complexity
of our products have increased. Many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principle business model is to secure patent licensing-based revenue from product
manufacturing companies. The patentees often make broad and sweeping claims regarding the applicability of their patents to Motorola products, seeking a percentage of sales as licenses fees, seeking
injunctions to pressure Motorola into taking a license, or a combination thereof. Defending claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees. Increasingly, third
parties have sought broad injunctive relief which could limit our ability to sell our products in the U.S. or elsewhere with intellectual property subject to the claims. If we do not succeed in any
such litigation, we could be required to expend significant resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual property or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that
is the subject of such litigation, each of which could have a negative impact on Motorola's financial results. However, we cannot be certain that any such licenses, if available at all, will be
available to us on commercially reasonable terms. In some cases, we might be forced to stop delivering certain products if we or our customer or supplier are subject to a final injunction.



We
attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities with our suppliers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. However, there is no assurance that
we will be successful in our negotiations or that a supplier's indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by Motorola and our customers due to the infringing products or that a supplier may
choose to accept a license or modify or replace its products with non-infringing products which would otherwise mitigate such damages and losses. Further, Motorola may not be able to
participate in intellectual property litigation involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any ultimate resolution or outcome that may negatively impact Motorola's sales if a court enters
an injunction that enjoins the supplier's products or if the International Trade Commission issues an exclusionary order that blocks Motorola products from importation into the U.S.

In
addition, our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify them broadly from all damages and losses resulting from intellectual property litigation against them. Because our
customers often derive much larger revenue streams by reselling or leasing our products than we generate from the same products, these indemnity claims by our customers have the potential to expose us
to damages that are much higher than we would be exposed to if we were sued directly.

Our
patent and other intellectual property rights are important competitive tools and may generate income under license agreements. We regard our intellectual property as proprietary and
attempt to protect them with patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and other methods. We also generally restrict access to and distribution of our proprietary
information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective patent,
copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third parties and the cost of any
litigation necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our business.

As
we expand our business, including through acquisitions, and compete with new competitors in new markets, the breadth and strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new
areas may not be as developed as in
our longer-standing businesses. This may expose us to a heightened risk of litigation and other challenges from competitors in these new markets. Further, competitors may be able to negotiate
significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property than we are able to, which puts them at a competitive advantage.

Our future financial results may be negatively impacted if we are not successful in licensing our intellectual property.

As part of the business strategy of some of our business segments, primarily our Mobile Devices business, we generate revenue through
the licensing of intellectual property rights. The licensed rights include those that are essential to telecommunications standards, such as the GSM, 3G and 4G standards. Previously
agreed-upon terms of some of our long-standing license agreements have reduced our royalty revenue over the past several years and are likely to continue to reduce that
revenue. Uncertainty in the legal environment makes it difficult to assure that we will be able to enter into new license agreements that will be sufficient to offset that reduction in our revenue.

Copyright levies in numerous countries for the sale of products may negatively impact our business.

Motorola faces the possibility of substantial copyright levies from collecting societies in numerous countries for the sale of products
that might be used for the private copying of copyright protected works such as mobile phones, memory cards and set top boxes. The collecting societies argue that such levies should apply to such
products because they include audio/video recording functionality, such as an MP3 player or DVR or storage capability, despite the fact that such products are not primarily intended to act as a
recording device. As of this date, to our knowledge, no copyright levies have been paid to any collecting societies anywhere by any manufacturer. Motorola is currently working with other major mobile
communications companies to challenge the applicability of these levies to mobile phones, and is also engaged in aggressive lobbying efforts against the levies in general at the European Union level.
However, if these levies are imposed, our financial results will be negatively impacted.



We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related
to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions.

In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include: (i) the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient
and effective manner; (ii) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions; (iii) the risk that our markets do not evolve as
anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets; (iv) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;
(v) the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations; (vi) the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience; (vii) risks
associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems; (viii) difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the
acquired businesses; and (ix) future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business.

Acquisition
candidates in the industries in which we participate may carry higher relative valuations (based on their earnings) than we do. This is particularly evident in software and
services businesses. Acquiring a business that has a higher valuation than Motorola may be dilutive to our earnings, especially when the acquired business
has little or no revenue. In addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly dilutive to near-term earnings and have, in the past, foregone certain of these acquisitions.

Key
employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change-in-control agreements, acceleration of
stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity- based compensation rights. To retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we may offer additional retention incentives,
but it may still be difficult to retain certain key employees.

The value of our investments in the securities of various companies fluctuates and it may be difficult for us to realize the value of these investments.

We hold a portfolio of investments in various companies. Since the majority of these securities represent investments in technology
companies, the fair market values of these securities are subject to significant price volatility. In addition, the realizable value of these securities is subject to market and other conditions.

We
also have invested in numerous privately-held companies, many of which can still be considered in startup or developmental stages. These investments are inherently risky,
as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose all or substantially all of the value of our
investments in these companies, and in some cases have.

The
Sigma Fund holds U.S. Dollar-denominated debt obligations which include, among other securities, corporate bonds and asset- and mortgage-backed securities. The fair value of these
holdings may experience further declines due to widening credit spreads in several debt market segments or if the underlying debtors should default on their obligations. Such events could result in
additional losses in the Sigma Fund investments.

It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of engineers and other highly-skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive.

Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large
part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly-skilled personnel needed to develop successful new products. We may not be as
successful as our competitors at recruiting, assimilating, retaining and utilizing these highly-skilled personnel. We may have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly-skilled personnel during
periods of poor operating performance. For example, in response to the Company's performance in the last several years, we have temporarily suspended the Company's 401(k) contributions to employee
accounts, permanently froze all future benefit accruals under U.S. pension plans and temporarily suspended merit increase programs in the U.S. and many other markets.

Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, retain and prepare succession plans for senior management and key employees.

The performance of our Co-CEOs, senior management and other key employees is critical to our success. If we are unable to retain
talented, highly qualified senior management and other key employees or attract them when needed, it could negatively impact the Company. We rely on the experience of our senior management, who have
specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and competition for



management
with experience in the technology industry is intense. A loss of a Co-CEO, a member of senior management or key employee particularly to a competitor could also place us at a competitive
disadvantage, Further, if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our Co-CEOs, senior management and other key employees, the Company could be negatively impacted.

The unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation or administrative action could negatively impact the Company.

Our financial results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative
actions, including those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws. See "Item 3—Legal Proceedings." There can be no assurances as to the
favorable outcome of any litigation. In addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation and these costs could negatively impact our financial results.

We are exposed to risks under large multi-year system contracts that may negatively impact our business.

We enter into large multi-year system contracts with large customers. This exposes us to risks, including: (i) the
technological risks of such contracts, especially when the contracts involve new technology, and (ii) financial risks under these contracts, including the estimates inherent in projecting costs
associated with large contracts and the related impact on operating results. We are also facing increasing competition from traditional system integrators and the defense industry as system contracts
become larger and more complicated. Political developments also can impact the nature and timing of these large contracts.

It is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance we are forced to retain the risk.

The Company has many types of insurance coverage and also self-insures for some risks and obligations. The insurance market
was disrupted after the events of September 11, 2001 and the 2005 hurricanes. While the cost and availability of most insurance has stabilized,
there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain unavailable. Natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims and public liability are potential
self-insured events that could negatively impact our financial results.

We are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental laws.

Our operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are subject to a wide range of global laws. Compliance with existing or
future laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and generally impact our financial
performance. Some of these laws relate to the use, disposal, clean up of, and exposure to hazardous substances. In the United States, laws often require parties to fund remedial studies or actions
regardless of fault. Motorola continues to incur disposal costs and has ongoing remediation obligations. Changes to U.S. environmental laws or our discovery of additional obligations under these laws
could have a negative impact on Motorola.

Over
the last several years, laws focused on: the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories; recycling of both electronic products and packaging; reducing or eliminating
certain hazardous substances in electronic products; and the transportation of batteries have expanded significantly. Laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products, standardization
of connectors and power supplies, sound levels of music playing devices, the transportation of lithium-ion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating.

These
laws impact our products and make it more expensive to manufacture and sell products. It may also be difficult to comply with the laws in a timely way and we may not have compliant
products available in the quantities requested by our customers, thereby impacting our sales and profitability. We expect these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate increased demand to meet
voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain hazardous constituents from products, increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional accessibility.

Government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce barriers to entry for new competitors.

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other countries
and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal communications industry may be affected: (i) by regulations relating to the access to
allocated spectrum for wireless communication users, especially in urban areas, (ii) if adequate frequencies are not allocated, or (iii) if new technologies are not developed to better
utilize the frequencies currently allocated for



such
use. Industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by the cost of new licenses required to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The
U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
systems, such as WiFi, mesh technologies and wide area network systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of these
and other technologies. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

Changes in government policies and laws or economic conditions may negatively impact our financial results.

Our results may be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of U.S. and
non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations. Our results may also be affected by social and economic conditions, which impact our operations, including in emerging markets in
Asia, India, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in markets subject to ongoing political hostilities and war, including the Middle East.

In
addition, the laws and regulations that impact access to, content on or commerce conducted on the Internet are still evolving. We could be negatively impacted by any such regulation
in any country where we operate, including under the new presidential administration in the U.S. The adoption of such measures could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the
cost of selling such products.

We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our
operations, sales and operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within
Motorola and some are outsourced. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to computer viruses,
security breach, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are
defective or are not installed properly. We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but a system failure or security breach could negatively
impact our operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.

Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.

Our share price has been volatile due, in part, to generally volatile securities markets, and the volatility in the telecommunications
and technology companies' securities markets in particular. Factors other than our financial results that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to, market expectations of our
performance, spending plans of our customers, and the level of perceived growth in the industries in which we participate.

In our Mobile Devices business specifically:

We have had substantial operating losses in each of the last three years and may continue to incur losses as we continue to reposition our Mobile Devices business.

In each of the last three years, Motorola had substantial operating losses as a result of the financial performance of our Mobile
Devices business. While we have plans in place intended to improve the performance of this business, we cannot be certain that we will be successful or that this business will be profitable in 2010.

The worldwide wireless mobile handset market contracted in 2009 compared to 2008 and further declines in this worldwide market could negatively impact transition plans for
our Mobile Devices business.

In 2009, worldwide wireless handset industry unit shipments declined by approximately 6%. This is the first annual decline in industry
handset unit shipments since 2001. A declining mobile handset market in 2010, particularly if it impacts smartphone sales, may make it more difficult to improve the performance of our Mobile Devices
business.

Our strategy for the Mobile Devices business may be too concentrated on certain products.

The product portfolio in the Mobile Devices business is extensively targeted at the smartphone market, with particular concentration on
smartphones using an Android-based operating system. These products are an important part of the business plan. If such Android-based smartphones do not remain competitive in the marketplace, our
financial performance would suffer and a shift in strategy would be costly and difficult.



We have lost significant market share in our Mobile Devices businesses and such loss has negatively impacted our performance and may continue to negatively impact our
financial results.

Our share of the worldwide wireless handset market has declined significantly in the last several years. While we reduced our costs
during this period of time, our significantly lower sales volume and the resulting market share declines have had a negative impact on our results of operations. Although our primary focus is
profitable growth, if our market share of smartphone shipments does not increase our strategy to return our Mobile Devices business to profitability will be negatively impacted.

Our future financial results may be negatively impacted if we do not execute on our hardware and software strategy for our Mobile Devices business.

As part of our ongoing effort to improve the product portfolio of our Mobile Devices business, we have been rationalizing our hardware
and software platforms to reduce the complexity of our product platforms and system architecture. This allows us to lower our costs to produce devices and to enable richer consumer experiences.
Failure to continue to execute these rationalization plans in a timely and effective manner may cause us to be competitively disadvantaged in many areas, including but not limited to, cost, time to
market and the ability to ramp-up production in a timely fashion with acceptable quality and improved/additional features.

If our operating system strategy is not successful, our Mobile Devices business could be negatively impacted.

We have made a strategic decision to use third-party and/or open source operating systems, such as Google's Android operating system in
our wireless products. As a result of this, we are at risk due to our dependency on third parties' continued development of operating systems and third parties' software application ecosystem
infrastructures. With respect to Google's Android operating system, which is a newer operating system for wireless handsets, in the event that Google's Android team no longer develops the Android code
base and this development is not taken up by the open source community, this would increase the burden of development on Motorola. From an overall risk perspective, the industry is currently engaged
in an extremely competitive phase with respect to operating system platforms and software generally. Android is viewed as a competitive platform in the Linux and smartphone categories. If
(i) Android fails to continue to gain operator and/or developer adoption, or (ii) any updated versions or new releases of Google's Android operating system are not made available to
Motorola in a timely fashion, Motorola could be competitively disadvantaged and the Company's financial results could be negatively impacted.

In our Home and Networks business specifically:

Consolidations in both the cable and telecommunication industries may negatively impact our business.

The cable and telecommunication industries have experienced consolidation and this trend is expected to continue according to industry
estimates. Industry consolidation could result in delays of purchases or in the selection of new suppliers by the merged companies. This could negatively impact equipment suppliers like Motorola and
our competitors. Due to continuing consolidation within the cable and telecommunications industries worldwide, a small number of operators own a majority of cable television systems and account for a
significant portion of the capital spending made by cable telecommunications systems operators.

The effects of FCC regulations requiring separation of security functionality from set-tops could negatively impact our sales of set-tops to cable
providers.

Historically, reception of digital television programming from a cable broadband network required a set-top with security
technology. Traditionally, cable service providers leased their set-top to their customer. This security technology limited the availability of set-tops to those manufactured
by a few cable network manufacturers, including Motorola. In 2007, FCC regulations requiring separation of security functionality from set-tops became effective. Several major cable
operators are working to support full two-way security interface architecture that allows retail customers access to all programming available on a cable operator's network without the
need for a set-top box and a few television and video device manufacturers have begun shipping or are developing such devices. If these manufacturers achieve a meaningful volume of sales
it could negatively impact Motorola's sales of set-tops.

Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments

None.



Item 2: Properties

Motorola's principal executive offices are located at 1303 East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196. Motorola
also operates manufacturing facilities and sales offices in other U.S. locations and in many other countries. (See "Item 1: Business" for information regarding the location of the major
facilities for each of Motorola's business segments.) Motorola owns 22 facilities (manufacturing, sales, service and office), 12 of which are located in the Americas Region (USA, Canada, Mexico,
Central and South America) and 10 of which are located in other countries. Motorola leases 322 facilities, 131 of which are located in the Americas Region and 191 of which are located in other
countries. Motorola primarily utilizes 10 major facilities for the manufacturing and distribution of its products. These facilities are located in: Hangzhou and Tianjin, China; Taipei, Taiwan;
Chennai, India; Penang, Malaysia; Schaumburg, Illinois; Jaguariuna, Brazil; Reynosa, Mexico; Arad, Israel; and Berlin, Germany.

Since
the beginning of 2009, facilities in: Chandler, Arizona; Libertyville, Illinois; Flensburg, Germany; Nogales, Mexico; and Gurgaon, India were sold. Sites in Singapore and Swindon,
England are currently for sale or under contract.

Motorola
generally considers the productive capacity of the plants operated by each of its business segments to be adequate and sufficient for the requirements of each business group.
The extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies from plant to plant and from time to time during the year.

A
substantial portion of Motorola's products are manufactured in Asia, primarily China, either in our own facilities or in the facilities of others who manufacture and assemble products
for Motorola. If manufacturing in the region was disrupted, Motorola's overall productive capacity could be significantly reduced.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Howell v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

A class action,

Howell v. Motorola, Inc., et al.,

was filed against Motorola and
various of its directors, officers and employees in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois ("Illinois District Court") on July 21, 2003, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). The complaint alleged that
the defendants had improperly permitted participants in the Motorola 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") to purchase or hold shares of common stock of Motorola because the price of Motorola's stock was
artificially inflated by a failure to disclose vendor financing to Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. ("Telsim") in connection with the sale of telecommunications equipment by Motorola.
Telsim had subsequently defaulted on the payment of approximately $2 billion of such vendor financing, approximately half of which the Company has recovered to date. The plaintiff sought to
represent a class of participants in the Plan and sought an unspecified amount of damages. On September 30, 2005, the Illinois District Court dismissed the second amended complaint filed on
October 15, 2004 (the "Howell Complaint"). Three new purported lead plaintiffs subsequently intervened in the case, and filed a motion for class certification seeking to represent a class of
Plan participants. The class as certified includes all Plan participants for whose individual accounts the Plan purchased and/or held shares of Motorola common stock from May 16, 2000 through
May 14, 2001, with certain exclusions. The court granted leave to defendants to appeal the class certification and granted leave to lead plaintiff Howell to appeal an earlier dismissal of his
individual claim. Each party filed those appeals. On June 17, 2009, the Illinois District Court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on all counts. On June 25, 2009, the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (the "Seventh Circuit") dismissed as moot defendants' class certification appeal and stayed Howell's appeal. On July 14, 2009, plaintiffs appealed the summary
judgment decision. By order of the Seventh Circuit on August 17, 2009, Howell's individual appeal and plaintiffs' appeal of the summary judgment decision (now cited as

Howell v. Motorola, Inc. et al.

and

Lingis et al. v. Rick Dorazil et al.

) have been consolidated
with

Spano et al. v. Boeing Company et al.

and

Beesley et al. v. International Paper Company

for
argument and decision.

Silverman/Williams Federal Securities Lawsuits and Related Derivative Matters

A purported class action lawsuit on behalf of the purchasers of Motorola securities between July 19, 2006 and January 5,
2007,

Silverman v. Motorola, Inc., et al

., was filed against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors of the Company on
August 9, 2007, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as well as, in the case of the individual defendants, the control person provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. The factual assertions in the complaint consist primarily of
the allegation that the defendants knowingly made incorrect statements concerning Motorola's projected revenues for the third and



fourth
quarter of 2006. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief relating to the purported inflation in the price of Motorola shares during the class period. An amended complaint was
filed December 20, 2007, and Motorola moved to dismiss that complaint in February 2008. On September 24, 2008, the district court granted this motion in part to dismiss
Section 10(b) claims as to two individuals and certain claims related to forward looking statements, among other things, and denied the motion in part. On August 25, 2009, the district
court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification.

In
addition, on August 24, 2007, two lawsuits were filed as purportedly derivative actions on behalf of Motorola,

Williams v. Zander, et
al.

, and

Cinotto v. Zander, et al.

, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against the Company and certain of its
current and former officers and directors. These complaints make similar factual allegations to those made in the

Silverman

complaint and assert causes
of action for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek unspecified damages associated with the alleged loss
to the Company deriving from the defendants' actions and demand that Motorola make a number of changes to its internal procedures. An amended complaint was filed on
December 14, 2007. On January 27, 2009, Motorola's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part.

St. Lucie County Fire District Firefighters' Pension Trust Fund Securities Class Action Case

A purported class action lawsuit on behalf of the purchasers of Motorola securities between December 6, 2007 and
January 22, 2008,

St. Lucie County Fire District Firefighters' Pension Fund v. Motorola, Inc., et al.,

was filed against the
Company and certain current and former officers and directors of the Company on January 21, 2010, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint
alleges violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as, in the case of the individual defendants, the control person provisions
of the Securities Exchange Act. The primary factual assertions in the complaint are that the defendants knowingly or recklessly made materially misleading statements concerning Motorola's financial
projections and sales demand for Motorola phones during the class period. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief relating to the purported inflation in the price of Motorola shares
during the class period.

Groussman v. Motorola et al. and Orlando v. Motorola et al. ERISA Class Action Cases

Two purported class action lawsuits on behalf of all participants in or beneficiaries of the Motorola 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") between
July 1, 2007 and the present and whose accounts included investments in Motorola stock,

Joe M. Groussman v. Motorola, Inc. et al

. and

Angelo W. Orlando v. Motorola,
Inc. et al

., were filed against the Company and certain current and former officers, directors, and employees of
the Company, the Motorola 401(k) Plan Committee, the Advisory Committee of Motorola and other unnamed defendants on February 10, 2010, in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois. The identical complaints allege violations of Sections 404 and 405 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). The primary claims in the complaints
are that, in connection with alleged incorrect statements concerning Motorola's financial projections and demand for Motorola phones during the class period, various of the defendants failed to
prudently and loyally manage the Plan by continuing to offer Motorola stock as a Plan investment option, failed to provide complete and accurate information regarding the performance of Motorola stock
to the Plan's participants and beneficiaries, failed to avoid conflicts of interest, and/or failed to monitor the Plan fiduciaries. The complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief relating to
the purported losses to the Plan and individual participant accounts.

Motorola
is a defendant in various other suits, claims and investigations that arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of the
Company's pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2009. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing under "Item 8:
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Executive Overview

What businesses are we in?

Motorola reports financial results for the following three operating business segments:

•

The

Mobile Devices

segment designs, manufactures, sells and services
wireless handsets, including smartphones, with integrated software and accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. The segment's net sales in 2009 were $7.1 billion, representing
32% of the Company's consolidated net sales.

•

The

Home and Networks Mobility

segment designs, manufactures, sells,
installs and services: (i) digital video, Internet Protocol video and broadcast network interactive set-tops ("digital entertainment devices"), end-to-end
video distribution systems, broadband access infrastructure platforms, and associated data and voice customer premise equipment to cable television and telecom service providers (collectively,
referred to as the "home business"), and (ii) wireless access systems, including cellular infrastructure systems and wireless broadband systems, to wireless service providers (collectively,
referred to as the "network business"). The segment's net sales in 2009 were $8.0 billion, representing 36% of the Company's consolidated net sales.

•

The

Enterprise Mobility Solutions

segment designs, manufactures, sells,
installs and services analog and digital two-way radios, wireless LAN and security products, voice and data communications products and systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and
end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions to a wide range of customers, including government and public safety agencies (which, together with all sales to distributors of two-way communication
products, are referred to as the "government and public safety market"), as well as retail, energy and utilities, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare and other commercial customers (which,
collectively, are referred to as the "commercial enterprise market"). The segment's net sales in 2009 were $7.0 billion, representing 32% of the Company's consolidated net sales.

What were our 2009 financial results?

•

Net Sales were $22.0 Billion:

Our net sales were
$22.0 billion in 2009, down 27% compared to net sales of $30.1 billion in 2008. Net sales decreased 41% in the Mobile Devices segment, decreased 21% in the Home and Networks Mobility
segment and decreased 13% in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment.

•

Operating Loss of $148 Million:

We incurred an
operating loss of $148 million in 2009, compared to an operating loss of $2.4 billion in 2008. The operating loss in 2009 was smaller than in 2008 primarily due to: (i) the
absence in 2009 of a comparable $1.6 billion charge in 2008 related to goodwill impairments, (ii) lower excess inventory and other related charges in 2009 than in 2008, when the charges
included a $370 million charge due to a decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms in the Mobile Devices segment, and (iii) the absence in 2009 of a comparable
$150 million charge in 2008 related to settlement of a purchase commitment.

•

Loss from Continuing Operations of $111 Million, or $0.05 per
Share:

We incurred a loss from continuing operations of $111 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share, in 2009, compared to a
loss from continuing operations of $4.2 billion, or $1.87 per diluted common share, in 2008.

•

2009 Annual Handset Shipments of 55.1 Million Units:

We shipped
55.1 million handsets in 2009, a 45% decrease compared to shipments of 100.1 million handsets in 2008. We shipped 12.0 million handsets in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 38%
decrease compared to shipments of 19.2 million handsets in the fourth quarter of 2008.

•

Digital Entertainment Device Shipments were
14.7 Million:

We shipped 14.7 million digital entertainment devices in 2009, a decrease of 18% compared to shipments of
18.0 million units in 2008.

•

Operating Cash Flow of $629 Million:

We generated
operating cash flow of $629 million in 2009, an increase of 160% compared to operating cash flow of $242 million in 2008. The primary contributors to



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

the
improvement in cash flow from operations in 2009 were: (i) a $1.3 billion decrease in net inventory, (ii) a $960 million decrease in other current assets, and
(iii) income from continuing operations (adjusted for non-cash items) of $892 million, partially offset by a $2.6 billion decrease in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities.

What were the financial results for our three operating business segments in 2009?

•

In Our Mobile Devices Business:

Net sales were
$7.1 billion in 2009, a decrease of 41% compared to net sales of $12.1 billion in 2008. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a 45% decrease in unit shipments, partially
offset by an 8% increase in average selling price ("ASP"). On a product technology basis, net sales decreased substantially for GSM, CDMA and 3G technologies, partially offset by an increase in net
sales for iDEN technology. On a geographic basis, net sales decreased substantially in Latin America, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region ("EMEA") and Asia and, to a lesser extent, decreased in
North America.

The
segment incurred an operating loss of $1.1 billion in 2009, an improvement of 51% compared to an operating loss of $2.2 billion in 2008. The decrease in the operating loss was
primarily due to: (i) lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives,
(ii) lower research and development ("R&D") expenditures, reflecting savings from cost-reduction initiatives, (iii) lower excess inventory and other related charges in 2009
than in 2008, when the charges included a $370 million charge due to a decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms, and (iv) the absence in 2009 of a comparable
$150 million charge in 2008 related to settlement of a purchase commitment, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin, driven by the 41% decrease in net sales.

•

In Our Home and Networks Mobility Business:

Net sales were
$8.0 billion, a decrease of 21% compared to net sales of $10.1 billion in 2008. The decrease in net sales reflects a 22% decrease in net sales in the networks business and a 21% decrease
in net sales in the home business. On a geographic basis, net sales decreased in all regions.

Operating
earnings were $558 million in 2009, a decrease of 39% compared to operating earnings of $918 million in 2008. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease
in gross margin, driven by the 21% decrease in net sales, partially offset by a favorable product mix. Also contributing to the decrease in operating earnings was: (i) a $75 million
charge related to a legal settlement, and (ii) $39 million of charges related to a facility impairment. These factors were partially offset by decreases in both R&D and SG&A expenses,
reflecting savings from cost-reduction initiatives.

•

In Our Enterprise Mobility Solutions Business:

Net sales
were $7.0 billion in 2009, a decrease of 13% compared to net sales of $8.1 billion in 2008. On a geographic basis, net sales decreased in North America, EMEA and Latin America, partially
offset by increased net sales in Asia.

Operating
earnings were $1.1 billion in 2009, a decrease of 29% compared to operating earnings of $1.5 billion in 2008. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease
in gross margin, driven by the 13% decrease in net sales and an unfavorable product mix. Also contributing to the decrease in operating earnings was an increase in reorganization of business charges,
relating primarily to higher employee severance costs. These factors were partially offset by decreased SG&A and R&D expenditures, primarily related to savings from cost-reduction
initiatives.

What were our major challenges and accomplishments in 2009?

•

In Our Mobile Devices Business:

2009 was a year of
significant change in the Mobile Devices business, including transitioning the product portfolio, restructuring the business and implementing operational improvements. From a portfolio perspective,
the Mobile Devices business made significant progress on its 3G smartphone strategy by reducing the number of software platforms across the product portfolio, using Android, a Google-developed,
royalty-free operating system platform for smartphones, and reducing the number of feature phone devices in the portfolio. During this period of change, Mobile Devices increased its focus
in priority markets, including North America and Latin America, and parts of Asia, including China. Demand for Mobile Devices' wireless handsets declined in 2009 primarily due to limited product
offerings in feature phones and smartphones as the Company implemented its strategy to transition its


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


product
portfolio. In 2009, the Company lost market share and was the fifth-largest worldwide supplier of wireless handsets.

During
the year, Mobile Devices reduced its cost structure by over $1.5 billion, including reductions in research and development and selling, general and administrative costs. Reductions were
the result of eliminating product platforms, focusing on key markets and other efficiencies. In addition, operational improvements were made in the supply chain, resulting in improved inventory
management and reduced levels of excess and obsolete inventory.

In
the fourth quarter of 2009, the Mobile Devices business launched CLIQ

TM

/DEXT

TM

with MOTOBLUR

TM

and DROID by Motorola/MILESTONE

TM

, our first
Android-based smartphones. These phones represent the beginning of the transition of our portfolio to smartphones, the fastest growing segment of the handset market. Our new products begin to address
consumer demand for smartphones with higher quality displays, broadband connectivity everywhere, over-the-air update capability, and enhanced mobile experiences enabled by a
multi-tasking, graphical operating system. Consumer reception of our first smartphones was very strong, resulting in shipments of two million Android-based smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2009.

From
a financial perspective, the Mobile Devices segment significantly reduced its operating loss and cash consumption in 2009 compared to 2008. This improvement was due primarily to the reduction in
its cost structure, improvement in operating and supply chain efficiencies, and implementation of its portfolio transition, including the launch of new smartphones.

•

In Our Home and Networks Mobility Business:

The Home and
Networks Mobility business was impacted by a decline in the market for its home business. This was attributable largely to economic conditions in the U.S. which negatively impacted consumer spending
and housing. During 2009, the business remained the world's leading provider of digital entertainment devices and shipped its 100 millionth digital entertainment device, improved its gross
margin percentage, reduced operating expenses, maintained operating profitability and generated cash.

While
market conditions contributed to a decline in sales in the home business compared to 2008, the longer term demand fundamentals for end-to-end video distribution systems,
digital entertainment devices and video network infrastructure remain intact. Continued prioritization of research and development resulted in the business further enhancing its portfolio of advanced
video products. This included the launch of innovative digital entertainment devices, including multi-room DVR products. Portfolio enhancements also included high-performance video servers
and transcoding devices to enable operators to provide more advanced viewing experiences and services. The home business also announced the acquisition of BitBand, a leading provider of content
management and delivery systems, specializing in video-on-demand for IPTV.

As
anticipated, the networks business experienced a decline in sales for all 2G and 3G technologies in 2009 compared to 2008. Motorola continued its investments and leadership in
next-generation wireless broadband technologies, including WiMAX and LTE. In WiMAX, we maintained a leading portfolio of customers around the world and generated over $600 million
in sales, making us the market leader. In LTE, KDDI in Japan selected us for development and implementation of their LTE mobile broadband network and we participated in several LTE trial activities
with leading operators around the world.

•

In Our Enterprise Mobility Solutions Business:

In 2009,
sales in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions business were lower than in 2008. This was primarily due to a decline in demand in certain industries served, resulting from adverse economic conditions.
Enterprise Mobility Solutions maintained its leading global market share position, reduced operating expenses, maintained a high level of operating profitability and generated cash.

Despite
the budget challenges facing many of the U.S. states, demand for our products and solutions by customers in the government and public safety market in the U.S. was relatively consistent with
2008. By leveraging our thought leadership, comprehensive portfolio and strong customer relationships, we maintained market share in the U.S., our largest market. In the latter half of 2009, demand in
the commercial enterprise market, specifically in the retail vertical, for mobile computing and data capture products began to improve. With the benefit of cost reductions implemented in the first
half of 2009 and improving demand trends, we were able to significantly improve the operating profitability of our Enterprise Mobility Solutions business in the second half of the year.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

During
the year, we enhanced our product portfolio with the introduction of several innovative products. With our APX family of products, we are the only manufacturer to offer interoperable mobile and
portable multi-band radios and related infrastructure equipment. We continued our market leadership in TETRA products outside the U.S., and reached an industry leading milestone by
shipping our one millionth TETRA subscriber radio. We also enhanced our leading rugged mobile computing portfolio with the launch of the MC9500, MC3100 and MC55 product lines. In the advanced data
capture portfolio, we announced the MT2000 series of rugged, hand-held bar code scanners that incorporate the benefits of a mobile computer, an industry first. These products have all
received very positive customer response.

Looking Forward

During 2009, challenging economic conditions around the world impacted many of our customers and consumers, resulting
in reduced demand in many of our businesses. In the latter half of 2009, although sales levels in our businesses remained well below 2008 levels, there were signs of stabilization in the markets that
we serve. In 2010, we expect demand to increase in the market for handsets, particularly smartphones, as well as certain markets for the Enterprise Mobility Solutions business. Demand in other
markets, including the markets for the Home and Networks Mobility business, are expected to have little to no growth, or may even contract. As worldwide economic conditions, financial markets and
overall business conditions improve, we will have opportunities to extend our brand, to sell our products and services and to pursue profitable growth.

For
the longer term, we believe the fundamental trends toward convergence of mobility, computing and communications, the need for faster wireless broadband speeds, and evolution of the
mobile Internet will continue. We are focused on designing and delivering innovative wired and wireless communications products and systems, unique mobile experiences and powerful networks, as well as
complementary support services. We believe this positions us to provide customers and consumers with differentiated products and solutions for when, where and how they connect to people, information
and entertainment.

In
our Mobile Devices business, we expect the overall global handset market to remain intensely competitive. We expect an increase in total industry handset demand in 2010 compared to
2009, particularly in smartphones. Our strategy is focused on enhancing our smartphone portfolio, optimizing our cost structure and strengthening our position in priority markets. Our transition to a
more competitive portfolio began in the fourth quarter of 2009 with the introduction of new smartphones based on the Android operating system and MOTOBLUR

TM

, our proprietary applications
and services suite. In 2010, a significant number of our new devices will be smartphones as we expand our portfolio across a broader set of price points and address a wider set of customers. Our
initial market focus includes North America, parts of Asia, including China, and Latin America. Based upon our performance in these markets, we will look to expand our presence in other geographic
regions, including Western Europe. We will continue to deliver a feature phone portfolio, albeit more limited than in the past, by leveraging our ODM partnerships to meet carrier and retail customer
requirements and extend our brand. Overall in 2010, feature phone sales including IDEN, are expected to be lower. We also are continuing our focus on our accessories portfolio to deliver complete
mobile experiences.

Cost-reduction
initiatives implemented in 2009 allowed the Mobile Devices business to enter 2010 with a more competitive cost structure. In 2010, we will further optimize our
cost structure as we reduce our investment in certain areas and reinvest in smartphone innovation, as well as MOTOBLUR. Collectively, these actions are designed to accelerate our speed to market and
to allow us to offer richer consumer experiences, build our brand and improve our financial performance.

In
our Home and Networks Mobility business, we are focused on delivering personalized media experiences to consumers at home and on-the-go and enabling service
providers to operate their networks more efficiently and profitably. Due to economic conditions in the U.S., particularly related to consumer spending and the housing market, demand slowed in 2009 in
the markets served by our home business. While the longer term fundamentals for the home business remain intact, we expect the soft demand environment to continue in the near term. As U.S. economic
conditions improve, and as operators' need for more bandwidth and upgraded infrastructure for the provisioning of advanced services to consumers increases, demand trends for our home business are
expected to improve. We will leverage our market leading position in digital entertainment devices and video delivery systems and prioritize our research and development efforts to ensure that we are
well positioned for growth when demand levels recover.

In
our networks business, we are investing in next-generation wireless broadband technologies, including WiMAX and LTE, while continuing to optimize our 2G and 3G business.
In WiMAX, we are building upon a strong portfolio of customers and leveraging our market leadership. In LTE, we will continue to evolve our competitive radio access network solution (RAN) while
focusing on leading wireless network customers around


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


the
world, including those in the U.S., Japan, China and the Middle East and Africa region. We expect the overall 2G and 3G wireless infrastructure market to decline in 2010 compared to 2009 and to
remain highly competitive.

In
the Home and Networks Mobility segment, we will continue to optimize our overall cost structure while prioritizing investments in next-generation technologies commensurate
with opportunities for profitable growth. This positions the business for future opportunities in emerging technologies, including video and wireline and wireless broadband, and enables the business
to maintain profitability in mature technologies.

In
our Enterprise Mobility Solutions business, we have market leading positions in both mission-critical and business-critical communications solutions for customers around the world. We
continue to develop next-generation products and solutions for customers in our government and public safety and commercial enterprise markets. Many U.S. states and local governments are
facing budget deficits in 2010 and some states may be required to significantly curtail spending. Additionally, many governments outside the U.S. are facing budget deficits. We believe that these
customers will continue to place a high priority on mission-critical communications and homeland security products and solutions. In 2009, while we experienced relatively stable levels of demand from
these customers, continued budget constraints, especially in the U.S. market, could impact the timing and volume of purchases in 2010. Our research and development focus continues to be on delivering
innovative products and solutions that meet our customers' needs, such as our industry leading APX

TM

two-way radio communications systems. These systems have
multi-band functionality that provides interoperability across various communication systems, reducing the number of devices our customers carry and enhancing communications efficiency.

The
focus for customers in our commercial enterprise market includes converged communication and computing products that increase worker mobility and productivity, as well as enhanced
end-user experiences. During 2009, many of these customers faced challenging economic conditions. These conditions have largely stabilized in recent months. Due to the postponement of capital
purchases in 2009, we believe many of our customers will upgrade their technology in 2010 to improve supply-chain efficiencies, increase productivity of associates and improve end-customer
buying experiences.

We
believe that our comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions and market leadership make our Enterprise Mobility Solutions business well positioned for profitable growth as
economic conditions across our markets improve.

In
2009, we implemented a number of global actions across the Company to significantly reduce its cost structure. To ensure alignment with market conditions, we will continually review
our cost structure as we aggressively manage costs while maintaining investments focused on innovation and future growth opportunities.

We
remain very focused on the strength of our balance sheet and our overall liquidity position. We believe we have more than sufficient liquidity to operate our business.

We
conduct our business in highly competitive markets, facing both new and established competitors. The markets for many of our products are characterized by rapidly changing
technologies, frequent new product introductions, changing consumer trends, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Market disruptions caused by new technologies, the entry of new
competitors, and consolidations among our customers and competitors, among other matters, can introduce volatility into our businesses. We face challenging, but stabilizing, global economic conditions
with more limited visibility than historical norms. Meeting all of these challenges requires consistent operational planning and execution and investment in technology, resulting in innovative
products that meet the needs of our customers around the world. As we execute on meeting these objectives, we remain focused on taking the necessary action to design and deliver differentiated and
innovative products and services that will advance the way the world connects by simplifying and personalizing communications and enhancing mobility.

What is the status of our plan to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies?

In March 2008, the Company announced that it was pursuing the creation of two independent, publicly traded companies. On
February 11, 2010, the Company announced that it is now targeting the first quarter of 2011 for the completion of this planned separation. The Company currently expects that, upon separation,
one public company will be comprised of the Company's Mobile Devices and Home businesses and the other public company will be comprised of the Company's Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Networks
businesses.

The
Company intends to effect the separation through a tax-free pro rata stock dividend of shares in the new company to Motorola shareholders. Following the separation, the Company
intends that both businesses will be well capitalized so that each of the companies can execute their respective business plans and be able to address future opportunities. The Company expects that,
post-separation, the Enterprise Mobility and Networks business



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

will
be capitalized in a manner that will achieve an investment grade rating and will be the entity responsible for Motorola's outstanding public market debt at the time of separation. Following the
separation, both entities will use the Motorola brand. The Mobile Devices and Home business is expected to own the Motorola brand and license it royalty free to the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and
Networks business. Completion of the separation is subject to a number of conditions. There can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur or, if one does occur, there can
be no assurances as to its terms or timing.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Results of Operations—2009 Compared to 2008

Net Sales

Net sales were $22.0 billion in 2009, down 27% compared to net sales of $30.1 billion in 2008. The decrease in net sales
reflects: (i) a $5.0 billion, or 41%, decrease in net sales in the Mobile Devices segment, (ii) a $2.1 billion, or 21%, decrease in net sales in the Home and Networks
Mobility segment, and (iii) a $1.1 billion, or 13%, decrease in net sales in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The 41% decrease in net sales in the Mobile Devices segment was
primarily driven by a 45% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by an 8% increase in ASP. The 21% decrease in net sales in the Home and Networks Mobility segment reflects a 22% decrease in net
sales in the networks business and a 21% decrease in net sales in the home business. The 13% decrease in net sales in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment reflects a 21%
decrease in net sales to the commercial enterprise market and a 10% decrease in net sales to the government and public safety market.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $7.1 billion, or 32.0% of net sales, in 2009, compared to $8.4 billion, or 27.8% of net sales, in 2008.
Gross margin decreased in all segments. The decrease in gross margin in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by the 41% decrease in net sales, partially offset by: (i) lower excess
inventory and other related charges in 2009 than in 2008, when the charges included a $370 million charge due to a decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms, and (ii) the
absence in 2009 of a comparable $150 million charge in 2008 related to settlement of a purchase commitment. The decrease in gross margin in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment was
primarily driven by the 13% decrease in net sales and an unfavorable product mix. The decrease in gross margin in the Home and Networks Mobility segment was primarily driven by the 21% decrease in net
sales, partially offset by a favorable product mix.

The
increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily driven by increases in gross margin percentage in the Mobile Devices and Home and
Networks Mobility segments, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The Company's overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales can
be impacted by the proportion of overall net sales generated by its various businesses. In 2009, the proportion of overall sales by our Mobile Devices business was smaller than in previous years.
Since Mobile Devices has the lowest gross margin percentage of the Company's businesses, this positively impacted overall gross margin percentage in 2009.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased 22% to $3.4 billion, or 15.3% of net sales, in 2009, compared to
$4.3 billion, or 14.4% of net sales, in 2008. SG&A expenses decreased in all segments. The decrease in SG&A expenses in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by lower marketing
expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives. The decreases in SG&A expenses in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments were primarily due to
savings from cost-reduction initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Home and Networks Mobility segments and decreased in
the Mobile Devices segment.

Research and Development Expenditures

Research and development ("R&D") expenditures decreased 23% to $3.2 billion, or 14.4% of net sales, in 2009, compared to
$4.1 billion, or 13.6% of net sales, in 2008. R&D expenditures decreased in all segments, primarily due to savings from cost-reduction initiatives. R&D expenditures as a percentage
of net sales increased in all segments. The Company participates in very competitive industries with constant changes in technology and, accordingly, the Company continues to believe that a strong
commitment to R&D is required to drive long-term growth.

Other Charges

The Company recorded net charges of $641 million in Other charges in 2009, compared to net charges of $2.3 billion in
2008. The net charges in 2009 included: (i) $278 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles, (ii) $258 million of net reorganization of business charges
included in Other charges, (iii) $42 million of costs related to the proposed separation of the Company into two independent, publicly traded companies, (iv) $39 million of
charges related to a facility impairment, and (v) $24 million of charges related to an environmental reserve. The net charges in 2008 included: (i) $1.8 billion of goodwill
and other asset impairment



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

charges,
(ii) $318 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, (iii) $248 million of net reorganization of business charges included in Other
charges, and (iv) $59 million of separation-related transaction costs, partially offset by a $48 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment. The net reorganization
of business charges are discussed in further detail in the "Reorganization of Businesses" section. The goodwill and other asset impairment charges are discussed in further detail in the "Valuation and
Recoverability of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets" section.

Net Interest Income (Expense)

Net interest expense was $132 million in 2009, compared to net interest income of $48 million in 2008. Net interest
expense in 2009 includes interest expense of $213 million, partially offset by interest income of $81 million. Net interest income in 2008 included interest income of
$272 million, partially offset by interest expense of $224 million. The significant decline in interest income reflects: (i) the significant decrease in average
short-term interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008, (ii) a change in the investment mix of the Sigma Fund to more liquid securities with shorter maturities and lower interest rates,
and (iii) the decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Fund balances in 2009 compared to 2008. This decline in interest income was slightly offset by a decrease in interest expense,
primarily driven by a decrease in the Company's level of outstanding debt during 2009.

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were $88 million in 2009, compared to gains of $82 million in 2008. In 2009,
the net gain primarily relates to sales of certain of the Company's equity investments, of which $32 million of gain was attributed to a single investment. These gains were partially offset by
a net loss from the sale of specific businesses. In 2008, the net gain primarily related to sales of a number of the Company's equity investments, of which $29 million of gain was attributed to
a single investment.

Other

Net income classified as Other, as presented in Other income (expense), was $27 million in 2009, compared to net charges of
$372 million in 2008. The net income in 2009 was primarily comprised of: (i) $80 million of gains from Sigma Fund investments, and (ii) a $67 million gain related to
the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt, partially offset by: (i) $77 million of investment impairment charges, and
(ii) $52 million of foreign currency losses. The net charges in 2008 were primarily comprised of: (i) $365 million of investment impairment charges, of which
$138 million related to a single strategic investment, (ii) $186 million of impairment charges on Sigma Fund investments, (iii) $101 million of losses on Sigma Fund
investments, and (iv) $84 million of foreign currency losses, partially offset by: (i) a $237 million curtailment gain associated with the decision to freeze benefit
accruals for U.S. pension plans, (ii) $56 million of gains related to the extinguishment of a liability, (iii) $24 million of gains relating to several interest rate swaps
not designated as hedges, and (iv) a $14 million gain related to the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt.

Effective Tax Rate

The Company recorded $77 million of net tax benefits in 2009, resulting in an effective tax rate of 47%, compared to
$1.6 billion of net tax expense, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of (61)%, in 2008. The Company's effective tax rate for 2009 was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%
primarily due to research tax credits, including a reduction in valuation allowances relating to refundable general business credits and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits for facts that now
indicate the extent to which certain tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. The Company's 2008 effective tax rate was less than the U.S.
statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the recording of a $2.1 billion non-cash tax charge to establish deferred tax valuation allowances against a portion of the Company's U.S. deferred
tax assets and the recording of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges.

The
Company's effective tax rate will change from period to period based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in valuation allowances
and the tax impact of significant
unusual or extraordinary items, as well as recurring factors including changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes and effects of various global income tax strategies.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Loss from Continuing Operations

The Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $165 million in 2009, compared with a net loss
from continuing operations before income taxes of $2.6 billion in 2008. After taxes, and excluding Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, the Company incurred a net loss from
continuing operations of $111 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in 2009, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $4.2 billion, or $1.87 per diluted share, in 2008.

The
improvement in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributed to: (i) a $1.7 billion decrease in Other
charges, (ii) a $949 million decrease in SG&A expenses, (iii) a $926 million decrease in R&D expenditures, (iv) a $399 million increase in income classified
as Other, as presented in Other income (expense), and (v) a $6 million increase in gains on the sale of investments and businesses. These factors were partially offset by: (i) a
$1.3 billion decrease in gross margin, and (ii) a $180 million increase in net interest expense.

Earnings from Discontinued Operations

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sales of: (i) Good Technology, and (ii) the Company's former
biometrics business unit, which included its Printrak trademark. After taxes, the Company had earnings from discontinued operations of $60 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in 2009, all of
which occurred during the first quarter of 2009. The Company had no such activity during the last nine months of 2009. For all other applicable prior periods, the operating results of these businesses
have not been reclassified as discontinued operations, since the results are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations—2008 Compared to 2007

Net Sales

Net sales were $30.1 billion in 2008, down 18% compared to net sales of $36.6 billion in 2007. The decrease in net sales
reflected a $6.9 billion, or 36%, decrease in net sales in the Mobile Devices segment, partially offset by: (i) a $364 million, or 5%, increase in net sales in the Enterprise
Mobility Solutions segment, and (ii) a $72 million, or 1%, increase in net sales in the Home and Networks Mobility segment. The 36% decrease in net sales in the Mobile Devices segment
was primarily driven by a 37% decrease in unit shipments. The 5% increase in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment net sales reflected an 8% increase in net sales to the government and public
safety market, partially offset by a 2% decrease in net sales to the commercial enterprise market. The 1% increase in net sales in the Home and Networks Mobility segment reflected a 16% increase in
net sales in the home business, partially offset by an 11% decrease in net sales in the networks business.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $8.4 billion, or 27.8% of net sales, in 2008, compared to $10.0 billion, or 27.2% of net sales, in 2007.
The decrease in gross margin reflected lower gross margin in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility segments, partially offset by increased gross margin in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
segment. The decrease in gross margin in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by: (i) the 36% decrease in net sales, (ii) excess inventory and other related charges of
$370 million recorded in 2008 due to a decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms, and (iii) a $150 million charge recorded in 2008 related to the settlement of a
purchase commitment, partially offset by: (i) the absence in 2008 of a $277 million charge for a legal settlement recorded in 2007, and (ii) savings from supply chain
cost-reduction activities. The decrease in gross margin in the Home and Networks Mobility segment was primarily due to: (i) an unfavorable product mix, and (ii) the absence
of net sales by the Company's former embedded communications computing group ("ECC") that was divested at the end of 2007. The increase in gross margin in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment was
primarily driven by: (i) the 5% increase in net sales, (ii) a favorable product mix, and (iii) the absence in 2008 of an inventory-related charge in connection with the
acquisition of Symbol during the first quarter of 2007.

The
increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 2008 compared to 2007 was driven by an increase in gross margin percentage in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment,
partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility segments.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses decreased 15% to $4.3 billion, or 14.4% of net sales, in 2008, compared to $5.1 billion, or 13.9% of net
sales, in 2007. SG&A expenses decreased in all segments. The decrease in SG&A expenses in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily driven by lower marketing expenses and savings from
cost-reduction initiatives. The decrease in SG&A expenses in the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segments were primarily due to savings from
cost-reduction initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in the Mobile Devices segment and decreased in the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility
Solutions segments.

Research and Development Expenditures

R&D expenditures decreased 7% to $4.1 billion, or 13.6% of net sales, in 2008, compared to $4.4 billion, or 12.1% of net
sales, in 2007. R&D expenditures decreased in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility segments, partially offset by higher R&D expenditures in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The
decreases in R&D expenditures in the Mobile Devices and Home and Networks Mobility segments were primarily due to savings from cost-reduction initiatives. The increase in R&D expenditures
in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment was primarily due to developmental engineering expenditures for new product development and investment in next-generation technologies. R&D
expenditures as a percentage of net sales increased in the Mobile Devices and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segments and decreased in the Home and Networks Mobility segment.

Other Charges

The Company recorded net charges of $2.3 billion in Other charges in 2008, compared to net charges of $1.0 billion in
2007. The net charges in 2008 included: (i) $1.8 billion of goodwill and other asset impairment charges, (ii) $318 million of charges relating to the amortization of
intangible assets, (iii) $248 million of net reorganization of business charges included in Other charges, and (iv) $59 million of transaction costs related to the proposed
separation of the Company into two independent, publicly traded companies, partially offset by a $48 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment. The net charges in 2007 included:
(i) $369 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles, (ii) $290 million of net reorganization of business charges included in Other charges,
(iii) $140 million of charges for legal settlements and related insurance matters, (iv) $96 million of acquisition-related in-process research and development
charges ("IPR&D") relating to 2007 acquisitions, and (v) $89 million of asset impairment charges. The goodwill and other asset impairment charges are discussed in further detail in the
"Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets" section. The net reorganization of business charges are discussed in further detail in the "Reorganization of Businesses"
section.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $48 million in 2008, compared to net interest income of $91 million in 2007. Net interest income
in 2008 included interest income of $272 million, partially offset by interest expense of $224 million. Net interest income in 2007 included interest income of $456 million,
partially offset by interest expense of $365 million. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower interest income due to the decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and
Sigma Fund balances in 2008 compared to 2007 and the significant decrease in short-term interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense in 2008 due to
the reversal of $89 million of interest accruals that were no longer needed as a result of the effective settlement of certain tax audits.

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were $82 million in 2008, compared to $50 million in 2007. In 2008, the net
gain primarily related to sales of a number of the Company's equity investments, of which $29 million of gain was attributed to a single investment. In 2007, the net gain primarily reflected a
gain of $34 million from the sale of the Company's embedded communications computing group.

Other

Net charges classified as Other, as presented in Other income (expense), were $372 million in 2008, compared to net income of
$36 million in 2007. The net charges in 2008 were primarily comprised of: (i) $365 million of investment impairment charges, of which $138 million related to a single
strategic investment,


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


(ii) $186 million
of impairment charges on Sigma Fund investments, (iii) $101 million of losses on Sigma Fund investments, and (iv) $84 million of foreign
currency losses, partially offset by: (i) a $237 million curtailment gain associated with the decision to freeze benefit accruals for U.S. pension plans, (ii) $56 million
of gains related to the extinguishment of a liability, (iii) $24 million of gains relating to several interest rate swaps not designated as hedges, and (iv) a $14 million
gain related to the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt. The net income in 2007 was primarily comprised of $97 million of foreign currency gains, partially
offset by: (i) $44 million of investment impairment charges, and (ii) $18 million of impairment charges on Sigma Fund investments.

Effective Tax Rate

The Company recorded $1.6 billion of net tax expense in 2008, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of (61)%, compared to
$285 million of net tax benefits, resulting in an effective tax rate of 73%, in 2007. The Company's effective tax rate for 2008 was less than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to
the recording of a $2.1 billion non-cash tax charge to establish deferred tax valuation allowances against a portion of the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets and the recording of
non-deductible goodwill impairment charges.

The
Company's 2007 effective tax rate was greater than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances and an increase in research
tax credits.

Loss from Continuing Operations

The Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $2.6 billion in 2008, compared with a net loss
from continuing operations before income taxes of $390 million in 2007. After taxes, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $4.2 billion, or $1.87 per diluted
share, in 2008, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $105 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in 2007.

The
increase in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributed to: (i) a $1.6 billion decrease in gross margin,
(ii) a $1.4 billion increase in Other charges, (iii) a $398 million increase in charges classified as Other, as presented in Other income (expense), and (iv) a
$43 million decrease in net interest income. These factors were partially offset by: (i) a $762 million decrease in SG&A expenses, (ii) a $320 million decrease in
R&D expenditures, and (iii) a $32 million increase in gains on the sale of investments and businesses.

Reorganization of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"), which permits the Company to offer eligible employees
severance benefits based on years of service and employment grade level in the event that employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of a reduction-in-force or
restructuring. Effective August 1, 2009, the Company amended and restated the Severance Plan. Under the amended Severance Plan, severance benefits will be paid in bi-weekly
installments to impacted employees rather than in lump sum payments. The Company recognizes termination benefits based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future settlement is
probable and can be reasonably estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a restructuring
plan is approved by management. Exit costs consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its accruals
for employee separation and exit costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or
because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
initiated. In these cases, the Company reverses accruals through the consolidated statements of operations where the original charges were recorded when it is determined they are no longer needed.

The
Company realized cost-saving benefits of approximately $266 million in 2009 from the plans that were initiated during 2009, representing:
(i) $119 million of savings in R&D expenditures, (ii) $95 million of savings in SG&A expenses, and (iii) $52 million of savings in Costs of sales. Beyond
2009, the Company expects the reorganization plans initiated during 2009 to provide annualized cost savings of approximately $555 million, representing: (i) $242 million of
savings in R&D expenditures, (ii) $196 million of savings in SG&A expenses, and (iii) $117 million of savings in Cost of sales.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2009 Charges

During 2009, in light of the macroeconomic decline that adversely affected sales, the Company continued to implement various
productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. All three of the Company's business segments,
as well as corporate functions, are impacted by these plans, with the majority of the impact in the Mobile Devices segment. The employees affected are located in all geographic regions.

During
2009, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $336 million, including $78 million of charges in Costs of sales and $258 million of
charges under Other charges in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Included in the aggregate $336 million are charges of $363 million for employee separation costs,
$36 million for exit costs and $20 million for fixed asset impairment charges, partially offset by $83 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

Exit Costs

At January 1, 2009, the Company had an accrual of $80 million for exit costs attributable to lease terminations. The
additional 2009 charges of $36 million are primarily related to the exit of leased facilities and contractual termination costs. The adjustments of $9 million reflect:
(i) $8 million of reversals of accruals no longer needed, and (ii) $1 million of translation adjustments. The $49 million used in 2009 reflects cash payments. The
remaining accrual of $58 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009, represents future cash payments, primarily
for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2009, the Company had an accrual of $170 million for employee separation costs, representing the severance
costs for approximately 2,000 employees. The additional 2009 charges of $363 million represent severance costs for approximately an additional 9,000 employees, of which 3,400 are direct
employees and 5,600 are indirect employees.

The
adjustments of $70 million reflect $75 million of reversals of accruals no longer required, partially offset by $5 million of translation adjustments.

During
2009, approximately 9,600 employees, of which 4,100 were direct employees and 5,500 were indirect employees, were separated from the Company. The $383 million used in 2009
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The remaining accrual of $80 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2009, is expected to be paid in 2010 to: (i) severed

employees
who began receiving payments in 2009, and (ii) approximately 1,200 employees who will begin receiving payments in 2010.

2008 Charges

During 2008, the Company committed to implement various productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term,
sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. All three of the Company's business segments, as well as corporate functions, were
impacted by these plans, with the majority of the impact in the Mobile Devices segment. The employees affected were located in all regions. The Company recorded net reorganization of business charges

Exit Costs

At January 1, 2008, the Company had an accrual of $42 million for exit costs attributable to lease terminations. The 2008
additional charges of $66 million were primarily related to: (i) the exit of leased facilities in the United Kingdom by the Mobile Devices segment, and (ii) the exit of leased
facilities in Mexico by the Home and Networks Mobility segment. The adjustments of $1 million reflect $4 million of translation adjustments, partially offset by $3 million of
reversals of accruals no longer needed. The $29 million used in 2008 reflected cash payments. The remaining accrual of $80 million, which was included in Accrued
liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008, represented future cash payments, primarily for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2008, the Company had an accrual of $193 million for employee separation costs, representing the severance
costs for approximately 2,800 employees. The additional 2008 charges of $324 million were severance costs for approximately an additional 5,800 employees, of which 2,300 were direct employees
and 3,500 were indirect employees.

The
adjustments of $60 million reflected $62 million of reversals of accruals no longer required, partially offset by $2 million of translation adjustments. The
$62 million of reversals represented previously accrued costs for approximately 600 employees.

During
2008, approximately 6,200 employees, of which 3,000 were direct employees and 3,200 were indirect employees, were separated from the Company. The $287 million used in 2008
reflected cash payments to these separated employees. The remaining accrual of $170 million was included in Accrued liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2008.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2007 Charges

During 2007, the Company committed to implement various productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term,
sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. All three of the Company's business segments, as well as corporate functions, were impacted by these plans. The majority
of the employees affected were located in North America and Europe. The Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $394 million, including $104 million of charges in
Costs of sales and $290 million of charges under Other charges (income) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Included in the aggregate $394 million were charges of
$401 million for employee separation costs, $42 million for fixed asset impairment charges and $19 million for exit costs, offset by reversals for accruals no longer needed.

and separation costs for approximately 200 employees.

Exit Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of $54 million for exit costs attributable to lease terminations. The 2007
additional charges of $19 million were primarily related to the exit of certain activities and leased facilities in Ireland by the Home and Networks Mobility segment. The 2007
adjustments of $2 million represented accruals for exit costs established through purchase accounting for businesses acquired. The $33 million used in 2007 reflects cash payments. The
remaining accrual of $42 million, which was included in Accrued liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007, represented future cash payments for lease
termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2007, the Company had an accrual of $104 million for employee separation costs, representing the severance
costs for approximately 2,300 employees. The additional 2007 charges of $401 million represented severance costs for approximately 6,700 employees, of which 2,400 were direct employees and
4,300 were indirect employees.

The
adjustments of $64 million reflected $68 million of reversals of accruals no longer required, partially offset by $4 million of accruals for severance plans
established through purchase accounting for businesses acquired. The $68 million of reversals represented previously accrued costs for 1,100 employees, and primarily related to a strategic
change regarding a plant closure and specific employees previously identified for separation who resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or who were redeployed due to circumstances not
foreseen when the original plans were approved. The $4 million of accruals represents severance plans for approximately 200 employees established through purchase accounting for businesses
acquired.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


During
2007, approximately 5,300 employees, of which 1,700 were direct employees and 3,600 were indirect employees, were separated from the Company. The $248 million used in 2007
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The remaining accrual of $193 million was included in Accrued liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2007.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company's liquidity and available capital resources
are impacted by four key components: (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) operating activities, (iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing activities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

At December 31, 2009, the Company's cash and cash equivalents (which are highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less) were $2.9 billion, a decrease of $195 million compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, $547 million of this
amount was held in the U.S. and $2.3 billion was held by the Company or its subsidiaries in other countries. At December 31, 2009, restricted cash was $206 million (including
$143 million held outside the U.S.), compared to $343 million (including $279 million held outside the U.S.) at December 31, 2008.

The
Company continues to analyze and review various repatriation strategies to continue to efficiently repatriate funds. In 2009, the Company repatriated approximately
$2.5 billion in funds to the U.S. from international jurisdictions with minimal cash tax cost. The Company has approximately $2.2 billion of earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are not
permanently reinvested and may be repatriated without additional U.S. federal income tax charges to the Company's consolidated statements of operations, given the U.S. Federal tax provisions accrued
on undistributed earnings and the utilization of available foreign tax credits. On a cash basis, these repatriations from the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries could require the payment of
additional foreign taxes. While the Company regularly repatriates funds and a portion of offshore funds can be repatriated with minimal adverse financial impact, repatriation of some of these funds
could be subject to delay for local country approvals and could have potential adverse tax consequences.

Operating Activities

The cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2009 was $629 million, compared to $242 million
provided in 2008, and $785 million provided in 2007. The primary contributors to cash flow from operations in 2009 were: (i) a $1.3 billion decrease in net inventory,
(ii) a $960 million decrease in other current assets, and (iii) income from continuing operations (adjusted for non-cash items) of $892 million, partially
offset by a $2.6 billion decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Accounts Receivable:

The Company's net accounts receivable were $3.5 billion at both December 31, 2009 and 2008,
reflecting a significant reduction in the volume of
accounts receivable sold during 2009, offset by a reduction in net sales during 2009. Compared to December 31, 2008, net accounts receivable at December 31, 2009 were higher for the
Mobile Devices and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segments and lower for the Home and Network Mobility segment. The Company's businesses sell their products in a variety of markets throughout the world
and payment terms can vary by market type and geographic location. Accordingly, the Company's levels of net accounts receivable can be impacted by the timing and level of sales that are made by its
various businesses and by the geographic locations in which those sales are made.

As
further described below under "Sales of Receivables," the Company's levels of net accounts receivable can also be impacted by the timing and amount of accounts receivable sold to
third parties, which can vary by period and can be impacted by numerous factors. Although the Company continued to sell accounts receivable in 2009, the volume of accounts receivable sold was lower
than in prior years. Total sales of accounts receivable were $1.2 billion in 2009, compared to $3.4 billion in 2008 and $4.7 billion in 2007. The lower volume was driven by both
the Company's lower net sales and the Company's strategic decision to significantly reduce accounts receivable sales. In addition, the availability of committed facilities to sell such accounts
receivable decreased due to global economic conditions and the related tightening in the credit markets.

Inventory:

The Company's net inventory was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $2.7 billion at
December 31, 2008. Net inventory
decreased in all segments and decreased substantially in the Mobile Devices segment, due to supply-chain efficiencies and lower sales. Inventory management continues to be an area of focus as the
Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

performance
to its customers against the risk of inventory excess and obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer spending requirements.

Accounts Payable:

The Company's accounts payable were $2.4 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to
$3.2 billion at December 31, 2008. Accounts payable
decreased in all segments. The Company buys products in a variety of markets throughout the world and payment terms can vary by market type and geographic location. Accordingly, the Company's levels
of accounts payable can be impacted by the timing and level of purchases made by its various businesses and by the geographic locations in which those purchases are made.

Reorganization of Businesses:

The Company has implemented reorganization of businesses plans. Cash payments for exit costs
and employee separations in connection with a number of these plans
were $432 million in 2009, as compared to $316 million in 2008. Of the $138 million reorganization of businesses accrual at December 31, 2009, $80 million relates to
employee separation costs and is expected to be paid in 2010. The remaining $58 million in accruals relate to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.

Benefit Plan Contributions:

The Company contributed $90 million to its U.S. pension plans during 2009, compared to
$243 million contributed in 2008. The Company contributed
$39 million to its non-U.S. pension plans during 2009, compared to $54 million contributed in 2008. During 2010, the Company expects to make cash contributions of
approximately $150 million to its U.S. pension plans and approximately $50 million to its non-U.S. pension plans.

The
Company amended its U.S. Regular Pension Plan, the Officers' Plan and the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan such that: (i) no participant shall accrue any benefits or
additional benefits on or after March 1, 2009, and (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant on or after March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any accrued benefit.

The
Company made no contributions to its retiree health care plan in 2009, compared to $16 million in 2008, and expects to make no contributions to this plan in 2010. Retirement
benefits are further discussed below in the "Significant Accounting Policies—Retirement Benefits" section.

Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities was $668 million in 2009, compared to net cash provided of $794 million in 2008
and net cash provided of $2.4 billion in 2007. The $1.5 billion decrease in cash flow from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to: (i) a $1.8 billion change in cash used for
purchases of Sigma Fund investments, (ii) a $165 million decrease in proceeds from sales of short-term investments, (iii) a $113 million decrease in
distributions received from investments, and (iv) a $92 million decrease in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by: (i) a $232 million
decrease in cash used for acquisitions and investments, (ii) a $229 million decrease in cash used for capital expenditures, and (iii) a $222 million increase in proceeds
from sales of investments and businesses.

Sigma Fund:

The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries invest most of their U.S. dollar-denominated cash in a fund (the
"Sigma Fund") that is designed to provide
investment returns similar to a money market fund. The Company purchased $922 million of Sigma Fund investments in 2009, compared to $853 million of net proceeds received from sales of
Sigma Fund investments in 2008 and $6.9 billion in net proceeds received from sales of Sigma Fund investments in 2007. The aggregate fair value of Sigma Fund investments was $5.2 billion
at December 31, 2009 (including $2.3 billion held by the Company or its subsidiaries outside the U.S.), compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008 (including
$2.4 billion held by the Company or its subsidiaries outside the U.S.).

The
Sigma Fund portfolio is managed by four independent investment management firms. The investment guidelines of the Sigma Fund require that purchased investments must be in
high-quality, investment grade (rated at least A/A-1 by Standard & Poor's or A2/P-1 by Moody's
Investors Service), U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and asset- and mortgage-backed securities. Under
the Sigma Fund's investment policies, except for debt obligations of the U.S. treasury and U.S. agencies, no more than 5% of the Sigma Fund portfolio is to consist of debt obligations of any one
issuer. The Sigma Fund's investment policies further require that floating rate investments must have a maturity at purchase date that does not exceed thirty-six months with an interest
rate that is reset at least annually. The average interest rate reset of the investments held by the funds must be 120 days or less. The actual average interest rate reset of the portfolio
(excluding cash and defaulted securities) was 15 days at December 31, 2009, compared to 38 days at December 31, 2008.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Investments
in the Sigma Fund are carried at fair value. The Company primarily relies on valuation pricing models and broker quotes to determine the fair value of investments in the
Sigma Fund. The valuation models are developed and maintained by third-party pricing services, and use a number of standard inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes
where the counterparty is standing ready and able to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other reference data. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to
perceived market movements and sector news may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.

At
December 31, 2009, $5.1 billion of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as current in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, compared to $3.7 billion at
December 31, 2008. The weighted average maturity of the Sigma Fund investments classified as current was 1 month (excluding cash of $0.2 billion and defaulted securities) at
December 31, 2009, compared to 5 months (excluding cash of $1.1 billion and defaulted securities) at December 31, 2008. At the end of 2009, approximately 90% of the Sigma
Fund investments were invested in U.S. government and agency obligations. This reflects a strategic decision by the Company to prioritize capital preservation rather than returns due to the
significant volatility in the capital markets throughout 2009.

In
2009, the Company recorded gains from the Sigma Fund investments of $80 million in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company changed its accounting for changes in the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
distinguished between declines it considered temporary and declines it considered permanent. When it became probable that the Company would not collect all amounts it was owed on a security according
to its contractual terms, the Company considered the security to be impaired and recorded the permanent decline in fair value in earnings. In 2008, the Company recorded $186 million of
permanent impairments of Sigma Fund investments in the consolidated statement of operations.

Beginning
in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company began recording all changes in the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund in the consolidated statements of operations.
Accordingly, the Company recorded the cumulative loss of $101 million on investments in the Sigma Fund investments in its consolidated statement of operations during the fourth quarter of 2008.
The Company determined amounts that arose in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2008 were not material to the consolidated results of operations in those periods.

During
2008 and 2007, impairment charges in the Sigma Fund were $186 million and $18 million, respectively. The impairment charges were primarily related to the default of
investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., Washington Mutual, Inc., and Sigma Finance Corporation, an unrelated special investment vehicle managed by United Kingdom-based Gordian
Knot, Limited.

Securities
with a significant temporary unrealized loss and a maturity greater than 12 months and defaulted securities have been classified as non-current in the
Company's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2009, $66 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as non-current, and the weighted average maturity of
the Sigma Fund investments classified as non-current (excluding defaulted securities) was 24 months. At December 31, 2008, $466 of the Sigma Fund investments were classified
as non-current.

The
Company continuously assesses its cash needs and continues to believe that the balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and investments in the Sigma
Fund classified as current are more than adequate to meet its current operating requirements over the next twelve months. Therefore, the Company believes it is prudent to hold the $66 million
of securities classified as non-current to maturity.

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:

The Company used $50 million of net cash for acquisitions and new investment
activities in 2009, compared to net cash used of $282 million in 2008
and net cash used of $4.6 billion in 2007. The cash used in 2009 was for small strategic investments across the Company. During 2008, the Company: (i) acquired a controlling interest in
Vertex Standard Co. Ltd. (part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment), (ii) acquired the assets related to digital cable set-top products of Zhejiang Dahua
Digital Technology Co., LTD. and Hangzhou Image Silicon, known collectively as Dahua Digital (part of the Home and Networks Mobility segment), (iii) completed the acquisition of
Soundbuzz Pte. Ltd. (part of the Mobile Devices segment), and (iv) completed the acquisition of AirDefense, Inc. (part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment).



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Capital Expenditures:

Capital expenditures were $275 million in 2009, compared to $504 million in 2008 and
$527 million in 2007. The Company's emphasis in making
capital expenditures is to focus on strategic investments driven by customer demand and new design capability.

Sales of Investments and Businesses:

The Company received $315 million in proceeds from the sales of investments and
businesses in 2009, compared to proceeds of $93 million in 2008 and
proceeds of $411 million in 2007. The $315 million in proceeds in 2009 was primarily related to: (i) the sale of the Company's former biometrics business, which was sold during
the first quarter of 2009, and (ii) proceeds received in connection with the sales of certain of the Company's equity investments. The $93 million in proceeds in 2008 was primarily
comprised of net proceeds received in connection with the sales of certain of the Company's equity investments.

Short-Term Investments:

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $2 million in short-term investments (which are
highly-liquid fixed-income investments with an
original maturity greater than three months but less than one year), compared to $225 million of short-term investments at December 31, 2008.

Investments:

In addition to available cash and cash equivalents, the Sigma Fund balances (current and non-current) and
short-term investments, the
Company views its investments as an additional source of liquidity. The majority of these securities are available-for-sale and cost-method investments in
technology companies. The fair market values of these securities are subject to substantial price volatility. In addition, the realizable values of these securities are subject to market and other
conditions. At December 31, 2009, the Company's available-for-sale equity securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value of $147 million, comprised of
a cost basis of $37 million and a net unrealized gain of $110 million. At December 31, 2008, the Company's available-for-sale equity securities portfolio
had an approximate fair market value of $117 million, comprised of a cost basis of $114 million and a net unrealized gain of $3 million.

Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $210 million in 2009, compared to $645 million used in 2008 and
$3.3 billion used in 2007. Cash used for financing activities in 2009 was primarily: (i) $132 million of cash used for the repurchase of long-term debt,
(ii) $114 million of cash used to pay dividends, and (iii) $86 million of cash used for the repayment of short-term borrowings, partially offset by
$116 million of cash received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan.

Cash
used for financing activities in 2008 was primarily: (i) $453 million of cash used to pay dividends, (ii) $225 million of cash used for the repayment and
repurchase of debt, (iii) $138 million of cash used to purchase approximately 9.0 million shares of the Company's common stock under the share repurchase program, all during the
first quarter of 2008, (iv) $90 million in distributions to discontinued operations, and (v) $50 million of net cash
used for the repayment of short-term borrowings, partially offset by: (i) $158 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swaps, and
(ii) $145 million of net cash received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan.

Short-Term Debt:

At December 31, 2009, the Company's outstanding notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was
$536 million, compared to
$92 million at December 31, 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2009, $527 million of 7.625% Senior Notes due November 15, 2010 were reclassified to current portion of
long-term debt.

Net
cash used for the repayment of short-term borrowings was $86 million in 2009, compared to repayment of $50 million of short-term borrowings in
2008.

In
March 2008, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire $114 million outstanding of 6.50% Senior Notes due March 1, 2008. In October 2008, the Company repaid, at
maturity, the entire $84 million outstanding of 5.80% Notes due October 15, 2008.

Long-term Debt:

At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding long-term debt of $3.4 billion, compared to
$4.1 billion outstanding at
December 31, 2008.

During
the first quarter of 2009, the Company repurchased $199 million of its outstanding long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of $133 million,
including $4 million of accrued interest. The $199 million of long-term debt repurchased included principal amounts of: (i) $11 million of the
$358 million then outstanding of 7.50% Debentures due 2025 (the "2025 Debentures"), (ii) $20 million of the $399 million then outstanding of


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

6.50%
Debentures due 2025, (iii) $14 million of the $299 million then outstanding of 6.50% Debentures due 2028, and (iv) $154 million of the $600 million then
outstanding of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2037. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $67 million related to these open market purchases in Other within Other income (expense) in the
consolidated statements of operations.

In
December 2008, the Company completed the open market purchase of $42 million of the $400 million then outstanding of the 2025 Debentures. The $42 million
principal amount of 2025 Debentures was purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $28 million, including accrued interest. During 2008, the Company recognized a gain of
approximately $14 million related to this open market purchase in Other within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.

The
Company believes that it will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets, though there may be periods of time when access to the capital markets is limited for all
issuers. As a "split rated credit", the Company's ability to issue long-term debt may be limited. The market into which split rated debt is offered can be very volatile and can be
unavailable for periods of time. As a result, it may be more difficult for the Company to quickly access the long-term debt market and any debt issued may be more costly, which may impact
the Company's operating and financial flexibility.

The
Company may from time to time seek to retire certain of its outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if
any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

Share Repurchase Program:

During 2009, the Company did not repurchase any of its common shares. During 2008, the Company
paid an aggregate of $138 million, including transaction
costs, to repurchase 9.0 million shares of the Company's common stock at an average price of $15.32, all of which shares were repurchased during the first quarter. Through actions taken in July
2006 and March 2007, the Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase an aggregate amount of up to $7.5 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock over a period of time.
This authorization expired in June 2009 and was not renewed. The Company has not repurchased any shares since the first quarter of 2008. All repurchased shares have been retired.

Payment of Dividends:

During 2009, the Company paid $114 million in cash dividends to holders of its common stock, all
of which was paid during the first quarter of 2009,
related to the payment of a dividend declared in November 2008. In February 2009, the Company announced that its Board of Directors suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends on the Company's
common stock.

Credit Ratings:

Three independent credit rating agencies, Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") and
Standard & Poor's ("S&P"), assign ratings to
the Company's public market debt. The following chart reflects the current ratings assigned to the Company's senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term debt and the
Company's commercial paper by each of these agencies.

December 5, 2008, downgraded long-term debt to BB+ (stable outlook) from BBB (credit watch negative) and withdrew the rating on commercial paper.

Since the Company has investment grade ratings from Fitch and Moody's and a non-investment grade rating from S&P, it is referred to as
a "split-rated credit."



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Credit Facilities

In June 2009, the Company elected to amend its domestic syndicated revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the "Credit
Facility") that is scheduled to mature in December 2011. In light of the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment and resulting capital market dislocations, the Company believed it was prudent
to restructure the Credit Facility to facilitate ongoing access to incremental liquidity. As part of the amendment, the Company reduced the size of the Credit Facility to the lesser of:
(i) $1.5 billion, or (ii) an amount determined based on eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory. If the Company elects to borrow under the Credit Facility, only then
and not before, it would be required to pledge its domestic accounts receivables and, at its option, domestic inventory. As amended, the Credit Facility does not require the Company to meet any
financial covenants unless remaining availability under the Credit Facility is less than $225 million. In addition, until borrowings are made under the Credit Facility, the Company is able to
use its working capital assets in any capacity in conjunction with other capital market funding alternatives that may be available to the Company. The Company has never borrowed under this Credit

Amounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments.

Long-Term Debt Obligations:

The Company's long-term debt obligations, including the current
portion of long-term debt, totaled $3.9 billion at
December 31, 2009, compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2008. A table of all outstanding long-term debt securities can be found in Note 4, "Debt and Credit
Facilities," to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Lease Obligations:

The Company owns most of its major facilities, but does lease certain office, factory and warehouse space,
 land, and information technology and other equipment,
principally under non-cancelable operating leases. At December 31, 2009, future minimum lease obligations, net of minimum sublease rentals, totaled $668 million. Rental
expense, net of sublease income, was $153 million in 2009, $181 million in 2008 and $231 million in 2007.

Purchase Obligations:

The Company has entered into agreements for the purchase of inventory, license of software,
promotional activities, and research and development, which are firm
commitments and are not cancelable. At December 31, 2009, the Company's obligations in connection with these agreements run through 2014, and the total payments expected to be made under these
agreements total $622 million during that period.

The
Company enters into a number of arrangements for the sourcing of supplies and materials with take-or-pay obligations. The Company's obligations with these
suppliers run through 2013 and total a minimum purchase obligation of $161 million during that period. The Company does not anticipate the cancellation of any of these agreements in the future
and estimates that purchases from these suppliers will exceed the minimum obligations during the agreement periods.

Tax Obligations:

The Company has approximately $466 million of unrecognized income tax benefits relating to multiple tax
jurisdictions and tax years. Based on the potential
outcome of the Company's global tax examinations, the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, or the continued ability to satisfy tax incentive obligations, it is
reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months. The associated net tax benefits, which would favorably impact the effective tax rate,

excluding
changes to valuation allowances are estimated to be in the range of $0 to $225 million, with cash payments not expected to exceed $125 million.

Commitments Under Other Long-Term Agreements:

The Company has entered into certain long-term agreements to purchase software,
 components, supplies and materials from suppliers. Most of the
agreements extend for periods of one to three years (three to five years for software). Generally, these agreements do not obligate the Company to make any purchases, and many permit the Company to
terminate the agreement with advance notice (usually ranging from 60 to 180 days). If the Company were to terminate these agreements, it generally would be liable for certain termination
charges, typically based on work performed and supplier on-hand inventory and raw materials attributable to canceled orders. The Company's liability would only arise in the event it
terminates the agreements for reasons other than "cause."

The
Company outsources certain corporate functions, such as benefit administration and information technology-related services. These contracts are expected to expire in 2013. At
December 31, 2009, the total remaining payments under these contracts are approximately $728 million over the remaining life of the contracts; however, these contracts can be terminated.
Termination would result in a penalty substantially less than the remaining annual contract payments. The Company would also be required to find another source for these services, including the
possibility of performing them in-house.

As
is customary in bidding for and completing network infrastructure projects and pursuant to a practice the Company has followed for many years, the Company has a number of
performance/bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding (collectively, referred to as "Performance Bonds"), primarily relating to projects of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions
and Home and Networks Mobility segments. These Performance Bonds normally have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry as a way to give customers a convenient mechanism to
seek resolution if a contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a contract. A customer can draw on the Performance Bond only if the Company does not fulfill all terms of a project
contract. If such an occasion occurred, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the Performance Bond for the amounts paid. In its long history, it has been
rare for the Company to have a Performance Bond drawn upon. At December 31, 2009, outstanding Performance Bonds totaled approximately $1.9 billion, compared to $1.8 billion at the
end of 2008. As a result of the Company's current credit ratings, issuers of these Performance Bonds may be less likely to provide Performance Bonds on the Company's behalf in the future, unless the
Company provides collateral. These limitations on issuance may apply to the renewal and extension of existing Performance Bonds, as well as the issuance of new Performance Bonds. Such collateral
requirements could result in less liquidity for other operational needs. Also, as a result of the Company's current credit ratings, there has been an increase in the cost of issuance of Performance
Bonds.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

Under the definition contained in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, the
Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements.

Long-term Customer Financing Commitments

Outstanding Commitments:

Certain purchasers of the Company's infrastructure equipment may request
that the Company provide long-term financing (defined as financing with terms
greater than one year) in connection with the sale of equipment. These requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment. The Company's obligation to provide
long-term financing may be conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing
commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from the Company. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties
totaling $406 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $370 million at December 31, 2008. Of these amounts, $13 million was supported by letters of credit or by
bank commitments to purchase long-term receivables at December 31, 2009, compared to $266 supported at December 31, 2008. The majority of the outstanding commitments at
December 31, 2009 are to a small number of network operators in the Middle East region. In response to the recent tightening in the credit markets, certain customers of the Company have
requested financing in connection with equipment purchases, and these types of requests have increased in volume and scope.

Guarantees of Third-Party Debt:

In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment customers, the Company also
assists customers in obtaining financing directly from banks and other
sources to fund equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling $31 million at December 31, 2009, compared to
$43 million at December 31, 2008 (including $27 million and $23 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term
receivables). Customer financing guarantees outstanding were $4 million at December 31, 2009, compared to



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

$6 million
at December 31, 2008 (including $2 million and $4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term
receivables).

Outstanding Long-Term Receivables:

The Company had net long-term receivables of $145 million, (net of allowances for
losses of $9 million) at December 31, 2009,
compared to net long-term receivables of $162 million (net of allowances for losses of $7 million) at December 31, 2008. These long-term receivables are
generally interest bearing, with interest rates ranging from 4% to 12%.

Sales of Receivables

From time to time, the Company sells accounts receivable and long-term receivables in transactions that qualify as
"true-sales." Certain of these accounts receivable and long-term receivables are sold to third parties on a one-time, non-recourse basis, while others
are sold to third parties under committed facilities that involve contractual commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be renewed annually. The Company may or may not retain the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and long-term
receivables.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company had $200 million of committed revolving facilities for the sale of accounts receivable, of which $60 million was utilized. At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $532 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, of committed revolving facilities for the sale of accounts receivable, of which $497 and
$817 million, respectively, were utilized. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, the Company had $435 million of committed facilities associated with the sale of
long-term financing receivables primarily for a single customer, of which $262 million was utilized. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no significant committed facilities
for the sale of long-term receivables. During the first quarter of 2009, a $400 million committed accounts receivable facility expired and was not renewed. During the second quarter
of 2009, a $132 million committed accounts receivable facility was terminated. In June 2009, the Company initiated a new $200 million committed revolving domestic accounts receivable
facility.

In
2009, the Company made a strategic decision to significantly reduce its volume of accounts receivables sold. Accordingly, although the capacity of committed accounts receivable
facilities is much lower than previous levels, the Company is not currently capacity constrained in its ability to sell receivables. However, if the Company elects to significantly increase the volume
of receivables sold in the future or if the creditworthiness of the Company's customers declines, the Company could be capacity constrained in the future.

Total
sales of accounts receivable and long-term receivables were $1.3 billion during 2009 (including $1.2 billion of sales of accounts receivable), compared to
$3.7 billion during 2008 (including $3.4 billion of sales of accounts receivable) and $4.9 billion during 2007 (including sales of $4.7 billion of accounts receivable). At
December 31, 2009, the Company retained servicing obligations for $195 million of sold accounts receivables and $297 million of long-term receivables, compared to
$621 million of accounts receivables and $400 million of long-term receivables at December 31, 2008.

Under
certain arrangements, the value of accounts receivable sold is covered by credit insurance purchased from third-party insurance companies, less deductibles or
self-insurance requirements under the insurance policies. The Company's total credit exposure, less insurance coverage, to outstanding accounts receivables that have been sold was
$27 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $23 million at December 31, 2008.

Adequate Internal Funding Resources

The Company believes that it has adequate internal resources available to fund expected working capital and capital expenditure
requirements for the next twelve months as supported by the level of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and Sigma Fund balances in the U.S. and the ability to repatriate such
funds from foreign jurisdictions.

Other Contingencies

Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying Contract Value:

In certain
circumstances, our businesses may enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the damages that could be claimed by the other party for failed
performance might exceed the revenue the Company receives from the contract. Contracts with these types of uncapped damage provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still represent
meaningful risk. There is a possibility that a damage claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result in expenses to the Company that are far in excess of the revenue received from the
counterparty in connection with the contract.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Indemnification Provisions:

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of
general warranties contained in certain commercial, intellectual
property and divestiture agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant claims asserted against the Company. However,
there is an increasing risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the current legal climate. In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making
a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. Further, the Company's obligations under
these agreements for indemnification based on breach of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, typically not more than 24 months, and for amounts not in
excess of the contract value, and in some instances the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.

Legal Matters:

The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, claims and actions, which arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Segment Information

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as
detailed in Note 12, "Information by Segment and Geographic Region," to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Net sales and operating results for the Company's three operating
business segments for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below.

Segment Results—2009 Compared to 2008

In 2009, the segment's net sales were $7.1 billion, a decrease of 41% compared to net sales of $12.1 billion in 2008. The
41% decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a 45% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by an 8% increase in average selling price ("ASP"). The segment's net sales were negatively
impacted by reduced product offerings in large market segments, particularly 3G products, including smartphones, and the segment's limited product offerings in very low-tier products. On a
product technology basis, net sales decreased substantially for GSM, CDMA and 3G technologies, partially offset by an increase in net sales for iDEN technology. On a geographic basis, net sales
decreased substantially in Latin America, the Europe, Middle East and African region ("EMEA") and Asia and, to a lesser extent, decreased in North America.

The
segment incurred an operating loss of $1.1 billion in 2009, an improvement of 51% compared to an operating loss of $2.2 billion in 2008. The decrease in the operating
loss was primarily due to decreases in: (i) selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction
initiatives, (ii) research and development ("R&D") expenditures, reflecting savings from cost-reduction initiatives, (iii) lower excess inventory and other related charges in
2009 than in 2008, when the charges included a $370 million charge due to a decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms, and (iv) the absence in 2009 of a comparable
$150 million charge in 2008 related to settlement
of a purchase commitment, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin, driven by the 41% decrease in net sales. As a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared to 2008, gross margin and R&D
expenditures increased and SG&A expenses decreased.

The
segment's industry typically experiences short life cycles for new products. Therefore, it is vital to the segment's success that new, compelling products are continually introduced.
Accordingly, a strong commitment to

R&D
is required and, even amidst challenging global economic conditions, the segment will continue to make the appropriate investments to develop a differentiated product portfolio and fuel
long-term growth.

The
segment's backlog (excluding any deferred revenue) was $409 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $290 million at December 31, 2008. This increase in
backlog is primarily due to an increase in orders in North America, particularly for 3G products, including smartphones.

Unit
shipments in 2009 were 55.1 million units, a 45% decrease compared to shipments of 100.1 million units in 2008. The overall decrease reflects decreased unit shipments
of products for GSM, CDMA and 3G technologies, partially offset by an increase in unit shipments of products for iDEN technology. For the full year 2009, unit shipments decreased substantially in
Latin America, EMEA and Asia and, to a lesser extent, decreased in North America. While total unit shipments in the worldwide handset market decreased by approximately 6% in 2009, unit shipments by
the segment decreased by a significantly higher percentage than the overall market decline.

In
2009, ASP increased approximately 8% compared to 2008. The overall increase in ASP was driven primarily by changes in the product tier and geographic mix of sales, particularly in the
fourth quarter of 2009 when the segment shipped approximately two million Android-powered smartphones. By comparison, ASP was flat in 2008 and decreased approximately 9% in 2007. ASP is impacted by
numerous factors, including product mix, geographic mix, market conditions and competitive product offerings, and ASP trends often vary over time.

The
segment has several large customers located throughout the world. In 2009, aggregate net sales to the segment's five largest customers accounted for approximately 54% of the
segment's net sales. Besides selling directly to carriers and operators, the segment also sells products through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers, which account for approximately
21% of the segment's net sales. The loss of any of the segment's key customers could have a significant impact on the segment's business.

Although
the U.S. market continued to be the segment's largest individual market, many of our customers, and 42% of the segment's 2009 net sales, are outside the U.S. In 2009, the
largest of these international markets were Brazil, China, Mexico and Korea.

Segment Results—2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, the segment's net sales were $12.1 billion, a decrease of 36% compared to net sales of $19.0 billion in 2007.
The 36% decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a 37% decrease in unit shipments. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by the segment's limited product offerings in critical market
segments, particularly 3G products, including smartphones, as well as very low-tier products. In addition, the segment's net sales were impacted by the global economic downturn in the
second half of 2008, which resulted in the slowing of end user demand. On a product technology basis, net sales decreased substantially for GSM and CDMA technologies and, to a lesser extent, decreased
for iDEN and 3G technologies. On a geographic basis, net sales decreased substantially in North America, EMEA and Asia and, to a lesser extent, decreased in Latin America.

The
segment incurred an operating loss of $2.2 billion in 2008, compared to an operating loss of $1.2 billion in 2007. The increase in the operating loss was primarily due
to a decrease in gross margin, driven by: (i) a 36% decrease in net sales, (ii) excess inventory and other related charges of $370 million in 2008 due to a decision to consolidate
software and silicon platforms, and (iii) a $150 million charge in 2008 related to the settlement of a purchase commitment, partially offset by: (i) the absence in 2008 of a
$277 million charge for a legal settlement recorded in 2007, and (ii) savings from supply chain cost-reduction initiatives. The decrease in gross margin was partially offset
by decreases in: (i) SG&A expenses, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives, and (ii) R&D expenditures, reflecting savings from
cost-reduction initiatives. As a percentage of net sales in 2008 as compared to 2007, R&D and SG&A expenses increased and gross margin decreased.

The
segment's backlog (excluding deferred revenues) was $290 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $647 million at December 31, 2007. This decrease in
backlog is primarily due to a decline in customer demand, primarily driven by the segment's limited product portfolio, as well as the global economic downturn.

Unit
shipments in 2008 were 100.1 million units, a 37% decrease compared to shipments of 159.1 million units in 2007. The overall decrease reflects decreased unit shipments
of products for all technologies. For the full year 2008, unit shipments decreased substantially in North America, EMEA and Asia and, to a lesser extent, decreased in Latin America. Although unit
shipments by the segment decreased in 2008, total unit shipments in the worldwide handset market increased by approximately 5%.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


In
2008, ASP was flat compared to 2007. By comparison, ASP decreased approximately 9% in 2007 and decreased approximately 11% in 2006.

The
segment has several large customers located throughout the world. In 2008, aggregate net sales to the segment's five largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of the
segment's net sales. Besides selling directly to carriers and operators, the segment also sells products through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers, which accounted for approximately
24% of the segment's net sales in 2008.

Although
the U.S. market continued to be the segment's largest individual market, many of our customers, and 56% of the segment's 2008 net sales, were outside the U.S. In 2008, the
largest of these international markets were Brazil, China and Mexico.

As
the segment's revenue transactions are largely denominated in local currencies, we are impacted by the weakening in the value of these local currencies against the U.S. dollar. A
number of our more significant international markets, particularly in Latin America, were impacted by this trend in late 2008.

Home and Networks Mobility Segment

Segment Results—2009 Compared to 2008

In 2009, the segment's net sales were $8.0 billion, a decrease of 21% compared to net sales of $10.1 billion in 2008. The
21% decrease in net sales reflects a 22% decrease in net sales in the networks business and a 21% decrease in net sales in the home business. The 22% decrease in net sales in the networks business was
primarily driven by lower net sales of GSM, CDMA, UMTS and iDEN infrastructure equipment, partially offset by higher net sales of WiMAX products. The 21% decrease in net sales in the home business was
primarily driven by a 24% decrease in net sales of digital entertainment devices, reflecting: (i) an 18% decrease in shipments of digital entertainment devices, primarily due to lower shipments
to large cable and telecommunications operators in North America as a result of macroeconomic conditions, and (ii) a lower ASP due to an unfavorable shift in product mix. The segment shipped
14.7 million digital entertainment devices in 2009, compared to 18.0 million shipped in 2008.

On
a geographic basis, the 21% decrease in net sales was driven by lower net sales in all regions. The decrease in net sales in North America was primarily due to: (i) lower net
sales in the home business, and (ii) lower net sales of CDMA and iDEN infrastructure equipment, partially offset by higher net sales of WiMAX products. The decrease in net sales in EMEA was
primarily due to lower net sales of GSM infrastructure equipment, partially offset by higher net sales of WiMAX products and higher net sales in the home business. The decrease in net sales in Asia
was primarily driven by lower net sales of GSM, UMTS and CDMA infrastructure equipment, partially offset by higher net sales in the home business. The decrease in net sales in Latin America was
primarily due to: (i) lower net sales in the home business, and (ii) lower net sales of iDEN infrastructure equipment, partially offset by higher net sales of WiMAX products. Net sales
in North America accounted for approximately 51% of the segment's total net sales in 2009, compared to approximately 50% of the segment's total net sales in 2008.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The segment had operating earnings of $558 million in 2009, a decrease of 39% compared to operating earnings of $918 million in
2008. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, driven by the 21% decrease in net sales, partially offset by a favorable product mix. Also contributing to the
decrease in operating earnings was: (i) a $75 million charge related to a legal settlement, and (ii) $39 million of charges related to a facility impairment. These factors
were partially offset by decreases in both R&D expenditures and SG&A expenses, reflecting savings from cost-reduction initiatives. As a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared to 2008,
gross margin, SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures increased. The segment's gross margin percentages differ among its services, software and equipment products. Accordingly, the aggregate gross margin
of the segment can fluctuate from period to period depending upon the relative mix of sales in the given period.

Due
to the nature of the segment's business, many of the agreements the segment enters into are long-term contracts that require sizeable investments by our customers. The
segment is dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of its sales. In both 2009 and 2008, sales to the segment's top five customers represented approximately 45% of the
segment's net sales. The loss of one of these major customers could have a significant impact on the segment's business and, because many of these contracts are long-term in nature, could
impact revenue and earnings over several quarters. The segment's backlog was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2008.

In
the home business, demand for the segment's products depends primarily on the level of capital spending by broadband operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their
communications systems, and for offering
advanced services. In 2009, our digital video customers in North America decreased their purchases of the segment's products and services, primarily driven by the difficult macroeconomic
conditions that forced them to reduce their capital expenditures. The reduction in purchases was also driven by the introduction of low-end digital adapters by Motorola and our
competitors.

In
the networks business, the segment has been a long-standing proponent of WiMAX and is now commercially deploying this technology to multiple customers on a global basis.
The segment has signed trial agreements for infrastructure equipment utilizing LTE technology. LTE has widespread industry support, not only from current GSM/UMTS operators, but also from
CDMA/EV-DO based carriers.

Segment Results—2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, the segment's net sales were $10.1 billion, an increase of 1% compared to net sales of $10.0 billion in 2007.
The 1% increase in net sales primarily reflected a 16% increase in net sales in the home business, partially offset by an 11% decrease in net sales in the networks business. The 16% increase in net
sales in the home business was primarily driven by a 17% increase in net sales of digital entertainment devices, reflecting a 19% increase in unit shipments to 18.0 million units, partially
offset by lower ASP due to product mix shift and pricing pressure. The 11% decrease in net sales in the networks business was primarily driven by: (i) the absence of net sales by the Company's
former embedded communication computing group ("ECC") that was divested at the end of 2007, and (ii) lower net sales of iDEN, GSM and CDMA infrastructure equipment, partially offset by higher
net sales of UMTS infrastructure equipment.

On
a geographic basis, the 1% increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher net sales in Latin America and Asia, partially offset by lower net sales in North America. The increase
in net sales in Latin America was primarily due to higher net sales in the home business. The increase in net sales in Asia was primarily driven by higher net sales of UMTS and CDMA infrastructure
equipment, partially offset by lower net sales of GSM infrastructure. The decrease in net sales in North America was primarily due to lower net sales of iDEN and CDMA infrastructure equipment,
partially offset by higher net sales in the home business. Net sales in North America accounted for approximately 50% of the segment's total net sales in 2008, compared to approximately 52% of the
segment's total net sales in 2007. The regional shift in 2008 as compared to 2007 reflected a 5% aggregate growth in net sales outside of North America and a 3% decline in net sales in North America.

The
segment had operating earnings of $918 million in 2008, an increase of 29% compared to operating earnings of $709 million in 2007. The increase in operating earnings
was primarily due to: (i) decreases in both SG&A and R&D expenditures, primarily related to savings from cost-reduction initiatives, and (ii) a decrease in reorganization of
business charges, relating primarily to lower employee severance costs. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin, primarily due to: (i) an unfavorable product mix, and
(ii) the absence of net sales by ECC. As a percentage of net sales in 2008 as compared to 2007, gross margin, SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures all decreased and operating margin increased.

2008, sales to the segment's top five customers represented approximately 45% of the segment's net sales. The segment's backlog was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2008,
compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007.

In
2008, our digital video customers significantly increased their purchases of the segment's products and services, primarily due to increased demand for digital entertainment devices,
particularly IP and HD/DVR devices.

In
February 2008, the segment acquired the assets related to digital cable set-top products of Zhejiang Dahua Digital Technology Co., LTD and Hangzhou Image
Silicon (known collectively as Dahua Digital), a developer, manufacturer and marketer of cable set-tops and related low-cost integrated circuits for the emerging Chinese cable business.
The acquisition helped the segment strengthen its position in the rapidly growing cable market in China.

Segment Results—2009 Compared to 2008

In 2009, the segment's net sales were $7.0 billion, a decrease of 13% compared to net sales of $8.1 billion in 2008. The
13% decrease in net sales reflects a 21% decrease in net sales to the commercial enterprise market and a 10% decrease in net sales to the government and public safety market. The decrease in net sales
to the commercial enterprise market reflects decreased net sales in all regions. The decrease in net sales to the government and public safety market was primarily driven by decreased net sales in
EMEA, North America and Latin America, partially offset by higher net sales in Asia. The segment's overall net sales were lower in North America, EMEA and Latin America and higher in Asia

The
segment had operating earnings of $1.1 billion in 2009, a decrease of 29% compared to operating earnings of $1.5 billion in 2008. The decrease in operating earnings was
primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, driven by the 13% decrease in net sales and an unfavorable product mix. Also contributing to the decrease in operating
earnings was an increase in reorganization of business charges, relating primarily to higher employee severance costs. These factors were partially offset by decreased SG&A expenses and R&D
expenditures, primarily related to savings from cost-reduction initiatives. As a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared 2008, gross margin decreased and R&D expenditures and SG&A expenses
increased.

Net
sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment's business, accounting for approximately 58% of the segment's net sales in 2009, compared to
approximately 57% in 2008. The regional shift in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflects a 16% decline in net sales outside of North America and a 12% decline in net sales in North America. The segment's
backlog was $2.4 billion at both December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

In
our government and public safety market, we see a continued emphasis on mission-critical communication and homeland security solutions. In 2009, we led market innovation through the
continued success of our MOTOTRBO line and the delivery of the APX™ family of products. While spending by end customers in the segment's government and public safety market is affected by
government budgets at the national, state and local levels, we continue to see demand for large-scale mission critical communications systems. In 2009, we had significant wins across the globe,
including several city and statewide communications systems in the United States, and continued success winning competitive projects with our TETRA systems in Europe, the Middle East

and
Asia. These larger systems are more complex and include a wide range of capabilities that our technological innovations are able to provide.

Customers
served within the commercial enterprise market continue to face challenging, yet stabilizing, economic trends. As these customers choose to purchase, upgrade and replace
equipment in the future, they can choose from a variety of our product offerings. During the year, we announced the new MC9500, an industrial-class rugged mobile computer, our first of its kind "rack
and rail" accessory for cost-effective and efficient back office management, as well as the MT2000 series of handheld barcode scanners that incorporates the benefits of a mobile computer.

Customer
budget constraints within all of the industries we serve have resulted in lower spending for the full year 2009 compared to 2008. However, we have recently been experiencing
stable levels of demand and we believe that our comprehensive portfolio of products and services and market leadership make our Enterprise Mobility Solutions business well-positioned for growth as the
worldwide economy begins to improve.

Segment Results—2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, the segment's net sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 5% compared to net sales of $7.7 billion in 2007. The
5% increase in net sales reflects an 8% increase in net sales to the government and public safety market, partially offset by a 2% decrease in net sales to the commercial enterprise market. The
increase in net sales to the government and public safety market was primarily driven by: (i) increased net sales outside of North America, and (ii) the net sales generated by Vertex
Standard Co., Ltd., a business the
Company acquired a controlling interest of in January 2008, partially offset by lower net sales in North America. On a geographic basis, the segment's net sales were higher in EMEA, Asia and Latin
America and lower in North America.

The
segment had operating earnings of $1.5 billion in 2008, an increase of 23% compared to operating earnings of $1.2 billion in 2007. The increase in operating earnings
was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, driven by: (i) the 5% increase in net sales, (ii) a favorable product mix, (iii) the absence in 2008 of an inventory-related
charge in connection with the acquisition of Symbol Technologies, Inc. ("Symbol") during the first quarter of 2007, and (iv) a decrease in SG&A expenses, primarily related to savings
from cost-reduction initiatives. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased R&D expenditures, primarily due to developmental engineering expenditures for new product
development and investment in next-generation technologies. As a percentage of net sales in 2008 as compared to 2007, gross margin, R&D expenditures and operating margin increased, and
SG&A expenses decreased.

Net
sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment's business, accounting for approximately 57% of the segment's net sales in 2008, compared to
approximately 62% in 2007. The regional shift in 2008 as compared to 2007 reflects 19% growth in net sales outside of North America and a 4% decline in net sales in North America. The segment's
backlog was $2.4 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007.

During
2008, the segment also: (i) acquired a controlling interest in Vertex Standard Co., Ltd., a global provider of two-way radio communication
solutions, and (ii) completed the acquisition of AirDefense Inc., a leading wireless local area network (WLAN) security provider.

Significant Accounting Policies

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Management
bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following significant accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates:

—

Revenue recognition

Revenue Recognition

The Company's arrangements with customers may differ in nature and complexity and may contain multiple deliverables, including
products, equipment, services and software that may be essential to the functionality of the other deliverables, requiring the Company to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.

Product
and equipment sales may contain discounts, price protection, return provisions and other customer incentives. The Company's recorded revenues are reduced by allowances for these
items at the time the sales are recorded. The allowances are based on management's best estimate of the amount of allowances that the customer will ultimately earn based on historical experience and
taking into account the type of products sold, the type of customer and the type of transaction specific to each arrangement. Where customer incentives cannot
be reliably estimated, the Company recognizes revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer.

The
Company's long-term contracts may involve the design, engineering, manufacturing and installation of wireless and wireline networks and two-way radio voice
and data systems. These systems are designed to meet specific customer requirements and specifications and generally require extended periods to complete. If the Company can reliably estimate revenues
and contract costs and the technology is considered proven, revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method as work progresses towards completion; otherwise, the revenue is recognized
under the completed contract method. Estimates of contract revenues, contract costs and progress towards completion are based on estimates that consider historical experience and other factors
believed to be relevant under the circumstances. Management regularly reviews these estimates and considers the impact of recurring business risks and uncertainties inherent in the contracts, such as
system performance and implementation delays due to factors within or outside the control of management.

Generally,
multiple element arrangements are separated into specific accounting units when: (i) delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis,
(ii) objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element(s), and (iii) delivery of the undelivered element(s) is probable and substantially within the
control of the Company. Total arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate accounting units based on their relative fair values (if the fair value of each accounting unit is known) or using
the residual method (if the fair value of the undelivered element(s) is known). Revenue is recognized for a separate accounting unit when the revenue recognition criteria are met for that unit. In
certain situations, judgment is required in determining both the number of accounting units and fair value of the elements, although generally the fair value of an element can be objectively
determined if the Company sells the element on a stand-alone basis. Multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting when the following criteria
are met: (i) the functionality of the delivered element(s) is not dependent on the undelivered element(s), (ii) there is vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of the
undelivered element(s), and (iii) general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element(s) have been met.

Changes
in cost estimates and the fair values of certain deliverables could negatively impact the Company's operating results. In addition, unforeseen conditions could arise over the
contract term that may have a significant impact on operating results.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Inventory Valuation

The Company records valuation reserves on its inventory for estimated excess or obsolescence. The amount of the reserve is equal to the
difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management in each segment performs
an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence. Management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis. In addition,
the Company adjusts the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost.

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, Inventories consisted of the following:

The
Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly
changing technology and customer requirements. As reflected above, the Company's inventory reserves represented 38% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2009, compared to 22% of the
gross inventory balance at December 31, 2008. The Company has inventory reserves for excess inventory, pending cancellations of product lines due to technology changes, long-life
cycle products, lifetime buys at the end of supplier production runs, business exits, and a shift of production to outsourcing.

If
future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory writedowns may be required.

Income Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company's quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or
discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the Company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as
the unusual or discrete item. The Company considers the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's effective tax
rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes reserves when it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the full tax benefit of the position. The Company adjusts
these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.

Tax
regulations may require items of income and expense to be included in a tax return in different periods than the items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a
result, the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements may be different than the tax rate reported in the income tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as
expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated
financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company
has already taken a deduction on an income tax return, but has not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

The
Company accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of the temporary differences between the book and tax
basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The Company makes estimates and judgments with regard to the calculation of certain income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by
valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant weight is given
to evidence that can be objectively verified.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


The
Company evaluates deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence, including historical and projected
taxable income and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible. As of December 31, 2009, the Company's U.S operations had generated three consecutive years of pre-tax
losses, which are attributable to the financial performance of the Mobile Devices segment. During 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility Solution businesses were
profitable in the U.S. and worldwide. Because of the losses at Mobile Devices, the Company believes that the weight of negative historical evidence precludes it from considering any forecasted income
from the Mobile Devices business in its analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. However, based on the sustained profits of the other businesses, the Company believes that the weight of
positive historical evidence allows it to include forecasted income from the other businesses in its analysis of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. The Company also considered in its
analysis tax planning strategies that are prudent and can be reasonably implemented. During 2008, the Company recorded a partial valuation allowance of $2.1 billion against a portion of its
U.S. tax carryforwards that were more likely than not to expire. During 2009, the Company increased its U.S. valuation allowance by $90 million, primarily relating to capital losses realized
from the disposition of a subsidiary, which is accounted for as part of discontinued operations, offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance for refundable general business credits. The Company
recorded additional valuation allowances relating to tax carryforwards and deferred tax assets of non-U.S. subsidiaries, including Brazil and Mexico, that the Company believes are more
likely than not to expire or go unused.

The
Company has a total deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately $2.9 billion against net deferred tax assets of approximately $6.2 billion as of
December 31, 2009, compared to total deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately $2.7 billion against net deferred tax assets of approximately $6.2 billion as of
December 31, 2008.

Management
believes its assumptions about the future performance of the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility Solutions businesses and the ability of the Company to generate
sufficient future taxable income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets are reasonable. If the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility Solutions businesses do not meet these future
forecasts or if the Company no longer deems certain tax planning strategies prudent or feasible due to changes in circumstances not currently contemplated, additional valuation allowances may be
required in future periods.

Valuation of Sigma Fund and Investment Portfolios

The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries invest a significant portion of their U.S. dollar-denominated cash in a fund (the "Sigma
Fund") that is designed to provide investment returns similar to a money market fund. Investments in Sigma Fund are carried at fair value. Investments not held in Sigma Fund generally consist of
equity and debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.

Fair
value is determined in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurement and disclosures.

Quoted
market prices in active markets are available for investments in publicly traded common stock and equivalents and, as such, these investments are classified within Level 1.

The
securities classified as Level 2 are primarily those that are professionally managed within the Sigma Fund. The valuation models are developed and maintained by third-party
pricing services and use a number of standard inputs to the valuation model, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes where the party is standing ready and able to transact,
issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other reference data. The valuation model may prioritize these inputs differently at each balance sheet date for any given security, based on
market conditions. Not all of the standard inputs listed will be used each time in the valuation models. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and sector news
may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.

Level 3
fixed income securities are debt securities that do not have actively traded quotes on the date the Company presents its consolidated balance sheets and require the use of
unobservable inputs, such as indicative quotes from dealers and qualitative input from investment advisors, to value these securities.

The
Company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might have an impact on the fair values of its investments in Sigma Fund or other investments carried at fair value.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Restructuring Activities

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"), which permits the Company to offer eligible employees
severance benefits based on years of service and employment grade level in the event that employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of a reduction-in-force or
restructuring. Effective August 1, 2009, the Company amended and restated the Severance Plan. Under the amended Severance Plan, severance benefits will be paid in bi-weekly
installments to impacted employees rather than in lump sum payments. Each separate reduction-in-force has qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan. The Company
recognizes termination benefits based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on estimates prepared at the time
a restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations. At each reporting date, the Company
evaluates its accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in
carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the
original plans were initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the income statement line item where the original charges were recorded when it is determined they are no longer required.

Retirement Benefits

The Company's noncontributory pension plan (the "Regular Pension Plan") covers U.S. employees who became eligible after one year of
service. The benefit formula is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service. Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not eligible to participate in the Regular Pension
Plan. The Company also provides defined benefit plans which cover non-U.S. employees in certain jurisdictions, principally the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Japan and Korea (the
"Non-U.S. Plans"). Other pension plans are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.

The
Company also has a noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan (the "Officers' Plan") for its elected officers. The Officers' Plan contains provisions for vesting and
funding the participants' expected retirement benefits when the participants meet the minimum age and years of service requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the Officers' Plan as
of December 31, 1999 had the option to remain in the Officers' Plan or elect to have their benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective December 31, 1999, newly elected
officers are not eligible to participate in the Officers' Plan. Effective June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The
Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan ("MSPP"), which provides supplemental benefits to individuals
by replacing the Regular Pension Plan benefits that are lost by such individuals under the retirement formula due to application of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. However,
elected officers who are covered under the Officers' Plan or who participated in the restricted stock buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective January 1, 2007,
eligible compensation was capped at the IRS limit plus $175,000 (the "Cap") or, for those already in excess of the Cap as of January 1, 2007, the eligible compensation used to compute such
employee's MSPP benefit for all future years will be the greater of: (i) such employee's eligible compensation as of January 1, 2007 (frozen at that amount), or (ii) the relevant
Cap for the given year. Additionally, effective January 1, 2009, the MSPP was frozen to new participants unless such participation was due to a prior contractual entitlement.

In
February 2007, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan and the MSPP, modifying the definition of average earnings. For years ended prior to December 31, 2007, benefits
were calculated using the rolling average of the highest annual earnings in any five years within the previous ten calendar year period. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit calculation was based on
the set of the five highest years of earnings within the ten calendar years prior to December 31, 2007, averaged with earnings from each year after 2007. Also effective January 2008, the
Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, modifying the vesting period from five years to three years.

In
December 2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, the Officers' Plan and the MSPP (collectively, the "2008 Amended Pension Plans") such that, effective March 1,
2009: (i) no participant shall accrue any benefit or additional benefit on or after March 1, 2009, and (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant on or after
March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any accrued benefit. In 2008, the Company recognized a $237 million curtailment gain associated with this plan amendment.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Certain
healthcare benefits are available to eligible domestic employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon termination of employment (the "Postretirement Health Care
Benefits Plan"). For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of January 1,
2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan has been closed to new participants.

Accounting
methodologies use an attribution approach that generally spreads individual events over the service lives of the employees in the plan. Examples of "events" are plan
amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases. The principle underlying the
required attribution approach is that employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and, therefore, the income statement effects of pension benefits or
postretirement health care benefits are earned in, and should be expensed in, the same pattern.

There
are various assumptions used in calculating the net periodic benefit expense and related benefit obligations. One of these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of
those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns and therefore result in a
pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees. Differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the net
periodic pension calculation over five years.

The
Company uses long-term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, as well as future estimates of
long-term investment returns, to develop its expected rate of return assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost and the net retirement healthcare expense. The Company's
investment return assumptions for the Regular Pension Plan and Postretirement Healthcare Benefits Plan were 8.25% and 8.5% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The investment return assumption for the
Officers' Plan was 6% in both 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Regular Pension Plan and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan investment portfolios were predominantly equity
investments and the Officers' Plan investment portfolio was predominantly fixed-income securities.

A
second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate assumptions used for pension benefits and postretirement health care benefits accounting reflects, at December 31
of each year, the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary future
cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. The Company's discount rates for measuring its U.S. pension obligations were 6% and 6.75% at December 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company's
discount rates for measuring the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan obligation were 5.75% and 6.75% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

A
final set of assumptions involves the cost drivers of the underlying benefits. The rate of compensation increase is a key assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting
and is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans for such increases. The Company's 2009 and 2008 rate for future compensation increase for the Regular Pension Plan and
Officers' Plan was 0%, as the salaries to be utilized for calculation of benefits under these plans have been frozen. For the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan, the
Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. Based on this review, the health care cost trend rate used to determine
the December 31, 2009 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is 8.5% for 2010, with a declining trend rate of about 0.7% each year until it reaches 5% by 2015, with a flat 5% rate for
2015 and beyond.

For
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized net periodic pension expense of $72 million related to its U.S. pension plans. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Company recognized net periodic pension expense for its U.S. pension plans of $64 million and a $237 million curtailment gain related to the plan amendments
that were effective March 1, 2009. Cash contributions of $90 million were made to the U.S. pension plans during 2009. The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately
$150 million to its U.S. pension plans and approximately $50 million to its non-U.S. pension plans during 2010.

The
Company recognized net postretirement health care expense of $20 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No cash
contributions were made to this plan in 2009. The Company expects to make no cash contributions to the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in 2010.

The
Company maintains a number of endorsement split-dollar life insurance policies that were taken out on now-retired officers under a plan that was frozen prior to
December 31, 2004. The Company had purchased the life insurance policies to insure the lives of employees and then entered into a separate agreement with the



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

employees
that split the policy benefits between the Company and the employee. Motorola owns the policies, controls all rights of ownership, and may terminate the insurance policies. To effect the
split-dollar arrangement, Motorola endorsed a portion of the death benefits to the employee and, upon the death of the employee, the employee's beneficiary typically receives the designated portion of
the death benefit directly from the insurance company and the Company receives the remainder of the death benefit. The Company adopted new accounting guidance on Accounting for Deferred Compensation
and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements" as of January 1, 2008. This guidance requires that a liability for the benefit obligation be recorded
because the promise of postretirement benefit has not been settled through the purchase of an endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangement. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, the
Company recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of the future death benefits as of the employees' expected retirement date of $45 million with the offset reflected as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to January 1, 2008 Retained earnings and Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the amounts of $4 million and $41 million, respectively, in
the Company's consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. It is currently expected that minimal, if any, further cash payments will be required to fund these policies.

The
net periodic pension cost for these split-dollar life insurance arrangements was $6 million for both the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The Company has
recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of the future death benefits as of the employees' expected retirement date of $48 million and $47 million as of
December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Recent
market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased the risks and illiquidity associated with certain investments held by the pension plans,
which could impact the value of investments after the date of this filing. The Company's measurement date of its plan assets and obligations is December 31.

Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets

Goodwill:

The Company tests the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is tested more frequently if
indicators of impairment exist. The Company continually assesses whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include: a sustained
significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated
competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant
impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The
goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a "component"). A
component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the
operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit.
An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. As
such, the Company has determined that the Mobile Devices segment meets the requirement of a reporting unit. For the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment, the Company has identified two reporting
units, the Government and Public Safety reporting unit and the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit. For the Home and Networks Mobility segment, the Company has identified two reporting units, the Home
reporting unit and the Networks reporting unit.

The
goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. In Step One, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the
estimated fair value of these reporting units. Fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and quoted market prices of comparable businesses. If the fair value of the
reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired for that reporting unit, and no further testing would be necessary. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
its book value, the Company performs Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and
liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit
is the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than its implied fair
value.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


The
following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the fair value of the reporting units.

•

Income Approach:

To determine fair value, the Company
discounts the expected future cash flows of the reporting units. The discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk
involved in our operations and the rate of return a market participant would expect to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, the Company uses a terminal value approach.
Under this approach, the Company uses estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of its model, adjusts it to estimate a normalized cash flow,
applies a perpetuity growth assumption and discounts it by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. The Company incorporates the present value of the resulting terminal value into
its estimate of fair value.

•

Market-Based Approach:

To corroborate the results of the
income approach described above, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using several market-based approaches, including the value that is derived based on the Company's
consolidated stock price as described above. The Company also uses the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar/guideline
publicly traded companies.

The
determination of fair value of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These
estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to
the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. For the Home, Networks, Government and Public Safety and Enterprise Mobility reporting
units, the Company assigned discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 13.5% in 2009 and 13.0% to 14.0% in 2008. The Company assigned a discount rate of 17.5% to the Mobile Devices reporting unit in 2009
and, commensurate with development stage enterprises or turnaround opportunities, 25% in 2008. The Company believes this rate reflects the inherent uncertainties of the Mobile Devices reporting unit's
projected cash flows. The Company evaluated the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units, as well as the
fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units, and concluded they are reasonable.

The
Company has weighted the valuation of its reporting units at 75% based on the income approach and 25% based on the market-based approach, consistent with prior periods. The Company
believes that this weighting is appropriate since it is often difficult to find other appropriate publicly traded companies that are similar to our reporting units and it is our view that future
discounted cash flows are more reflective of the value of the reporting units. If a heavier weighting was placed on the market-based approach, a higher fair value would have been determined for all
reporting units except Enterprise Mobility.

Based
on the results of our 2009 annual assessment of the recoverability goodwill, the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their book values, indicating that there was no
impairment of goodwill.

The
calculated fair values of the Networks, Government and Public Safety, Enterprise Mobility and Mobile Devices reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective book
values. The calculated fair value of the
Home reporting unit exceeded its book value by 10%, which is significantly lower than in prior years. This is the result of a lower calculated fair value in 2009 compared to prior years.

In
assessing the reasonableness of the calculated fair value of the Home reporting unit, the Company determined that the discount rate used to determine fair value would need to be
increased by over 2% for the Home reporting unit before its calculated fair value would be less than its book value. The Company does not believe the resulting discount rate would be reasonable
relative to the risks associated with the future cash flows of this business. The Company also determined that the terminal growth rate used to determine fair value would need to decline from 3% to
below 1% before its calculated fair value would be less than its book value. This growth rate would not be reasonable given the historical growth of the Home reporting unit's business nor the industry
expectations of the growth in the reporting unit's markets. Finally, a heavier weighting on the market-based approach would increase the calculated fair value of the reporting unit. Therefore, the
Company believes the inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Home reporting unit are reasonable.

Differences
in the Company's actual future cash flows, operating results, growth rates, capital expenditures, cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for
the purpose of calculating the fair value of each reporting unit, as well as a decline in the Company's stock price and related market capitalization, could affect the results of our annual goodwill
assessment and, accordingly, potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Following
is a discussion of the goodwill impairment charges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company experienced a sustained, significant decline in its stock price that reduced the market capitalization below the book value of the Company.
The reduced market capitalization reflected the macroeconomic declines coupled with the market view on the performance of the Mobile Devices reporting unit. The Company considered this decline in its
stock price in the impairment assessment.

Based
on the results of Step One of our 2008 assessment of the recoverability goodwill, the fair values of the Home, Networks and Government and Public Safety reporting units exceeded
their carrying values, indicating that there was no impairment of goodwill at these reporting units.

However,
the fair values of the Enterprise Mobility and Mobile Devices reporting units were below their respective book values, indicating a potential impairment of goodwill and the
requirement to perform Step Two of the analysis for these reporting units. The Company acquired the main components of the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit in 2007 at which time the book value and
fair value of the reporting unit were the same. Because of this fact, the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit was most likely to experience a decline in its fair value below its book value as a result
of lower values in the overall market and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and the market's view of its near-term impact on the reporting unit. The decline in the fair value of the
reporting unit, as measured in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulted from lower forecasted future cash flows for the reporting unit and an approximately 1% increase in the discount rate applied in the
fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to forecasted future cash flows and the discount rate applied as of the fourth quarter of 2007. The lower cash flows, projected as of December 31, 2008,
resulted from lower revenues and operating margins for future periods due to lower forecasted capital spending by the reporting unit's customers during 2009, compounded by the estimated growth from
the lower revenue base in future periods. The discount rate applied
during the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to the rate applied during the fourth quarter of 2007, increased as a result of higher observed risk premiums in the market. The decline in the fair
value of the Mobile Devices reporting unit below its book value is a result of the deteriorating macroeconomic environment, lower than expected sales and cash flows as a result of the decision to
consolidate platforms announced in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the uncertainty around the reporting unit's future cash flows.

The
allocation of the fair value of the reporting units to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting units also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, definite-lived intangible assets, pre-paid assets, deferred taxes and
current replacement costs for certain property, plant and equipment.

Based
on the results of the hypothetical purchase price allocation in Step Two for the Enterprise Mobility and Mobile Devices reporting units, the implied fair value of goodwill was $0
for Mobile Devices and $1.0 billion for Enterprise Mobility. As a result, the Company reduced the recorded value of goodwill by $55 million at the Mobile Devices reporting unit
(representing all of its goodwill) and $1.6 billion at the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit during the three-month period ended December 31, 2008.

The
accounting principles regarding goodwill acknowledge that the observed market prices of individual trades of a company's stock (and thus its computed market capitalization) may not
be representative of the fair value of the company as a whole. Additional value may arise from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another entity.
Consequently, measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of that entity's individual
common stock. In most industries, including ours, an acquiring entity typically is willing to pay more for equity securities that give it a controlling interest than an investor would pay for a number
of equity securities representing less than a controlling interest.

For
the purpose of determining the implied control premium calculation in the overall goodwill analysis, the Company applied assumptions for determining the fair value of corporate
assets. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, Sigma Fund balances, short-term investments, investments, deferred tax assets and corporate facilities. Judgments
about the fair value of corporate assets include, among others, an assumption that deferred tax assets should be discounted to reflect their economic lives, that a significant portion of the corporate
assets are required to pay off debt, fund the Company's retirement obligations, meet the near term cash requirements of the Mobile Devices reporting unit, and market participants' perceptions of the
likely restructuring costs, including severance and exit costs, that might be incurred if the Company's strategy is not successful. The results of the Company's impairment analysis result in an
implied control premium commensurate with historical transactions observed in our industry.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Long-lived Assets:

Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, long-term prepaid assets and
other non-current
assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets held for use for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events which
may indicate long-lived assets held for use may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of long-lived assets, a
significant adverse change in the manner in which the Company utilizes a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a recent history of operating or cash flow
losses, or a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of in the future. For impairment testing purposes, the Company groups its
long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities (the asset group).

If
the Company determines that a long-lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable, it compares the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset or
asset group is expected to generate over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset or asset group to the asset or asset group's carrying value. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future
cash flows exceeds the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, the asset or asset group is not considered impaired. However, if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the asset or asset group, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset or asset group and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. The fair
value of the asset or asset group is generally determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk associated with the amount and timing
of the expected future cash flows. Market-based or cost-based approaches to determining fair value may also be considered.

No
long-lived assets or asset groups held and used were tested for impairment during 2009. During 2008, the Company tested two asset groups for impairment. The first asset
group was tested for impairment when it was determined that there was a more likely than not expectation that assets associated with a technology platform of the Enterprise Mobility segment would be
disposed of or sold. This determination was made because the technology platform was no longer considered strategic to the Company. The Company determined that the expected future cash flows, which
incorporated this change in the strategic direction of the platform, did not support its carrying amount. As a result, the assets, consisting primarily of intangible assets, were written down to their
fair values. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $121 million during 2008 to reduce the carrying amount of the asset group to its fair value.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the continued operating losses of the Mobile Devices segment, the Company tested the long-lived assets of the Mobile Devices segment
for impairment. The long-lived assets of the Mobile Devices segment consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term pre-paid licenses. The asset
group also included elements of working capital, including inventory and accounts receivable. The Company considered future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and weighted them
according to management's view of their probability-weighted outcomes. The sum of these probability-weighted undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the asset group was recoverable. As a result,
no impairment of long-lived assets was recorded at the Mobile Devices segment. A significant assumption in the expected future cash flow forecast was that it was more likely than not that
management will be successful in its plans to turn around the Mobile Devices business. The plan to turn around Mobile Devices includes a successful execution of the segment's software platform
strategy and the Company's ability to execute its cost savings initiatives. Expectations of future cash flows could change if the Company determines it will not be successful in executing its plans to
turn around the Mobile Devices business. Impairment charges of the long-lived assets of Mobile Devices could be required in future periods if the Company's expectations of future cash
flows changes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new accounting guidance related to the recognition of revenue
for multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the new guidance, revenue may be allocated to the different elements in an arrangement based on relative estimated sales price. Also in October 2009, the
FASB issued new accounting standards altering the scope of revenue recognition guidance for software deliverables to exclude items sold that include hardware with software that is essential to the
hardware's functionality. This new guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still assessing the potential impact of adopting this new guidance, but anticipates adopting the guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2010 and, as
a result, deferring less revenue under the new guidance than in prior periods.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In
June 2009, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance amending the accounting for transfers of financial assets. Key provisions of this amended guidance include: (i) the
removal of the concept of qualifying special purpose entities, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a participating interest, in circumstances in which a portion of a financial asset has
been transferred, and (iii) the requirement that to qualify for sale accounting the transferor must evaluate whether it maintains effective control over transferred financial assets either
directly or indirectly. Additionally, this guidance requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a transferor's continuing involvement. This guidance will be effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2010. The Company is still assessing the potential impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for variable interest entities (VIEs). The model for
determining whether an enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new guidance. Previously, variable interest holders
had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a VIE based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the entity. In contrast, the new guidance requires
an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to qualitatively assess whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity and, if so, whether it is the primary beneficiary. Furthermore,
this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate VIEs for consolidation, rather than assessing VIEs based only upon the occurrence of triggering events. This guidance also requires enhanced
disclosures about how a company's involvement with a VIE affects its financial statements and exposure to risks. The guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. The
Company is still assessing the potential impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued guidance establishing general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements
are issued or are available to be issued. This guidance, among other things, sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may
occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its
financial statements, and the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company adopted this guidance effective with the
issuance of its financial statements for the quarterly period ended July 4, 2009. The disclosures required by this guidance are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

In
March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. This guidance, which enhances the disclosure related to derivative
instruments and hedging activities to improve the transparency of financial reporting, is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted
this guidance effective January 1, 2009. The disclosures required by this guidance are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Risk Management."

In
December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and for the loss of
control of partially owned and consolidated subsidiaries. This guidance, which does not change the criteria for consolidating a partially owned entity, is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2009. The adoption has not had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for business combinations. This guidance, which establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of
acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill and non-controlling interests and provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations, is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2009, and has applied the guidance prospectively to business combinations with an effective date on or after
January 1, 2009. The adoption has not had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. The
Company's policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into
transactions for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying
exposure. Instruments that are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as part of a hedging
relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in the market values of hedge instruments must be highly correlated with changes in market values of the underlying hedged items
both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

The
Company's strategy related to foreign exchange exposure management is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments against losses or gains on the underlying operational
cash flows or investments based on the operating business units' assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts for some of the Company's non-functional currency
receivables and payables, which are primarily denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company typically uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency
exposures. In addition, the Company enters into derivative contracts for some firm commitments and some forecasted transactions, which are designated as part of a hedging relationship if it is
determined that the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting under the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. A portion of the
Company's exposure is from currencies that are not traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, by managing net asset positions, product pricing and component
sourcing.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling $1.7 billion, compared to $2.2 billion outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset
losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the instruments, which are charged to Other within Other income (expense) in the
Company's consolidated statements of operations.

The
following table shows the five largest net notional amounts of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of December 31, 2009 and the corresponding positions as of

Foreign
exchange financial instruments that are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect reported earnings, include derivative financial instruments and other
financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the legal entity holding the instrument. Derivative financial instruments consist primarily of forward contracts
and currency options. Other financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the legal entity holding the instrument consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents,
Sigma Fund investments and short-term investments, as well as accounts payable and receivable. Accounts payable and receivable are reflected at fair value in the financial statements. The
fair value of the foreign exchange financial instruments would hypothetically decrease by $158 million as of December 31, 2009 if the foreign currency rates were to change unfavorably by
10% from current levels. This hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on future cash flows under the following conditions: (i) all current payables and receivables that are hedged were
not realized, (ii) all hedged commitments and anticipated transactions were not realized or canceled, and (iii) hedges of these amounts were not canceled or offset. The Company does not
expect that any of these conditions will occur. The Company expects that gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments should offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and future
transactions being hedged. If the hedged transactions were included in the sensitivity analysis, the hypothetical change in fair value would be immaterial. The foreign exchange financial instruments
are held for purposes other than trading.



The
Company did not have any fair value hedge activity during 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, income representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value
of cash flow hedge positions was de minimus compared to expense of $2 million and income of $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts
are included in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include the change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to
the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness. Expense (income) related to cash flow hedges that were
discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are included in the amounts noted above.

During
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, on a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $(18) million, $3 million and $(16) million,
respectively, was reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

At
December 31, 2009, the maximum term of derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was 13 months. The weighted average duration of the Company's derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was six months.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2009, the Company's short-term debt consisted primarily of $5 million of
short-term variable rate foreign debt. The Company has $3.9 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, which is primarily
priced at long-term, fixed interest rates.

As
part of its liability management program, the Company historically entered into interest rate swaps ("Hedging Agreements") to synthetically modify the characteristics of interest rate
payments for certain of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed-rate payments to short-term variable rate payments. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
terminated all of its Hedging Agreements. The termination of the Hedging Agreements resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $158 million and a gain of approximately $173 million,
which has been deferred and will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the associated debt.

Prior
to the termination of the Hedging Agreements in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Hedging Agreements were designated as part of fair value hedging relationships of the Company's
long-term debt. As such, the changes in fair value of the Hedging Agreements and corresponding adjustments to the carrying amount of the debt were recognized in earnings. Interest expense
on the debt was adjusted to include payments made or received under such Hedging Agreements. During 2008 (prior to the Hedging Agreements being terminated) the Company recognized expense of
$1 million, representing the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the Hedging Agreements. This amount is included in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's
consolidated statement of operations.

Certain
of the terminated Hedging Agreements were originally entered into during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company entered into the Hedging Agreements concurrently with the
issuance of long-term debt to convert the fixed rate interest cost on the newly issued debt to a floating rate. The Hedging Agreements were originally designated as fair value hedges of
the underlying debt, including the Company's credit spread. During the first quarter of 2008, the swaps were no longer considered effective hedges because of the volatility in the price of the
Company's fixed-rate domestic term debt and the swaps were dedesignated. In the same period, the Company was able to redesignate the same Hedging Agreements as fair value hedges of the
underlying debt, exclusive of the Company's credit spread. For the period of time that the Hedging Agreements were deemed ineffective hedges, the Company recognized a gain of $24 million in the
Company's consolidated statements of operations, representing the increase in the fair value of the Hedging Agreements.

Additionally,
one of the Company's European subsidiaries has outstanding interest rate agreements ("Interest Agreements") relating to a Euro-denominated loan. The interest on
the Euro-denominated loan is variable. The Interest Agreements change the characteristics of interest rate payments from variable to maximum fixed-rate payments. The Interest
Agreements are not accounted for as a part of a hedging relationship and, accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the Interest Agreements are included in Other income (expense) in the Company's
consolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company's European subsidiary terminated a portion of the Interest Agreements to ensure that the notional amount of the
Interest Agreements matched the amount outstanding under the Euro-denominated loan. The termination of the Interest Agreements resulted in an expense of approximately $2 million.
The weighted average fixed rate payments on these Interest Agreements was 5.34%. The fair value of the Interest Agreements at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008



were
$(4) million and $(2) million, respectively. The fair value of the Interest Agreements would hypothetically remain approximately $(4) million if EURIBOR rates were to change
unfavorably by 10% from current levels.

Counterparty Risk

The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties. However, the Company's risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments when the derivative is in an asset position. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk. At
present time, all of the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings. The Company is not exposed to material credit risk with any single counterparty. As of December 31, 2009, the
Company was exposed to an aggregate credit risk of $8 million with all counterparties.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not have any hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in foreign
operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments include cash equivalents, Sigma Fund investments, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, derivative financial instruments and other financing commitments. The Company's Sigma Fund,
available-for-sale investment portfolios and derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. All other financial
instruments, with the exception of long-term debt, are carried at cost, which is not materially different than the instruments' fair values.

Using
quoted market prices and market interest rates, the Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2009 was $3.7 billion,
compared to a face value of $3.9 billion. Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term debt is not necessarily
indicative of the amount that could be realized in a current market exchange.

Equity Price Market Risk

At December 31, 2009, the Company's available-for-sale equity securities portfolio had an approximate
fair market value of $147 million, comprised of a cost basis of $37 million and a net unrealized gains of $110 million. The value of the available-for-sale
equity securities would change by $15 million as of December 31, 2009 if the price of the stock in each of the publicly-traded companies were to change by 10%. These equity securities
are held for purposes other than trading.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(included in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

). Also, as discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-04,

Accounting for Deferred Compensation and
Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements

(included in FASB ASC Topic 715,

Compensation—Retirement Benefits

).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Motorola Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 16, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.

Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all controlled subsidiaries.
All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company's material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of activities, from the delivery of
stand-alone equipment
to custom design and installation over a period of time to bundled sales of equipment, software and services. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. In addition to these general revenue recognition criteria, the following specific
revenue recognition policies are followed:

Products and Equipment

—For product and equipment sales, revenue recognition generally occurs when products or equipment have been shipped, risk
of loss has transferred to the customer,
objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be
reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience taking into consideration the type of products sold, the type of
customer, and the type of transaction specific in each arrangement. Where customer incentives cannot be reliably estimated, the Company recognizes revenue at the time the product sells through the
distribution channel to the end customer.

Long-Term Contracts

—For long-term contracts that involve customization of the Company's equipment or software, the Company generally
recognizes revenue using the
percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs to complete the contract. In certain instances, when revenues or costs
associated with long-term contracts cannot be reliably estimated or the contract involves unproven technologies or other inherent hazards, revenues and costs are deferred until the project
is complete and customer acceptance is obtained. When current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a contract loss, the loss is recognized in the period it becomes evident.

Services

—Revenue for services is generally recognized ratably over the contract term as services are performed.

Software and Licenses

—Revenue from pre-paid perpetual licenses is recognized at the inception of the arrangement, presuming all other relevant
revenue recognition criteria
are met. Revenue from non-perpetual licenses or term licenses is recognized ratably over the period that the licensee uses the license. Revenue from software maintenance, technical support
and unspecified upgrades is generally recognized over the period that these services are delivered.

Multiple Element Arrangements

—Arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including any combination of products, equipment,
services and software. For multiple element
arrangements including software or software-related elements, the Company applies the applicable authoritative accounting guidance to determine separate units of accounting and the amount of the
arrangement fee to be allocated to those separate units of accounting. Multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting when the following
criteria are met: (i) the functionality of the delivered element(s) is not dependent on the undelivered element(s), (ii) there is vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of
the undelivered element(s), and (iii) general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element(s) have been met. If any of these criteria are not met, revenue is deferred until the
criteria are met or the last element has been delivered.

For
all other multiple element arrangements, deliverables are separated into more than one unit of accounting when the following criteria are met: (i) the delivered element(s)
have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (ii) objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element(s), and (iii) delivery of the undelivered
element(s) is probable and substantially in the control of the Company. Revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the residual
method if



objective
evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element(s). If any of these criteria are not met, revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been
delivered.

When
elements of an arrangement are separated into more than one unit of accounting, revenue is recognized for each separate unit of accounting based on the nature of the revenue as
described above.

Sales and Use Taxes

—The Company records taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions, including sales, use, value added and excise taxes,
on a net basis with such taxes excluded
from revenue.

Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash
equivalents. At December 31, 2009, and 2008, restricted cash was $206 million and $343 million, respectively.

Sigma Fund:

The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries invest most of their U.S. dollar-denominated cash in a fund (the "Sigma
Fund") that is
designed to provide investment returns similar to a money market fund. The Sigma Fund portfolio is managed by four premier independent investment management firms. The investment guidelines of the
Sigma Fund require that purchased investments must be high-quality, investment grade (rated at least A/A-1 by Standard & Poor's or A2/P-1 by Moody's Investor
Services) U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed and mortgaged-backed securities. Except for
debt obligations of the U.S. treasury and U.S. agencies, no more than 5% of the Sigma Fund portfolio is to consist of debt obligations of a single issuer. The Sigma Fund investment policies further
require that floating rate investments must have a maturity at purchase date that is not in excess of 36 months with an interest rate that is reset at least annually. The average interest rate
that is reset of investments held in the Sigma Fund must be 120 days or less.

Investments
in Sigma Fund are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company primarily relies on valuation pricing
models and broker quotes to determine the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund. The valuation models are developed and maintained by third-party pricing services, and use a number of standard
inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes where the counterparty is standing ready and able to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and
reference data. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and sector news may also be considered in addition to the standard inputs.

Investments:

Investments in equity and debt securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Debt
securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. Equity securities that are restricted for more than one year or that are not publicly traded are
carried at cost. Certain investments are accounted for using the equity method if the Company has significant influence over the issuing entity.

The
Company assesses declines in the fair value of investments to determine whether such declines are other-than-temporary. This assessment is made considering
all available evidence, including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than
cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the entity issuing the security, and the Company's ability and intent to hold investment until recovery.
Other-than-temporary impairments of investments are
recorded to Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they become impaired.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost (which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or
market (net realizable value or replacement cost).

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded
using
straight-line and declining-balance methods, based on the estimated useful lives of the assets (buildings and building equipment, 5-40 years; machinery and equipment,
2-10 years) and commences once the assets are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. The goodwill
impairment test is
performed at the reporting unit level and is a two-step analysis. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
less than its book value, the Company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit's fair value to determine the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Fair
value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses.



Intangible
assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from one to 14 years. The Company has no intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

Long-lived assets, which include intangible assets, held and used by the Company are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and
used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset (group) to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (group). If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset's fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flows analysis or market comparables. Assets held
for sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The Company evaluates deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances
are required by considering available evidence. Deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future taxable income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes otherwise payable. The
sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of
reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, taxable income in carry-back years and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible.

The
Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in
which a change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense and penalties in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's
consolidated statements of operations.

Long-term Receivables:

Long-term receivables include trade receivables where contractual terms of the note agreement are
greater than one year. Long-term receivables are considered impaired when management determines collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement,
including principal and interest, is no longer probable. Impaired long-term receivables are valued based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the receivable's
effective rate of interest, or the fair value of the collateral if the receivable is collateral dependent. Interest income and late fees on impaired long-term receivables are recognized
only when payments are received. Previously impaired long-term receivables are no longer considered impaired and are reclassified to performing when they have performed under a workout or
restructuring for four consecutive quarters.

Foreign Currency:

Certain of the Company's non-U.S. operations use their respective local currency as their functional currency. Those
operations that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency translate assets and liabilities at current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses
using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company's
consolidated balance sheets. For those operations that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, transactions denominated in the local currency are measured in U.S. dollars using the current
rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are included in
Other within Other income (expense) within the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative Instruments:

Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are marked-to-market and the result is
included in Other within Other income (expense) within the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are used to
hedge firm future commitments or forecasted transactions are deferred until such time as the underlying transactions are recognized or recorded immediately when the
transaction is no longer expected to occur. Gains or losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognized immediately as income or expense.



Earnings (Loss) Per Share:

The Company calculates its basic earnings (loss) per share based on the weighted-average effect of all
common shares
issued and outstanding. Net earnings (loss) attributable to Motorola, Inc. is divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period to arrive at the basic earnings (loss) per
share. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to Motorola, Inc. by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic
earnings (loss) per share calculation and the weighted average number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, excluding those
securities that would be anti-dilutive to the earnings (loss) per share calculation. Both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated for earnings (loss) from
continuing operations and net earnings (loss) attributable to Motorola, Inc. for all periods presented.

Share-Based Compensation Costs:

The Company has incentive plans that reward employees with stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock
and restricted stock units, as well as an employee stock purchase plan. The amount of compensation cost for these share-based awards is measured based on the fair value of the awards, as of the date
that the share-based awards are issued and adjusted to the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options, stock appreciation rights and the employee stock
purchase plan is generally determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which incorporates assumptions about expected volatility, risk free rate, dividend yield, and expected life.
Compensation cost for share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Retirement Benefits:

The Company records annual expenses relating to its pension benefit and postretirement plans based on calculations
which include
various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed asset rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial
assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The effects of the gains, losses, and prior service costs and credits are amortized over
future service periods. The funding status, or projected benefit obligation less plan assets, for each plan, is reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets using a December 31
measurement date.

Advertising Expense:

Advertising expenses, which are the external costs of marketing the Company's products, are expensed as incurred.
Advertising
expenses were $412 million, $790 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of
assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable and
long-term receivables, inventories, Sigma Fund, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations, indemnifications, and
assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits and allowances for discounts, price protection, product returns, and customer incentives,
among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience
and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances
dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency, energy markets and declines in consumer spending have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and
assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from
continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2009
presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new accounting guidance
related to the
recognition of revenue for multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the new guidance, revenue may be allocated to the different elements in an arrangement based on relative estimated sales price. In
October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards altering the scope of revenue recognition guidance for software deliverables to exclude items sold that include hardware with software that is
essential to the hardware's functionality. This new guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still assessing the potential impact of adopting this new guidance, but



anticipates
adopting the guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2010 and, as a result, deferring less revenue under the new guidance than in prior periods.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance amending the accounting for transfers of financial assets. Key provisions of this amended guidance include (i) the removal
of the concept of qualifying special purpose entities, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a participating interest, in circumstances in which a portion of a financial asset has been
transferred, and (iii) the requirement that to qualify for sale accounting the transferor must evaluate whether it maintains effective control over transferred financial assets either directly
or indirectly. Additionally, this guidance requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a transferor's continuing involvement. This guidance will be effective for the Company
beginning January 1, 2010. The Company is still assessing the potential impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for variable interest entities (VIEs). The model for
determining whether an enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new
guidance. Previously, variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a VIE based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the
entity. In contrast, the new guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to qualitatively assess whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity and, if so, whether
it is the primary beneficiary. Furthermore, this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate VIEs for consolidation, rather than assessing VIEs based only upon the occurrence of triggering
events. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about how a company's involvement with a VIE affects its financial statements and exposure to risks. The guidance will be effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2010. The Company is still assessing the potential impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued guidance establishing general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements
are issued or are available to be issued. This guidance, among other things, sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may
occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its
financial statements, and the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company adopted this guidance effective with the issuance
of its financial statements for the quarterly period ended July 4, 2009. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after December 31, 2009, through the date and time the financial
statements were issued on February 16, 2010.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. This guidance, which enhances the disclosure related to derivative
instruments and hedging activities to improve the transparency of financial reporting, is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted
this guidance effective January 1, 2009. The disclosures required by this guidance are included in Note 5, "Risk Management."

In
December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and for the loss of
control of partially owned and consolidated subsidiaries. This guidance, which does not change the criteria for consolidating a partially owned entity, is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2009. The adoption has not had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for business combinations. This guidance, which establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of
acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill and non-controlling interests and provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations, is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2009, and has applied the guidance prospectively to business combinations with an effective date on or after
January 1, 2009. The adoption has not had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.



2.   Discontinued Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company completed the sales of: (i) Good Technology, and (ii) the Company's
former biometrics business, which included its Printrak trademark. Collectively, the Company received $163 million in net cash and recorded a net gain on sale of the businesses of
$175 million before income taxes. These amounts are included in Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The operating results
of these businesses (each of which was formerly included as part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment) through the date of their respective dispositions are reported as discontinued operations
in the consolidated financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2009. For all other applicable prior periods, the operating results of these businesses have not been reclassified as
discontinued operations since the results are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its automotive electronics business to Continental AG. During the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company completed the separation and spin-off of Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. ("Freescale Semiconductor"). The financial results of the automotive electronics business and
Freescale Semiconductor were reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the discontinued
operations activity reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows primarily relates to the resolution and payment of certain indemnifications relating to a divestiture. During the year ended
December 31, 2007, the discontinued operations activity primarily relates to resolutions of certain matters with the tax authorities and payments of post-retiree medical claims to
former employees.

The
following table displays summarized activity in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company was in a net loss position and, accordingly, the basic and diluted weighted average shares
outstanding are equal because any increase to the basic shares would be antidilutive. In the computation of diluted loss per common share from both continuing operations and on a net loss basis for
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the assumed exercise of 176.4 million, 218.5 million and 209.6 million stock options, respectively, were excluded because
their inclusion would have been antidilutive. In the computation of diluted loss per common share from both continuing operations and on a net loss basis for the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, 56.3 million, 32.6 million and 9.8 million restricted stock and restricted stock units, respectively, were excluded because their inclusion would have been
antidilutive.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded gains related to the Sigma Fund investments of $80 million in Other income (expense) in the
consolidated statement of operations.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded total charges related to Sigma Fund investments, including temporary unrealized losses and impairment charges, of
$287 million in its consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded total charges of $18 million, all of which were impairment
charges, in its consolidated statements of operations.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company changed its accounting for changes in the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
distinguished between declines it considered temporary and declines it considered permanent. When it became probable that the Company would not collect all amounts it was owed on a security according
to its contractual terms, the Company considered the security to be impaired and recorded the permanent decline in fair value in earnings. During 2008, the Company recorded $186 million of
permanent impairments of Sigma Fund investments in the consolidated statement of operations. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company began recording all changes in the fair value of
investments in the Sigma Fund in the consolidated statements of operations. In its stand-alone financial statements, the Sigma Fund uses "investment company" accounting practices and records all
changes in the fair value of the underlying investments in earnings, whether such changes are considered temporary or permanent. The Company determined the underlying accounting practices of the Sigma
Fund in its stand-alone financial statements should be retained in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company recorded the cumulative loss of $101 million on
investments in the Sigma Fund investments in its consolidated statement of operations during the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company determined amounts that arose in periods prior to the fourth
quarter of 2008 were not material to the consolidated results of operations in those periods.

Securities
with a significant temporary unrealized loss and a maturity greater than 12 months and defaulted securities have been classified as non-current in the
Company's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2009, $66 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as non-current, and the weighted average maturity of
the Sigma Fund investments classified as non-current (excluding defaulted securities) was 24 months. At December 31, 2008, $466 million of the Sigma Fund investments
were classified as non-current, and the weighted average maturity of the Sigma Fund investments classified as non-current (excluding defaulted securities) was 16 months.

During 2009, the Company repurchased $199 million of its outstanding long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of $133 million, including
$4 million of accrued interest, all of which occurred during the three months ended April 4, 2009. The $199 million of long-term debt repurchased included principal
amounts of: (i) $11 million of the $358 million then outstanding of the 7.50% Debentures due 2025 (the "2025 Debentures"), (ii) $20 million of the
$399 million then outstanding of the 6.50% Debentures due 2025, (iii) $14 million of the $299 million then outstanding of the 6.50% Debentures due 2028, and
(iv) $154 million of the $600 million then outstanding of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2037. The Company recognized a gain of
approximately $67 million related to these open market purchases in Other within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.

In
December 2008, the Company completed the open market purchase of $42 million of the $400 million then aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 2025 Debentures. The
$42 million principal amount of 2025 Debentures was purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $28 million, including accrued interest as of the redemption date. During
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $14 million related to this open market purchase in Other within Other income (expense) in the
consolidated statements of operations.



In
October 2008, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire $84 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 5.80% Notes due October 15, 2008. In March 2008, the
Company repaid at maturity, the entire $114 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 6.50% Notes due March 1, 2008.

Aggregate
requirements for long-term debt maturities during the next five years are as follows: 2010—$531 million; 2011—$604 million;
2012—$405 million; 2013—$5 million; and 2014—$4 million.

Credit Facilities

In June 2009, the Company elected to amend its domestic syndicated revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the "Credit
Facility") that is scheduled to mature in December 2011. As part of the amendment, the Company reduced the size of the Credit Facility to the lesser of: (i) $1.5 billion, or
(ii) an amount determined based on eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory. If the Company elects to borrow under the Credit Facility, it would be required to pledge its domestic
accounts receivables and, at its option, domestic inventory. As amended, the Credit Facility does not require the Company to meet any financial covenants unless remaining availability under the Credit
Facility is less than $225 million. In addition, until borrowings are made under the Credit Facility, the Company is able to use its working capital assets in any capacity in conjunction with
other capital market funding alternatives that may be available to the Company. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit
Facility.

At
December 31, 2009, the commitment fee assessed against the daily average amounts unused was 75 basis points.

The
Company's current corporate credit ratings are "BBB-" with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), "Baa3" with a negative outlook by Moody's Investors Service
("Moody's"), and "BB+" with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor's ("S&P").

5.   Risk Management

Derivative Financial Instruments

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. The
Company's policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into
transactions for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be effective at reducing the risk associated
with the exposure being hedged and are designated as part of a hedging relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in the market values of hedge instruments must be highly
correlated with changes in market values of the underlying hedged items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

The
Company's strategy related to foreign exchange exposure management is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments against losses or gains on the underlying operational
cash flows or investments based on the operating business units' assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts for some of the Company's non-functional currency
receivables and payables, which are primarily denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company typically uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency
exposures. In addition, the Company enters into derivative contracts for some firm commitments and some forecasted transactions, which are designated as part of a hedging relationship if it is
determined that the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting under the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. A portion of the
Company's exposure is from currencies that are not traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, by managing net asset positions, product pricing and component
sourcing.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling $1.7 billion, compared to $2.2 billion outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset
losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the instruments, which are charged to Other within Other income (expense) in the
Company's consolidated statements of operations.

The Company did not have any fair value hedge activity during 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, income representing the ineffective portions of changes
in the fair value of cash flow hedge positions was de minimus compared to expense of $2 million and income of $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. These amounts are included in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include the change in the fair value of
derivative contracts related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness. Expense (income) related to
cash flow hedges that were discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are included in the amounts noted above.

During
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, on a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $(18) million, $3 million and $(16) million, respectively, was
reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

At
December 31, 2009, the maximum term of derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was 13 months. The weighted average duration of the Company's derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was six months.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2009, the Company's short-term debt consisted primarily of $5 million of
short-term variable rate foreign debt. The Company has $3.9 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, which is primarily
priced at long-term, fixed interest rates.

As
part of its liability management program, the Company historically entered into interest rate swaps ("Hedging Agreements") to synthetically modify the characteristics of interest rate
payments for certain of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed-rate payments to short-term variable rate payments. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
terminated all of its Hedging Agreements. The termination of the Hedging Agreements resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $158 million and a gain of approximately $173 million,
which has been deferred and will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the associated debt.

Prior
to the termination of the Hedging Agreements in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Hedging Agreements were designated as part of fair value hedging relationships of the Company's
long-term debt. As such, the changes in fair value of the Hedging Agreements and corresponding adjustments to the carrying amount of the debt were recognized in earnings. Interest expense
on the debt was adjusted to include payments made or received under such Hedging Agreements. During 2008 (prior to the Hedging Agreements being terminated) the
Company recognized expense of $1 million, representing the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the Hedging Agreements. This amount is included in Other within Other income
(expense) in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.

Certain
of the terminated Hedging Agreements were originally entered into during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company entered into the Hedging Agreements concurrently with the
issuance of long-term debt to convert the fixed rate interest cost on the newly issued debt to a floating rate. The Hedging Agreements were originally designated as fair value hedges of
the underlying debt, including the Company's credit spread. During the first quarter of 2008, the swaps were no longer considered effective hedges because of the volatility in the price of the
Company's fixed-rate domestic term debt and the swaps were dedesignated. In the same period, the Company was able to redesignate the same Hedging Agreements as fair value hedges of the
underlying debt, exclusive of the Company's credit spread. For the period of time that the Hedging Agreements were deemed ineffective hedges, the Company recognized a gain of $24 million in the
Company's consolidated statements of operations, representing the increase in the fair value of the Hedging Agreements.



Additionally,
one of the Company's European subsidiaries has outstanding interest rate agreements ("Interest Agreements") relating to a Euro-denominated loan. The interest on
the Euro-denominated loan is variable. The Interest Agreements change the characteristics of interest rate payments from variable to maximum fixed-rate payments. The Interest
Agreements are not accounted for as a part of a hedging relationship and, accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the Interest Agreements are included in Other income (expense) in the Company's
consolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company's European subsidiary terminated a portion of the Interest Agreements to ensure that the notional amount of the
Interest Agreements matched the amount outstanding under the Euro-denominated loan. The termination of the Interest Agreements resulted in an expense of approximately $2 million.
The weighted average fixed rate payments on these Interest Agreements was 5.34%. The fair value of the Interest Agreements at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were $(4) million
and $(2) million, respectively.

Counterparty Risk

The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties. However, the Company's risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments when the derivative is in an asset position. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk. At
present time, all of the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings. The Company is not exposed to material credit risk with any single counterparty. As of December 31, 2009, the
Company was exposed to an aggregate credit risk of $8 million with all counterparties.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments include cash equivalents, Sigma Fund investments, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, derivative financial instruments and other financing commitments. The Company's Sigma Fund,
available-for-sale investment portfolios and derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. All other financial
instruments, with the exception of long-term debt, are carried at cost, which is not materially different than the instruments' fair values.

Using
quoted market prices and market interest rates, the Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2009 was $3.7 billion,
compared to a face value of $3.9 billion. Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term debt is not necessarily
indicative of the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.

Equity Price Market Risk

At December 31, 2009, the Company's available-for-sale equity securities portfolio had an approximate
fair market value of $147 million, which represented a cost basis of $37 million and a net unrealized gains of $110 million. These equity securities are held for purposes other
than trading.

Deferred
tax charges (benefits) that were recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company's consolidated balance sheets resulted from retirement benefit
adjustments, currency translation adjustments, net gains (losses) on derivative instruments and fair value adjustments to available-for-sale securities. The adjustments were
($25) million, ($738) million and $306 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Except for certain earnings that the Company intends to reinvest
indefinitely, provisions have been made for the estimated U.S. federal income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Undistributed earnings that the Company
intends to reinvest indefinitely, and for which no U.S. federal income taxes have been provided,
aggregate to $2.4 billion, $2.9 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The portion of earnings not reinvested indefinitely may be distributed
without an additional U.S. federal income tax charge given the U.S. federal tax accrued on undistributed earnings and the utilization of available foreign tax credits.

The
Company accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of the temporary differences between the book and tax
basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The Company makes estimates and judgments with regard to the calculation of certain income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by
valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant weight is given
to evidence that can be objectively verified.

The
Company evaluates deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence, including historical and projected
taxable income and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible. As of December 31, 2009, the Company's U.S. operations had generated three consecutive years of
pre-tax losses, which are attributable to the Mobile Devices segment. During 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Home and Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility Solution businesses were profitable
in the U.S. and worldwide. Because of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 losses at Mobile Devices, the Company believes that the weight of negative historic evidence precludes it from considering any forecasted
income from the Mobile Devices business in its analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. However, based on the sustained profits of the other businesses, the Company believes that the
weight of positive historic evidence allows it to include forecasted income from the other businesses in its analysis of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. The Company also considered in
its analysis tax planning strategies that are prudent and can be reasonably implemented. During 2008, the Company recorded a partial valuation allowance of $2.1 billion against a portion of its
U.S. tax carry forwards that were more likely than not to expire. During 2009, the Company increased its U.S. valuation allowance by $90 million, primarily relating to capital losses realized
from the disposition of a subsidiary, which is accounted for as part of discontinued operations, offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance for refundable general business credits. The Company
recorded additional valuation allowances relating to tax carryforwards and deferred tax assets of non-U.S. subsidiaries, including Brazil and Mexico that the Company believes are more
likely than not to expire or go unused.

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had valuation allowances of $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, against its deferred tax assets, including
$422 million and $297 million, respectively, relating to deferred tax assets for non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company's valuation allowances for its non-U.S.
subsidiaries had a net increase of $125 million during 2009. The increase is primarily caused by exchange rate variances and the creation of additional valuation allowances in Brazil and
Mexico. The U.S. valuation allowance relates primarily to tax carryforwards, including foreign tax credits, general business credits and tax carryforwards of acquired businesses which have limitations
upon their use, state tax carryforwards and future capital losses related to certain investments. The Company believes that the remaining deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable
based on estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies.

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded its Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audits for tax years 1996-2003. As a result of the foregoing and
resolution of certain Non-U.S. audits, the Company reduced its unrecognized tax benefits by $463 million, of which $31 million was recognized as a tax benefit and the
remainder primarily reduced tax carry forwards and other deferred tax assets. In relation to the Company's 1996-2003 IRS audit resolution, the Company received a $126 million tax
refund and $62 million interest refund during the third quarter of 2009. The refunds primarily relate to tax refund claims dating prior to the 1996-2003 audit cycle, which were held
pending the final resolution of the 1996-2003 audit cycle. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recognized $16 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which resulted
from the favorable resolution of a matter with Non-U.S. tax authorities.



The
IRS is currently examining the Company's 2006 and 2007 tax years. The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits pending. A summary of open tax years by major
jurisdiction is presented below:

Although the final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes is uncertain, based on current information, in the opinion of the Company's
management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, an
unfavorable resolution of the Company's global tax disputes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the periods in
which the matters are ultimately resolved.

Based
on the potential outcome of the Company's global tax examinations, the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, or the continued ability to satisfy tax
incentive obligations, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months. The associated net tax benefits, which would favorably impact the
effective tax rate, excluding changes to valuation allowances, are estimated to be in the range of $0 to $225 million, with cash payments in the range of $0 to $125 million.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company had $25 million and $15 million accrued for interest and penalties, respectively, on unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2008, the
Company had $47 million and $11 million accrued for interest and penalties, respectively, on unrecognized tax benefits.

7.   Retirement Benefits

Pension Benefit Plans

The Company's noncontributory pension plan (the "Regular Pension Plan") covers U.S. employees who became eligible after one year of
service. The benefit formula is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service. Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not eligible to participate in the Regular Pension
Plan. The Company also provides defined benefit plans which cover non-U.S. employees in certain jurisdictions, principally the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Japan and Korea (the
"Non-U.S. Plans"). Other pension plans are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.

The
Company has a noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan (the "Officers' Plan") for its officers elected prior to December 31, 1999. The Officers' Plan contains
provisions for vesting and funding the participants' expected retirement benefits when the participants meet the minimum age and years of service requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested
in the Officers' Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option to remain in the Officers' Plan or elect to have their benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective December 31,
1999, newly elected officers are not eligible to participate in the Officers' Plan. Effective June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The
Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan ("MSPP"), which provides supplemental benefits to individuals
by replacing the Regular Pension Plan benefits that are lost by such individuals under the retirement formula due to application of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. However,
elected officers who are covered under the Officers' Plan or who participated in the restricted stock buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective January 1, 2007,
eligible compensation was capped at the IRS limit plus $175,000 (the "Cap") or, for those



already
in excess of the Cap as of January 1, 2007, the eligible compensation used to compute such employee's MSPP benefit for all future years will be the greater of: (i) such
employee's eligible compensation as of January 1, 2007 (frozen at that amount), or (ii) the relevant Cap for the given year. Additionally, effective January 1, 2009, the MSPP was
closed to new participants unless such participation was required under a prior contractual entitlement.

In
February 2007, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan and the MSPP, modifying the definition of average earnings. For the years ended prior to December 31, 2007, benefits
were calculated using the rolling average of the highest annual earnings in any five years within the previous ten calendar year period. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit calculation was based on
the set of the five highest years of earnings within the ten calendar years prior to December 31, 2007, averaged with earnings from each year after 2007. In addition, effective January 2008,
the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, modifying the vesting period from five years to three years.

In
December 2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, the Officers' Plan and the MSPP. Effective March 1, 2009, (i) no participant shall accrue any benefit or
additional benefit on and after March 1, 2009, and (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant on and after March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any accrued benefit.
Additionally, no service performed on and after March 1, 2009, shall be considered service for any purpose under the MSPP. The Company recognized a $237 million curtailment gain
associated with this plan amendment in 2008.

The
net periodic pension cost (benefit) for the Regular Pension Plan, Officers' Plan and MSPP and Non-U.S. plans was as follows:

It is estimated that the net periodic cost for 2010 will include amortization of the unrecognized net loss and prior service costs for the Regular Plan, Officers' and
MSPP Plans, and Non-U.S. Plans, currently included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), of $151 million, $2 million, and $15 million, respectively.



The
Company uses a five-year, market-related asset value method of amortizing asset-related gains and losses. Prior service costs are being amortized over periods ranging
from 11 to 12 years. Benefits under all pension plans are valued based upon the projected unit credit cost method.

Certain
actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic
cost and benefit obligation. The assumed discount rates reflect the prevailing market rates of a universe of high-quality, non-callable, corporate bonds currently available
that, if the obligation were settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. The long-term rates of return on plan
assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, cash and other investments similar to the actual investment
mix. In determining the long-term return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the
Company expects the plan funds to be invested.

The Company has adopted a pension investment policy designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption. To achieve this, the pension plans
retain professional investment managers that invest plan assets in equity and fixed income securities and cash. In addition, some plans invest in insurance contracts. The Company's measurement date of
its plan assets and obligations is December 31. The Company has the following target mixes for these asset classes, which are readjusted periodically, when an asset class weighting deviates
from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the required return at a reasonable risk level:

Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded debt securities ranging from U.S. Treasury issues, corporate debt
securities, mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as international debt securities. In the cash and other investments asset class, investments may be in cash, cash equivalents or insurance
contracts.

The
Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $150 million to its U.S. pension plans and approximately $50 million to its non-U.S. pension
plans in 2010.

Postretirement Health Care Plan

Certain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon termination
of employment (the "Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan"). For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the postretirement medical costs to the
retired participant. As of January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan has been closed to new participants. The benefit obligation and plan assets for the Postretirement Health
Care Benefit Plan have been measured as of December 31, 2009.

The
Company has adopted an investment policy for plan assets designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption. To achieve this, the plan retains
professional investment managers that invest plan assets in equity and fixed income securities and cash. The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience with consideration
of the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, as well as future estimates of long-term investment returns, to develop its expected rate of return assumption used in calculating the
net periodic cost and the net retirement healthcare expense. The Company has the following target mixes for these asset classes, which are readjusted at least periodically, when an asset class
weighting deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the required return at a reasonable risk level:

2015-2019


The
health care trend rate used to determine the December 31, 2009 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is 8.5% for 2010. Beyond 2010, the rate is assumed to decrease by
about 0.7% per year until it reaches 5% by 2015 and then remains flat. The health care trend rate used to determine the December 31, 2008 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5%.

Changing
the health care trend rate by one percentage point would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the net retiree health care expense as follows:

The
Company maintains a lifetime cap on postretirement health care costs, which reduces the liability duration of the plan. A result of this lower duration is a decreased sensitivity to
a change in the discount rate trend assumption with respect to the liability and related expense.

The
Company has no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside the United States.

Other Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a number of endorsement split-dollar life insurance policies that were taken out on now-retired
officers under a plan that was frozen prior to December 31, 2004. The Company had purchased the life insurance policies to insure the lives of employees and then entered into a separate
agreement with the employees that split the policy benefits between the Company and the employee. Motorola owns the policies, controls all rights of ownership, and may terminate the insurance
policies. To effect the split-dollar arrangement, Motorola endorsed a portion of the death benefits to the employee and upon the death of the employee, the employee's beneficiary typically receives
the designated portion of the death benefits directly from the insurance company and the Company receives the remainder of the death benefits.

The
Company adopted new accounting guidance on accounting for split-dollar life insurance arrangements as of January 1, 2008. This guidance requires that a liability for the
benefit obligation be recorded because the promise of postretirement benefit had not been settled through the purchase of an endorsement split-dollar life



insurance
arrangement. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, the Company recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of the future death benefits as of the employees'
expected retirement date of $45 million with the offset reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment to January 1, 2008 Retained earnings and Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
in the amounts of $4 million and $41 million, respectively, in the Company's consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. It is currently expected that minimal, if any, further cash
payments will be required to fund these policies.

The
net periodic cost for these split-dollar life insurance arrangements was $6 million in both the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The Company has recorded a
liability representing the actuarial present value of the future death benefits as of the employees' expected retirement date of $48 million and $47 million as of December 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Defined Contribution Plan

The Company and certain subsidiaries have various defined contribution plans, in which all eligible employees participate. In the U.S.,
the 401(k) plan is a contributory plan. Matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees' contributions. Effective January 1, 2005, newly hired employees have a higher maximum
matching contribution at 4% on the first 5% of employee contributions, compared to 3% on the first 6% of employee contributions for employees hired prior to January 2005. Effective January 1,
2009, the Company temporarily suspended all matching contributions to the Motorola 401(k) plan. The Company's expenses, primarily relating to the employer match, for all defined contribution plans,
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $8 million, $95 million and $116 million, respectively.

8.   Share-Based Compensation Plans and Other Incentive Plans

Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company grants options to acquire shares of common stock to certain employees, and existing option holders in connection with the
merging of option plans following an acquisition. Each option granted and stock appreciation right has an exercise price of no less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of the grant. The awards have a contractual life of five to ten years and vest over two to four years. Stock options and stock appreciation rights assumed or replaced with comparable stock options or
stock appreciation rights in conjunction with a change in control only become exercisable if the
holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or quits for good reason within 24 months of a change in control.

The
employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible compensation on an
after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than $25,000 of stock in any calendar year. The price an employee pays per share is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the
Company's stock on the close of the first trading day or last trading day of the purchase period. The plan has two purchase periods, the first one from October 1 through March 31 and the
second one from April 1 through September 30. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, employees purchased 29.4 million, 18.9 million and
10.2 million shares, respectively, at purchase prices of $3.60 and $3.68, $7.91 and $6.07, and $14.93 and $15.02, respectively.

The
Company calculates the value of each employee stock option, estimated on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average estimated fair value of
employee stock options granted during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $2.78, $3.47 and $5.95, respectively, using the following weighted-average assumptions:

4.5

%

Dividend yield

0.0

%

2.7

%

1.1

%

Expected life (years)

3.9

The Company uses the implied volatility for traded options on the Company's stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. The
selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the Company's stock and the Company's assessment that implied volatility is more
representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.

The
risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the average daily closing rates during the year for U.S. treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected
life of the option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's future expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents the average of the
contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period for all option tranches.

The
Company has applied a forfeiture rate, estimated based on historical data, of 13%-45% to the option fair value calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This
estimated forfeiture rate is applied to grants based on their remaining vesting term and may be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from this estimate.

stock purchase plan that will be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately one year. Cash received from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan was
$116 million, $145 million and $440 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $1 million, $2 million and $177 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and
exercisable as of December 31, 2009 was $128 million and $27 million, respectively, based on a December 31, 2009 stock price of $7.76 per share.

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, 60.5 million shares and 72.2 million shares, respectively, were available for future share-based award grants under the 2006 Motorola
Omnibus Plan, covering all equity awards to employees and non-employee directors.

The

Stock Option Exchange

On May 14, 2009, the Company initiated a tender offer for certain eligible employees (excluding executive officers and
directors) to exchange certain out-of-the-money options for new options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock as of the grant
date. In order to be eligible for the exchange, the options had to have been granted prior to June 1, 2007, expire after December 31, 2009 and have an exercise price equal to or greater
than $12.00. The offering period closed on June 12, 2009. On that date, 97 million options were tendered and exchanged for 43 million new options with an exercise price of $6.73
and a ratable annual vesting period over two years. The exchange program was designed so that the fair market value of the new options would approximate the fair market value of the options exchanged.
The resulting incremental compensation expense was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock ("RS") and restricted stock unit ("RSU") grants consist of shares or the rights to shares of the Company's common
stock which are awarded to employees and non-employee directors. The grants are restricted such that they are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and to restrictions on their sale or
other transfer by the employee. Shares of RS and RSUs assumed or replaced with comparable shares of RS or RSUs in conjunction with a change in control will only have the restrictions lapse if the
holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or quits for good reason within 24 months of a change in control.

Motorola Incentive Plan

The Motorola Incentive Plan provides eligible employees with an annual payment, calculated as a percentage of an employee's eligible
earnings, in the year after the close of the current calendar year if specified business goals and individual performance targets are met. The provisions for awards under these incentive plans for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $190 million, $172 million and $190 million, respectively.

Long-Range Incentive Plan

The Long-Range Incentive Plan ("LRIP") rewards participating elected officers for the Company's achievement of specified
business goals during the period, based on two performance objectives measured over three-year cycles. The provision for LRIP (net of the reversals of previously recognized reserves) for
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $9 million, $(13) million and $(8) million, respectively.

9.   Fair Value Measurements

The Company adopted new accounting guidance on measuring fair value on January 1, 2008 for all financial assets and liabilities and
non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. This does not change the accounting for those
instruments that were, under previous U.S. GAAP, accounted for at cost or contract value. The Company has no non-financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009.

The
Company holds certain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which must be measured using the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value hierarchy and
related valuation methodologies. The guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect
market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumptions about current market conditions. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related valuation
methodologies are as follows:

Level 1

—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2

—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are
not active and model-derived
valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

Level 3

—Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.



The
fair values of the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Valuation Methodologies

Level 1

—Quoted market prices in active markets are available for
investments in common and preferred stock and common stock equivalents. As such, these investments are classified within Level 1.

Level 2

—The securities classified as Level 2 are comprised primarily of corporate, government and agency bonds.
The Company primarily relies on valuation pricing models, recent bid prices, and broker quotes to determine the fair value of these securities. The valuation models for Level 2 assets are
developed and maintained by third party pricing services and use a number of standard inputs to the valuation model including benchmark
yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes where the party is standing ready and able to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other reference data. The valuation model
may prioritize these inputs differently at each balance sheet date for any given security, based on the market conditions. Not all of the standard inputs listed will be used each time in the valuation
models. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and sector news may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.



Corporate
bonds held within the pension plan assets are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.

In
determining the fair value of the Company's foreign currency derivatives, the Company uses forward contract and option valuation models employing market observable inputs, such as
spot currency rates, time value and option volatilities. Since the Company primarily uses observable inputs in its valuation of its derivative assets and liabilities, they are classified as
Level 2 assets.

The
fair values of investments in collective trust funds are valued based on their reported net asset value. Such net asset values are based on the value of the underlying securities.
For investments in collective trust funds, the fair value of underlying securities reflect the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement
date. As such, these assets are valued using Level 2 inputs.

Level 3

—Fixed income securities are debt securities that do not have actively traded quotes as of the financial
statement date. Determining the fair value of these securities requires the use of unobservable inputs, such as indicative quotes from dealers, extrapolated data, proprietary models and qualitative
input from investment advisors. As such, these securities are classified within Level 3. Level 3 assets also include certain stocks that are not traded on a nationally recognized
securities exchange and insurance contracts valued using proprietary models.

10. Long-term Customer Financing and Sales of Receivables

Long-term Customer Financing

Long-term receivables consist of trade receivables with payment terms greater than twelve months, long-term
loans and lease receivables under sales-type leases. Long-term receivables consist of the following:

$


$


The current portion of long-term receivables is included in Accounts receivable and the non-current portion of long-term receivables
is included in Other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest income recognized on long-term receivables for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
was $2 million, $3 million and $7 million, respectively.

Certain
purchasers of the Company's infrastructure equipment may request that the Company provide long-term financing (defined as financing with terms greater than one year)
in connection with the sale of equipment. These requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment. The Company's obligation to provide long-term financing may be
conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to
purchase the long-term receivables from the Company. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $406 million at
December 31, 2009, compared to $370 million at December 31, 2008. Of these amounts, $13 million was supported by letters of credit or by bank commitments to purchase
long-term receivables at December 31, 2009, compared to $266 supported at December 31, 2008. The majority of the outstanding commitments at December 31, 2009 are to a
small number of network operators in the Middle East region. In response to the recent tightening in the credit markets, certain customers of the Company have requested financing in connection with
equipment purchases, and these types of requests have increased in volume and scope.

In
addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment customers, the Company also assists customers in obtaining financing directly from banks and other sources to fund
equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling $31 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $43 million at
December 31, 2008 (including $27 million and $23 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables). Customer
financing guarantees outstanding were $4 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $6 million at December 31, 2008 (including



$2 million
and $4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables).

Sales of Receivables

From time to time, the Company sells accounts receivable and long-term receivables in transactions that qualify as
"true-sales." Certain of these accounts receivable and long-term receivables are sold to third parties on a one-time, non-recourse basis, while others
are sold to third parties under committed facilities that involve contractual commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be renewed annually. The Company may or may not retain the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and long-term
receivables.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company had $200 million of committed revolving facilities for the sale of accounts receivable, of which $60 million was utilized. At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $532 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, of committed revolving facilities for the sale of accounts receivable, of which $497 and
$817 million, respectively, were utilized. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, the Company had $435 million of committed facilities associated with the sale of
long-term financing receivables primarily for a single customer, of which $262 million was utilized. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no significant committed facilities
for the sale of long-term receivables. During the first quarter of 2009, a $400 million committed accounts receivable facility expired and was not renewed. During the second quarter
of 2009, a $132 million committed accounts receivable facility was terminated. In June 2009, the Company initiated a new $200 million committed revolving domestic accounts receivable
facility.

In
2009, the Company made a strategic decision to significantly reduce its volume of accounts receivables sold.

Total
sales of accounts receivable and long-term receivables were $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 (including $1.2 billion of sales of
accounts receivable), compared to $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 (including $3.4 billion of sales of accounts receivable) and $4.9 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2007 (including $4.7 billion of sales of accounts receivable). At December 31, 2009, the Company retained servicing obligations for $195 million of sold
accounts receivables and $297 million of long-term receivables, compared to $621 million of accounts receivables and $400 million of long-term receivables
at December, 31, 2008.

Under
certain arrangements, the value of accounts receivable sold is covered by credit insurance purchased from third-party insurance companies, less deductibles or
self-insurance requirements under the insurance policies. The Company's total credit exposure, less insurance coverage, to outstanding accounts receivables that have been sold was
$27 million and $23 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal

Iridium Program:

The Company was named as one of several defendants in putative class action
securities lawsuits arising out of alleged misrepresentations or omissions regarding
the Iridium satellite communications business which, on March 15, 2001, were consolidated in the federal district court in the District of Columbia under

Freeland v.
Iridium World Communications, Inc., et al.,

originally filed on April 22, 1999. In April 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle, subject to court
approval, to settle all claims against Motorola in exchange for Motorola's payment of $20 million. During the three months ended March 29, 2008, the Company recorded a charge associated
with this settlement. On October 23, 2008, the court granted final approval of the settlement and dismissed the claims with prejudice.

The
Company was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured Creditors of Iridium (the "Committee") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
"Iridium Bankruptcy Court") on July 19, 2001.

In re Iridium Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

, plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of
contract, warranty and fiduciary duty and fraudulent transfer and preferences, and sought in excess of $4 billion in damages. On May 20, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement
in which Motorola is not required to pay anything, but released its administrative, priority and unsecured claims against the Iridium estate and withdrew its objection to the 2001 settlement between
the unsecured creditors of the Iridium Debtors and the Iridium Debtors' pre-petition secured lenders. This settlement, and its approval by the Bankruptcy Court,



extinguished
Motorola's financial exposure and concluded Motorola's involvement in the Iridium bankruptcy proceedings.

Telsim Class Action Securities:

In April 2007, the Company entered into a settlement agreement in regards to

In re Motorola Securities Litigation

,
a class action lawsuit relating to the Company's disclosure of its relationship with Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. Pursuant to the settlement, Motorola paid $190 million to the
class and all claims against Motorola by the class have been dismissed and released.

During
the three months ended March 31, 2007, the Company recorded a charge of $190 million for the legal settlement, partially offset by $75 million of estimated
insurance recoveries, of which $50 million had been tendered by certain insurance carriers. During the three months ended June 30, 2007, the Company commenced actions against the
non-tendering insurance carriers. In response to these actions, each insurance carrier who has responded denied coverage citing various policy provisions. As a result of this denial of
coverage and related actions, the Company recorded a reserve of $25 million in the three months ended June 30, 2007 against the receivable from insurance carriers. During the three
months ended September 27, 2008, the Company received the $50 million tendered by the insurance carriers. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company received a
net $43 million tendered by other insurance carriers.

Other:

The Company is a defendant in various other suits, claims and investigations that arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Other

Leases:

The Company owns most of its major facilities and leases certain office, factory and
warehouse space, land, and information technology and other equipment under
principally non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense, net of sublease income, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $153 million,
$181 million, and $231 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, future minimum lease obligations, net of minimum sublease rentals, for the next five years and beyond are as
follows: 2010—$208 million; 2011—$161 million; 2012—$109 million; 2013—$59 million; 2014—$38 million;
beyond—$93 million.

Indemnifications:

The Company is also a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to indemnify the
other party with respect to certain matters. Some of
these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of the Company's assets or businesses and require the Company to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from the settlement of these
pending obligations. The total amount of indemnification under these types of provisions is $141 million, of which the Company accrued $53 million as of December 31, 2009 for
potential claims under these provisions.

In
addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property.
Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements. However, there is an increasing risk in relation to patent indemnities given the current legal climate.

In
indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures
typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. Further, the Company's obligations under these agreements for indemnification based on breach of representations and warranties are
generally limited in terms of duration, and for amounts not in excess of the contract value, and, in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by
the Company.

Other:

During the three months ended September 27, 2008, the Company recorded a $150 million charge related to the
settlement of a purchase commitment.
During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded a $277 million charge for a legal settlement.

13. Reorganization of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"), which permits the Company to offer eligible employees severance
benefits based on years of service and employment grade level in



the
event that employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of a reduction-in-force or restructuring. Effective August 1, 2009, the Company amended and restated
the Severance Plan. Under the amended Severance Plan, severance benefits will be paid in bi-weekly installments to impacted employees rather than in lump sum payments. The Company
recognizes termination benefits based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on estimates prepared at the time
a restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations. At each reporting date, the Company
evaluates its accruals for employee separation and exit costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying
out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original
plans were initiated. In these cases, the Company reverses accruals through the consolidated statements of operations where the original charges were recorded when it is determined they are no longer
needed.

2009 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2009, in light of the macroeconomic decline that adversely affected sales, the Company
continued to implement various productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. All three of the
Company's business segments, as well as corporate functions, are impacted by these plans, with the majority of the impact in the Mobile Devices segment. The employees affected are located in all
geographic regions.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $336 million, including $78 million of charges in Costs of

14. Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company accounts for acquisitions using purchase accounting with the results of operations for each acquiree included in the Company's
consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on the Company's consolidated financial statements were not
significant individually nor in the aggregate.

The
allocation of value to in-process research and development was determined using expected future cash flows discounted at average risk adjusted rates reflecting both
technological and market risk as well as the time value of money. Historical pricing, margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used in the valuation of the in-process products.
The in-process research and development acquired will have no alternative future uses if the products are not feasible.

The
developmental products for the companies acquired have varying degrees of timing, technology, costs-to-complete and market risks throughout final development.
If the products fail to become viable, the Company will unlikely be able to realize any value from the sale of incomplete technology to another party or through internal re-use. The risks
of market acceptance for the products under development and potential reductions in projected sales volumes and related profits in the event of delayed market availability for any of the products
exist. Efforts to complete all developmental products continue and there are no known delays to forecasted plans except as disclosed.

The
Company did not have any significant acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The following is a summary of significant acquisitions during the year

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company finalized its assessment of the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 Limitations ("IRC
Section 382") relating to the pre-acquisition tax loss carry-forwards of its 2007 acquisitions. As a result of the IRC Section 382 studies, the Company recorded additional
deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in goodwill, which is reflected in the adjustment row above.

The
Company conducts its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A
reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company has determined that the Mobile Devices segment meets the requirement of a reporting unit. For the Enterprise
Mobility Solutions segment, the Company has identified two reporting units, the Government and Public Safety reporting unit and the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit. For the Home and Networks
Mobility segment, the Company has identified two reporting units, the Home reporting unit and the Networks reporting unit. The Company performs extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and
market-based approaches, in its goodwill assessment process. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and other assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires us to make
significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rate, earnings before depreciation and
amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts specific to each reporting unit. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.

The
Company has weighted the valuation of its reporting units at 75% based on the income approach and 25% based on the market-based approach, consistent with prior periods. The Company
believes that this weighting is appropriate since it is often difficult to find other appropriate market participants that are similar to our reporting units and it is the Company's view that future
discounted cash flows are more reflective of the value of the reporting units.

With
respect to the primary assumptions made in determining the fair value of its reporting units, for the Home, Networks, Government and Public Safety and Enterprise Mobility reporting
units, the Company assigned discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 13.5% in 2009 and 13.0% to 14.0% in 2008. The Company assigned a discount rate of 17.5% to the Mobile Devices reporting unit in 2009
and, commensurate with development stage enterprises or turnaround opportunities, 25% in 2008. The Company believes this rate reflects the inherent uncertainties of the Mobile Devices reporting unit's
projected cash flows. The Company evaluated the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units, as well as the
fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units, and concluded they are reasonable.

Based
on the results of our 2009 annual assessments of the recoverability goodwill, the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their book values, indicating that there was no
impairment of goodwill.

Following
is a discussion of the goodwill impairment charges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company experienced a sustained, significant decline in its stock price that reduced the market capitalization below the book value of the Company.
The reduced market capitalization reflected the macroeconomic declines coupled with the market view on the performance of the Mobile Devices reporting unit. The Company considered this decline in its
stock price in the impairment assessment.

Based
on the results of Step One of the 2008 annual assessment of the recoverability goodwill, the fair values of the Home, Networks and Government and Public Safety reporting units
exceeded their book value, indicating that there was no impairment of goodwill at these reporting units.

However,
the fair values of the Enterprise Mobility and Mobile Devices reporting units were below their respective book values, indicating a potential impairment of goodwill and the
requirement to perform Step Two of the analysis for these reporting units. The Company acquired the main components of the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit in 2007 at which time the book value and
fair value of the reporting unit was the same. Because of this fact, the Enterprise Mobility reporting unit was most likely to experience a decline in its fair value below its book value as a result
of lower values in the overall market and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and the market's view of its near term impact on the reporting unit. The decline in the fair value of the Mobile
Devices reporting unit below its book value was a result of the deteriorating macroeconomic environment, lower than expected sales and cash flows as a result of the decision to consolidate platforms
announced in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the uncertainty around the reporting unit's future cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company determined that the goodwill
relating to the Enterprise Mobility and Mobile



Devices
reporting units was impaired, resulting in charges of $1.6 billion and $55 million, respectively in the Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Mobile Devices reportable segments.

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officers and chief financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on this
evaluation, our chief executive officers and chief financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating
to Motorola, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Motorola's management, including our chief executive officers and chief financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Motorola's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term
is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officers and chief
financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, using the criteria set forth in the

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2009. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued a
report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears in this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We
have audited Motorola, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Motorola, Inc.'s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Motorola, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 16, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
