Business Segments

Motorola reports six segments as described below.

Personal Communications Segment

The Personal Communications segment (“PCS” or the
“segment”) designs, manufactures, sells and services
wireless handsets with integrated software and accessory
products. In 2004, PCS net sales represented 54% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

Our wireless subscriber products include wireless handsets, with
related software and accessory products. We market our products
worldwide to carriers and consumers through direct sales,
distributors, dealers, retailers and, in certain markets,
through licensees.

Our Industry

We believe that total industry shipments of wireless handsets
(also referred to as industry “sell-in”) increased in
2004 by approximately 25% compared to 2003. Demand from new
subscribers was strong in emerging markets, including China,
Latin America and Eastern Europe. Replacement sales in
highly-penetrated markets were also strong due to generally
improved economic conditions and compelling new phone designs
and attractive features, such as cameras, large color displays,
expanded software applications, advanced messaging
functionality, advanced gaming features and an increased
opportunity for personalization.

In this environment, we were able to grow faster than the market
and increase our overall market share. The industry forecasters
predict that the wireless handset industry will continue to grow
over the next several years as the transition to next-generation
data-rich services, such as point-to-point video and higher
speed data, continues.

Our Strategy

PCS is focused on profitable and sustainable growth through
close partnerships with our carrier customers, technology
leadership and improving cost competitiveness. We are investing
in the development of industry-leading GSM, CDMA, iDEN®,
and 3G UMTS products, with an emphasis on winning greater market
share through compelling designs, more feature-rich handsets,
including handsets with large color displays and cameras, and
on-time delivery of products to our customers.

We are focused on enhanced partnerships with our customers by
aligning with their business strategies and objectives. A core
component of our customer partnership strategy is the expansion
of opportunities for carrier customers to increase average
revenue per user (ARPU). By utilizing customizable platforms, we
enable our carrier customers to go to market with handsets that
feature differentiated user interfaces, such as consumer
personalization, to help them build consumer loyalty. These
platforms also generate revenue opportunities for our carrier
customers by supporting data productivity applications, gaming,
music and other entertainment offerings and customized content.

During 2004, we continued to build on our technology leadership
with the launch of 60 new products, resulting in a strong,
well-balanced portfolio across regions, technologies, price
tiers and form factors. The new portfolio includes iconic models
such as the RAZR V3 and the StarTac Classic; the continued
delivery of 3G UMTS handsets; the introduction of
EDGE-enabled GSM handsets; and products using Open Source
technologies such as Linux and
Java

tm

,
as well as products featuring the Microsoft Windows
Mobile

tm

operating system. We believe we have the most comprehensive and
proven line-up of 3G UMTS handsets in the industry. We
introduced many products based on our platform design strategy
that leverages design effectiveness and supply chain operations,
improving product quality and time to market. Many of our
products feature Bluetooth® technology to support advanced
wireless functions, including wireless headsets. For handsets
using iDEN technology, we

Note: When discussing the net sales for each of our six
segments, we express the segment’s net sales as a
percentage of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Because
certain of our segments sell products to other Motorola
businesses, $963 million of intracompany sales were
eliminated as part of the consolidation process in 2004. As a
result, the percentages of consolidated net sales for each of
our business segments sum to greater than 100% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales.



introduced the first product with an integrated camera,
increased our portfolio of GPS-enabled handsets and expanded the
portfolio of handsets targeted specifically at the prepaid
market.

As part of our efforts to improve our brand, we are developing
youth-driven brand partnerships that will support a
consumer-centric design philosophy and further reinforce the
brand strength generated by our

MOTO

marketing
activities. Additionally, PCS product offerings have played a
key role in reinvigorating the Motorola brand among consumers
worldwide, which we expect will help fuel demand for new
products and experiences during 2005 and beyond.

The success of our strategy is evidenced by our continued market
leadership in several key markets and significant sales growth
for the full year 2004 compared to the full year 2003. We
attribute this success to our strong replacement sales in
developed markets and sales to new subscribers in developing
countries.

Customers

The PCS customer partnership strategy continues to focus on
strengthening relationships with our top customers. PCS has
several large customers, worldwide, the loss of one or more of
which could have a negative impact on our results. In 2004,
purchases of iDEN® products by Nextel Communications, Inc.
(“Nextel”) and its affiliates comprised approximately
14% of our segment’s net sales. In addition to Nextel, the
largest of our end customers include Cingular, China Mobile and
Vodafone. Besides selling directly to carriers and operators,
PCS also sells products through a variety of third-party
distributors and retailers, which account for approximately 30%
of the segment’s net sales. The largest of these
represented approximately 5% of the segment’s net sales in
2004 and is our primary distributor in Latin America.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
60% of our net sales, are outside the U.S. The largest of these
international markets are China, the United Kingdom and Brazil.
Compared to 2003, the segment saw substantial sales growth in
all regions of the world as a result of an improved product
portfolio, strong market growth in the emerging markets, and
high replacement sales in the more mature markets.

In North America, the industry saw consolidation of some major
carriers, including some of the segment’s largest
customers. The segment did not see any significant impact on its
business in 2004 as a result of these consolidations, nor do we
foresee any significant impact from these consolidations in the
future.

Nextel is our largest customer and we have been their sole
supplier of iDEN handsets and core network infrastructure
equipment for over ten years. Nextel uses Motorola’s
proprietary iDEN technology to support its nationwide wireless
service business. In December 2004, Motorola announced that it
reached an agreement with Nextel to extend the companies’
iDEN infrastructure and iDEN subscriber supply agreements for a
period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007.
Motorola also announced an agreement with Nextel for
implementation of Next Generation Dispatch, a new Internet
Protocol-based call processing engine designed to replace the
current call-processing system. In addition, Motorola has
developed a new 6:1 vocoder which will allow Nextel to increase
capacity on its current system. Nextel has announced its
intention to activate the 6:1 vocoder in substantially all of
its markets in 2005. In December 2004, Nextel and Sprint Corp.
(“Sprint”) announced an intended merger of their
companies. The segment does not anticipate any significant
impact to its business in 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result
of this merger.

Competition

The segment believes it increased overall market share in 2004
and solidified its hold on the second-largest worldwide market
share of wireless handsets. The segment experiences intense
competition in worldwide markets from numerous global
competitors, including some of the world’s largest
companies. The segment’s primary competitors are European
and Asian manufacturers. Currently, its largest competitors
include Nokia, Samsung, LG, Siemens and Sony Ericsson.

We believe the ability to differentiate our products and provide
additional value to our customers will be increasingly realized,
primarily through the continued introduction of unique and
compelling product designs, the addition of new features to
enhance our products and through consumer experiences. These
consumer experiences will be shaped by the user interface and
software applications that can be delivered on handsets at point
of purchase and beyond. The segment utilizes
Java

tm

technology to better leverage the largest wireless developer
community in the world. The segment also uses the Microsoft
Windows
Mobile

tm

operating system for its MPx product line.



General competitive factors in the market for our products
include: time-to-market; brand awareness; technology offered;
price; product performance, features, design, quality, delivery
and warranty; the quality and availability of service; company
image and relationship with key customers.

Payment Terms

The segment’s customers and distributors buy from us
regularly with payment terms that are competitive with current
industry practices. These terms vary globally and range from
cash-with-order to 60 days. Payment terms allow the
customer or distributor to purchase products from us on a
periodic basis and pay for those products at the end of the
agreed term applicable to each purchase. A customer’s
outstanding credit at any point in time is limited to a
predetermined amount as established by management. Extended
payment terms beyond 60 days are provided to customers on a
case-by-case basis. Such extended terms are not related to a
significant portion of our revenues.

Regulatory Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and
personal communications industry may be affected if adequate
frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new
technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies
currently allocated for such use. Industry growth may also be
affected by the cost of the new licenses required to use
frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network
systems such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems such as
WiMax. Other countries also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow these and other new technologies,
which can be offered without spectrum license costs and may
introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
our customers.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. The 2004 backlog is believed to be
generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
recognized as revenue in 2005. The forward-looking estimates of
the firmness of such orders is subject to future events which
may cause the amount recognized to change. In 2004, the segment
had strong order growth but backlog decreased as a result of the
segment’s improved ability to meet demand for new products
in a more timely manner. Backlog at the end of 2003 was above
normal due to a key component supply constraint which resulted
in the segment’s inability to meet the demand for certain
new products in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing
processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third
parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Motorola is
also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty
and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
subject to licenses. The protection of these licenses is also
important to the segment’s operations. Reference is made to
the material under the heading “Other Information” for
information relating to patents and trademarks and research and
development activities with respect to this segment.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

PCS’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory
in distribution centers in order to meet customer delivery
requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards. At
the end of 2004, the segment had a slightly higher inventory
balance than at the end of 2003. The increased inventory is to
support anticipated higher first quarter 2005 sales compared to
the first quarter of 2004. We also made certain strategic
purchases of critical components to support the anticipated
sales.



Where economically and technically feasible, materials used in
the segment’s operations are generally second-sourced to
ensure a continuity of supply. Occasionally, shortages or
extended delivery periods occur for various component parts, the
effects of which are generally short in duration.

Energy necessary for the segment’s manufacturing facilities
consists of electricity, natural gas and gasoline, all of which
are currently in generally adequate supply. The segment’s
facilities contain automation and, therefore, require a reliable
source of electrical power. Labor is generally available in
reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing
facilities. Difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned
items could affect the segment’s results.

The segment permits returns under certain circumstances,
generally pursuant to warranties which we consider to be
competitive with current industry practices.

The segment typically experiences increased sales in the fourth
calendar quarter and lower sales in the first calendar quarter
of each year. Sales of wireless handsets and related products
increase during the year-end holiday season.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Libertyville, Illinois. Our
major facilities are located in Libertyville, Illinois;
Plantation, Florida; Flensburg, Germany; Tianjin, China;
Singapore; Jaguariuna, Brazil; and Seoul, Korea. We also
maintain interests in joint ventures in Hangzhou, China.
Additional engineering, software development and administration
offices are located in San Diego and Sunnyvale, California;
South Plainfield, New Jersey; Champaign, Illinois;
Fort Worth, Texas; Boynton Beach, Florida; Basingstoke,
England; Toulouse, France; Torino, Italy; Taipei, Taiwan; and
Beijing, China. As planned, certain manufacturing was ceased in
Flensburg, Germany during the first quarter of 2004 and the
Boynton Beach, Florida facility was vacated in 2004.

We also use several electronics manufacturing suppliers
(EMS) and original design-manufacturers (ODM) to
enhance our ability to lower our costs and deliver products that
meet consumer demands in the rapidly-changing technological
environment.

In 2004, our handsets were primarily manufactured in Asia,
including products manufactured for us by third parties. We
expect this trend to continue in 2005. Our largest manufacturing
facilities are located in China, Singapore, Brazil, Malaysia and
Korea. Each of these facilities serves multiple countries and
regions of the world. In 2004, approximately one-third of our
handsets were manufactured by third parties, who primarily
manufacture in Asia. In 2005, this percentage is expected to
remain consistent.

Global Telecom Solutions Segment

The Global Telecom Solutions segment (“GTSS” or the
“segment”) designs, manufactures, sells, installs and
services wireless infrastructure communication systems,
including hardware and software. In 2004, GTSS net sales
represented 17% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

GTSS provides end-to-end wireless networks, including radio base
stations, base site controllers, associated software and
services, mobility soft switching, application platforms and
third-party switching for CDMA, GSM, iDEN® and UMTS
technologies. GTSS products are marketed to wireless service
providers worldwide through a direct sales force, licensees and
agents.

Our Industry

The wireless infrastructure industry experienced significant
growth in 2004 after three years of decline. The segment
believes that its 24% increase in net sales outpaced overall
sales growth in the industry, and resulted in increased market
share for the segment in 2004.

The industry’s migration to 3G systems, which are
high-capacity wireless networks designed to provide enhanced
data services, improved Internet access and increased voice
capacity, is currently focused primarily on two
technologies—CDMA2000 1X and UMTS. GTSS is a supplier
for both of these technologies. CDMA markets have begun to
deploy CDMA2000 1X-EVDO technology, which provides increased
data bandwidth compared to



CDMA2000 1X. In addition, many GSM markets, particularly
those in Western Europe, have begun to deploy UMTS.

Our Strategy

We are executing on a strategy to enhance our position as an
end-to-end supplier of wireless infrastructure. GTSS continues
to invest in major radio access technologies: CDMA2000 1X,
CDMA2000 1X-EVDO, iDEN®, GSM, GPRS (General Packet
Radio Service, which is a 2.5G technology), EDGE (a technology
that provides data bandwidth higher than GPRS in existing GSM
spectrum assignments), UMTS and HSDPA (High Speed Downlink
Packet Access, an evolution from UMTS technology that offers
improved performance benefits and reduced costs to operators).
In 2004, GTSS deployed its soft switch product in certain
markets in Asia and Latin America. The market for wireless soft
switch continues to grow, and we believe GTSS is a leader in
providing these next-generation wireless soft switch
IP networks.

Our network products are further enhanced by a portfolio of
services that reduce operator capital expenditure requirements,
increase network capacity and improve system quality. These
quality improvements benefit operators through increased
customer satisfaction, greater usage and lower churn, all of
which can have a positive impact on operator financial results.
GTSS also expanded its market presence in emerging markets, many
of which have higher subscriber growth rates than those in
mature markets.

We also continue to build on our industry-leading position in
push-to-talk over cellular (PoC) technology. We have executed
agreements to launch our PoC product application on both GPRS
and CDMA2000 1X networks. To date, the segment has
23 contracts in 27 countries.

Customers

Due to the nature of the segment’s business, the agreements
it enters into are primarily long-term contracts with major
operators that require sizeable investments by customers. In
2004, five customers represented approximately 54% of the
segment’s net sales (China Mobile; China Unicom; KDDI, a
service provider in Japan; Nextel and its affiliates; and
Verizon). The loss of any of the segment’s large customers,
in particular these customers, could have a material adverse
effect on the segment’s business. Further, because
contracts are long-term, the loss of a major customer would
impact revenue and earnings over several quarters.

Nextel is our largest customer, representing 17% of the
segment’s net sales in 2004, and we have been their sole
supplier of iDEN handsets and core network infrastructure
equipment for over ten years. Nextel uses Motorola’s
proprietary iDEN technology to support its nationwide wireless
service business. In December 2004, Motorola announced that it
reached an agreement with Nextel to extend the companies’
iDEN infrastructure and iDEN subscriber supply agreements for a
period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007.
Motorola also announced an agreement with Nextel for
implementation of Next Generation Dispatch, a new Internet
Protocol-based call processing engine designed to replace the
current call-processing system. In addition, Motorola has
developed a new 6:1 vocoder which will allow Nextel to increase
capacity on its current system. Nextel has announced its
intention to activate the 6:1 vocoder in substantially all of
its markets in 2005. In December 2004, Nextel and Sprint
announced an intended merger of their companies. The segment
does not anticipate any significant impact to its business in
2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of this merger.

KDDI has been successful with its all-Motorola 800MHZ CDMA2000
1X network in Japan. In 2004, Motorola and KDDI began deployment
of a CDMA2000 1X network in the 2GHZ band. This new packet-based
2GHz network is expected to allow KDDI to provide more advanced
features and expand its subscriber base.

Competition

GTSS experiences competition in worldwide markets from numerous
competitors, ranging in size from some of the world’s
largest companies to small, specialized firms. Ericsson has
maintained its market leadership position. Five vendors with
similar market share positions including Motorola, Nokia,
Siemens, Lucent and Nortel trail Ericsson. Alcatel, Samsung and
NEC are also significant competitors. Competition will continue
to intensify as new Chinese infrastructure vendors like Huawei
and ZTE enter the market.



We have experienced significant competition in the markets for
our products and services, especially as the industry
transitions to 3G technologies. GTSS is a supplier of
3G equipment for both CDMA2000 1X and UMTS
technologies, although we have a much stronger position in
CDMA2000 1X.

Competitive factors in the market for the segment’s
products include: technology offered; price; payment terms;
availability of vendor financing; product and system
performance; product features, quality, delivery, availability
and warranty; the quality and availability of service; company
image; relationship with key customers; and time-to-market.
Price is a major area of competition and often impacts margins
for initial system bids, particularly in emerging markets.
Time-to-market has also been an important competitive factor,
especially for new systems and technologies.

Payment Terms

GTSS contracts typically include implementation milestones, such
as delivery, installation and system acceptance. Generally,
these milestones can take anywhere from 30 to 180 days to
complete. Customer payments are typically tied to the completion
of these milestones. Once a milestone is reached, payment terms
are generally 30 to 60 days. As required for competitive
reasons, we may arrange or provide for extended payment terms or
long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases. We
directly provided long-term financing of approximately
$23 million to one customer in 2004; approximately
$16 million to two customers in 2003; and approximately
$47 million to four customers in 2002.

Regulatory Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and
personal communications industry may be affected if adequate
frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new
technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies
currently allocated for such use. Industry growth may also be
affected by the cost of the new licenses required to use
frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network
systems such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems such as
WiMax. Other countries also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow these and other new technologies,
which can be offered without spectrum license costs and may
introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
our customers.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $1.6 billion at
December 31, 2003. The 2004 order backlog is believed to be
generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
recognized as revenue during 2005. The forward-looking estimates
of the firmness of such orders are subject to future events that
may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
relating to its products, systems, technologies, and
manufacturing processes. The segment licenses certain of its
patents to third parties and generates modest revenue from these
licenses. Motorola is also licensed to use certain patents owned
by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and
are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of
the products subject to licenses. The protection of these
licenses is also important to the segment’s operations.
Reference is made to the material under the heading “Other
Information” for information relating to patents and
trademarks and research and development activities with respect
to this segment.



Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a
manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2004,
the segment had a 26% increase in inventory as compared to the
end of 2003, primarily due to expected increased sales volumes
in 2005.

Where economically and technically feasible, materials used in
the segment’s operations are generally second-sourced to
ensure a continuity of supply. Occasionally, shortages or
extended delivery periods occur for various component parts, the
effects of which are generally short in duration.

Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are
primary sources of energy for the segment’s operations.
Current supplies of these forms of energy are generally
considered to be adequate for this segment’s operations in
both U.S. and non-U.S. locations. Labor is generally available
in reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing
facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of these
items could affect the segment’s results.

Generally the segment’s contracts do not include a right of
return other than for standard warranty provisions. For new
product introductions, we may enter into milestone contracts
wherein if we do not achieve the milestones, the product could
be returned.

Our business does not have seasonal patterns for sales.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Arlington Heights, Illinois.
Major design centers include Arlington Heights and Schaumburg,
Illinois; Chandler, Arizona; Fort Worth, Texas; Tewksbury,
Massachusetts; Cork, Ireland; Bangalore, India; and Swindon,
U.K. We operate manufacturing facilities in Schaumburg,
Illinois; Fort Worth, Texas; Hangzhou and Tianjin, China;
Swindon, U.K.; and Jaguariuna, Brazil. A majority of our
manufacturing is conducted in China, with nearly 100% of printed
circuit board assembly for the segment performed by outsourcers
in China.

Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions
Segment

The Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions segment
(“CGISS” or the “segment”) provides
customized and commercial off-the-shelf, mission-critical
integrated communications and information systems. In 2004,
CGISS net sales represented 15% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

CGISS designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services analog
and digital two-way radio, voice and data communications
products and systems to a wide range of public-safety,
government, utility, courier, transportation and other worldwide
markets. The business continues to invest in the market for
broadband data, including infrastructure, devices, service and
applications. In addition, the segment participates in the
expanding market for integrated information management, mobile
and biometric applications and services. These applications and
services provide our customers with computer-aided dispatch,
field based reporting, records management and fingerprint
matching capabilities.

Our products are sold directly through our own distribution
force or through independent authorized distributors and
dealers, commercial mobile radio service operators and
independent commission sales representatives. Our distribution
organization provides systems engineering and installation and
other technical and systems management services to meet our
customers’ particular needs. The customer may also choose
to install and maintain the equipment with its own employees, or
may obtain installation, service and parts from a network of our
authorized service stations (most of whom are also authorized
dealers) or from other non-Motorola service stations.

Our Industry

Significant events since 2001 have heightened the need for
safety and security products and systems worldwide.
Public-safety, government and enterprise organizations are
seeking a wide range of detection and prevention capabilities;
interoperable communications and information sharing across many
users; and integrated voice, data and video capabilities. We
have been a leader in providing mission-critical communications
and information



products and systems for more than 65 years, and our
business is well positioned to continue to benefit from
increased spending for safety and security products and systems.

Spending by the segment’s government and public safety
customers is affected by government budgets at the national,
state and local levels. In the U.S., where the majority of the
segment’s sales occur, the 2005 Department of Homeland
Security Appropriations Act was passed in October 2004,
providing for an increase over 2004’s discretionary
spending budget. However, it is very difficult to tell how much
of that funding will be used for communications needs. Also,
recent U.S. federal government budget proposals have indicated
potential funding reductions to state and local agencies that
purchase our products and systems. In addition, even in light of
limited budgets for local governments and public safety
agencies, the segment sees increased prioritization of limited
government funds towards funding of safety and security
projects. Particularly, customers in the government market are
interested in two-way radio systems and integrated solutions
that enhance interoperability and compatibility. Accordingly,
the segment does not expect reductions in U.S. federal
government funding to state and local agencies to have a
material impact on its business in 2005. The segment will
continue to work closely with all pertinent government
departments and agencies to ensure that two-way radio and
wireless communications is positioned as a critical need for
homeland security.

The scope and size of systems requested by some of our customers
are increasing, including requests for countrywide and statewide
systems. These larger systems are more complex and include a
wide range of capabilities. Larger system projects will impact
how contracts are bid, which companies compete for bids and how
companies partner on projects. In 2004, we were awarded several
larger system projects, including projects for the
U.S. Postal Service, the Austrian Ministry of Interior and
the Commonwealth of Virginia. The scope of these and related
projects vary, however, they are: (i) generally longer term
arrangements, up to 25 years, (ii) cover a wider
geography or a larger user group, and (iii) include the
sale of infrastructure, systems integration, subscriber products
and/or managed services. In 2005, we expect the trend towards
larger systems to continue.

Our Strategy

Key elements in our strategy include: (i) providing
integrated voice, data and broadband over wireless systems at
the local, state and national government levels globally;
(ii) continued migration from analog to digital end-to-end
radio systems; (iii) providing Project 25 and TETRA
standards-based voice and data networking systems around the
world; (iv) the implementation of interoperable
communications and information systems, especially related to
global homeland security; and (v) increasing sales to enterprise
customers. We are working with national governments to design
and sell countrywide radio systems that are shared by police,
fire, emergency services and, in some cases, military agencies.
We are also providing essential integrated software
applications. These applications, which have been the result of
internal development and acquisitions, enhance our
customer’s business processes, enabling them to fulfill
their missions in public safety, criminal justice and public
service. Our product lines include computer-aided dispatch,
records management systems, criminal and civil automated
fingerprint identification systems, mobile data applications and
devices, corrections management systems, and customer service
request systems, as well as other related products.

Customers

The principal customers for two-way radio products and systems
include: public-safety agencies, such as police, fire, emergency
management services and military; petroleum companies; gas,
electric and water utilities; courier companies; telephone
companies; diverse industrial companies; transportation
companies, such as railroads, airlines, taxicab operations and
trucking firms; institutions, such as schools and hospitals; and
companies in construction, manufacturing and service businesses.
We sell our products to various local, state, provincial and
national agencies for many uses, including homeland security.
Net sales to customers in North America accounted for 66% of the
segment’s net sales in 2004.

We have a large number of customers worldwide. The combined net
sales from our top 5 customers worldwide represent about
11% of 2004 segment net sales. A loss or reduction in purchasing
levels by a single customer or a few customers could, but is not
likely to, have a material adverse effect on our financial
results.

Competition

We are a leading worldwide supplier of two-way radio
communications products, services and systems. We provide
communications and information systems compliant with both
existing industry digital standards, TETRA



and Project 25. We experience widespread, intense
competition from numerous competitors ranging from some of the
world’s largest diversified companies to foreign,
state-owned telecommunications companies to many small,
specialized firms. Many competitors have their principal
manufacturing operations located outside the U.S., which may
serve to reduce their manufacturing costs and enhance their
brand recognition in their locale. Major competitors include: M/
A-Com (Tyco), Nokia, Kenwood, E.F. Johnson, EADS
Telecommunications and large system integrators.

We may also act as a subcontractor to large system integrators
based on a number of competitive factors

and customer requirements. As demand for fully-integrated
voice, data and broadband over wireless systems

at the local, state and national government levels continues,
we may face additional competition from public
telecommunications carriers.

Competitive factors for our products and systems include: price;
technology offered and standards compliance; product features,
performance, quality, availability, delivery and support; and
the quality and availability of support services and systems
engineering, with no one factor being dominant. An additional
factor is the availability of vendor financing, as customers
continue to look to equipment vendors as an additional source of
financing.

Payment Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide. Generally, contract payment terms
range from net 30 to 60 days. As required for competitive
reasons, we may provide or arrange for long-term financing in
connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or
a portion of the purchase price.

Regulatory Matters

Users of two-way radio communications are regulated by a variety
of governmental and other regulatory agencies throughout the
world. In the U.S., users of two-way radios are licensed by the
FCC, which has broad authority to make rules and regulations and
prescribe restrictions and conditions to carry out the
provisions of the Communications Act of 1934. Regulatory
agencies in other countries have similar types of authority.
Consequently, the business and results of this segment could be
affected by the rules and regulations adopted by the FCC or
regulatory agencies in other countries from time to time.
Motorola has developed products using trunking and data
communications technologies to enhance spectral efficiencies.
The growth and results of the two-way radio communications
industry may be affected by the regulations of the FCC or other
regulatory agencies relating to access to allocated frequencies
for land mobile communications users, especially in urban areas
where such frequencies are heavily used.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network
systems such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems such as
WiMax. Other countries also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow these and other technologies, which
can be offered without spectrum license costs and may introduce
new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and our
customers.

On February 7, 2005, Nextel Communications agreed to a plan
by federal regulators designed to address interference from
Nextel cellular phones with hundreds of public safety
communications systems in the U.S. According to the FCC, the
agreement should dramatically reduce the likelihood of
interference. Nextel will be required to fund certain costs
necessary to relocate those impacted users into the 800MHz
spectrum. CGISS will continue to work with our customers that
are impacted by this plan and expects that this will have an
overall positive impact on the CGISS business over the next
several years. However, the impact in the short term is
uncertain and yet to be quantified, as all of the details of the
plan are not finalized.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $1.7 billion as of
December 31, 2003. The 2004 backlog amount is believed to
be generally firm, and approximately 66% of that amount is
expected to be recognized as revenue during 2005. This
forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is
subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to
change.



Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is very important to the segment’s
business. We actively participate in the development of open
standards for interoperable, mission critical digital two-way
radio systems. We have published our technology and licensed
patents to signatories of the industry’s two primary
memorandums of understanding defined by the Telecommunications
Industry Association (TIA) Project 25 and European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Terrestrial
Trunked Radio (TETRA). Royalties associated with these licenses
are not expected to be material to the segment’s financial
results. Reference is made to the material under the heading
“Other Information” for information relating to
patents and trademarks, and research and development activities
with respect to this segment.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment provides custom products based on assembling basic
units into a large variety of models or combinations. This
requires the stocking of inventories and large varieties of
piece parts and replacement parts, as well as a variety of basic
level assemblies in order to meet delivery requirements.
Relatively short delivery requirements and historical trends
determine the amounts of inventory to be stocked. To the extent
suppliers’ product life cycles are shorter than the
segment’s, stocking of lifetime buy inventories is
required. In addition, replacement parts are stocked for
delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle,
including radios that have been canceled within the last
10 years.

Availability of the materials and components required by the
segment is relatively dependable, but normal fluctuations in
market demand and supply could cause temporary, selective
shortages and affect results. Direct sourcing of materials and
components from foreign suppliers is becoming more extensive. We
operate certain offshore manufacturing plants, the loss of one
or more of which could constrain our production capabilities and
affect the segment’s financial results. We currently source
certain raw materials from single vendors. Any material
disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material
adverse impact on our operations.

Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
primary sources of energy for the segment’s operations.
Current supplies of these forms of energy are generally
considered to be adequate for this segment’s operations.
Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the
segment’s manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties
in obtaining any of these items could affect the segment’s
results.

Generally, we do not permit customers to return products. We
typically have stronger sales in the fourth quarter of the year
because of government and commercial spending patterns, as well
as the timing of new product releases.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Schaumburg, Illinois, and our
major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in
Elgin and Schaumburg, Illinois; Tianjin, China; Penang,
Malaysia; Berlin and Taunusstein, Germany; and Arad, Israel. The
majority of our products are integrated/manufactured in
Schaumburg, Illinois; Berlin, Germany; and Penang, Malaysia.

Integrated Electronic Systems Segment

The Integrated Electronic Systems segment (“IESS” or
the “segment”) designs, manufactures and sells:
(i) automotive and industrial electronics systems,
(ii) telematics systems that enable automated roadside
assistance, navigation and advanced safety features for
automobiles, (iii) portable energy storage products and
systems, and (iv) embedded computing systems. In 2004, IESS
net sales represented 9% of the Company’s consolidated net
sales.

Principal Products and Services

The Automotive Communications and Electronic Systems Group
(“ACES”) consists of three businesses: the Powertrain
Chassis and Systems Group (“PCSG”), the Interior
Electronics Division (“IED”), and the Telematics
Communications Group (“TCG”). PCSG and IED use
application and engineering expertise to design and sell custom
electronic systems for original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”), which may include foreign and domestic
automobile manufacturers, heavy vehicle manufacturers, farm
equipment manufacturers and industrial customers, as well as
first-tier suppliers to such manufacturers. TCG provides
automotive customers with embedded



telematics control units, integrated wireless handsets,
navigation and driver safety products and systems controls for
automotive vehicles.

The Energy Systems Group (“ESG”) delivers complete
portable energy storage products and systems for many of
today’s leading brand-name wireless handsets, handheld
computers and other portable electronic products. A significant
portion of ESG’s sales are to other businesses within
Motorola, including the wireless handset business, PCS, and the
public safety and enterprise communications business, CGISS.

The Embedded Communications Computing Group (“ECCG”),
formerly known as the Motorola Computer Group (“MCG”),
specializes in standards-based, embedded computing systems that
are integrated by OEMs into a wide variety of products in the
telecommunications, industrial automation, defense, medical and
aerospace industries. In August 2004, the Company acquired Force
Computers, a worldwide designer and supplier of open,
standards-based and custom embedded computing solutions. Force
Computers was integrated with MCG, and the two combined entities
were renamed the Embedded Communications Computing Group.

The segment markets its products through a direct sales force,
channel distributors and strategic distribution partners.

Our Industry

The segment participates in three industries. We provide:
(i) products and systems used in automotive vehicles,
(ii) portable energy systems, such as batteries used in
wireless devices, and (iii) embedded computing systems.
Demand for our products is linked to various factors, including
consumer demand for cars and wireless devices and industrial
demand for embedded computing systems.

In 2004, net sales were up for ACES due to new electronic
controls and telematics products. ESG net sales increased
primarily due to increased shipments of wireless handset devices
by PCS. ECCG net sales increased due to the Force Computers
acquisition and increased demand for commercial, off-the-shelf
embedded computing systems.

Our Strategy

The strategy of the businesses that make up the segment is to
accelerate growth by increasing share in existing markets and by
expanding into related market segments. ACES continues to grow
as automotive OEMs expand the electronic content in their
vehicle’s powertrain, chassis, sensor, interior electronics
and telematics systems. Going forward, the growth in the global
automotive electronics market is expected to outpace the growth
rate of global vehicle production. ACES is well positioned to
take advantage of this growth.

We expect ECCG to grow by leading the move to higher utilization
of standards-based embedded computing systems. Growth also is
expected as a result of the acquisition of Force Computers,
which we expect to enable ECCG to provide solutions for a wider
range of customer applications needs, supported by a broader
portfolio of boards, systems and services. These products enable
OEMs in telecommunications, industrial automation, defense and
aerospace industries to acquire commercial, off-the-shelf
computing systems instead of creating these systems with
in-house engineering resources. This change enables OEMs to
provide more cost-effective computing systems and to focus their
own research and development on applications that add value to
and differentiate the computing system.

ESG’s growth is tied to the volume of portable devices in
the mobile computing and portable communications markets.

Customers

In 2004, 60% of the segment’s net sales were to four
customers: 19% to Motorola, 17% to General Motors, 12% to Ford
and 12% to Daimler Chrysler. Our largest customer within
Motorola is the wireless handset business, PCS. The loss of a
significant portion of any of these customers’ business
could have a material adverse effect upon the segment.



Competition

Demand for the products of ACES is linked to automobile sales in
the U.S. and other countries and the level of electronic content
per vehicle. Demand for ESG products is strongly linked to the
sales of other Motorola businesses, particularly the sales of
our wireless handset business, the group’s largest
customer. Demand for ECCG products is linked to sales of
telecommunications, manufacturing, and other infrastructure
systems in the U.S. and other countries. The segment experiences
competition from numerous global competitors, including
automobile manufacturers’ affiliated electronic control
suppliers.

ACES is the leader for embedded telematics systems and products,
as well as a leader for pressure sensor products; key
competitors include Delphi and Visteon. ESG is one of the
largest providers of portable energy storage products and
systems; key competitors include Sony, Panasonic, and Sanyo.
ECCG is a leader in VME technology (the industry’s first
widely-adopted embedded computing standard) and the leading
CompactPCI Systems supplier; key competitors include Radisys and
Kontron.

Competitive factors in the sale of the segment’s products
include: price; product quality, performance and delivery;
supply integrity; quality reputation; responsiveness; and design
and manufacturing technology.

Payment Terms

Generally, contract payment terms range from 30 to 60 days.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $424 million at
December 31, 2004, compared to $347 million at
December 31, 2003. The 2004 backlog is believed to be
generally firm and approximately 100% of that amount is expected
to be recognized as revenue during 2005. This forward looking
estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future
events that may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is important to the segment’s business.
Reference is made to the material under the heading “Other
Information” for information relating to patents and
trademarks and research and development activities with respect
to this segment.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment does not carry significant amounts of inventory.

All materials used by our operations are readily available at
this time. We use electricity and gas in our operations, which
are currently adequate in supply. Labor is generally available
in reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing
facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the
aforementioned items could affect our results.

In certain circumstances generally pursuant to warranties, we
permit customers to return products. We believe that the return
policies in all businesses conform to standard industry
practices. Our business has not experienced significant seasonal
buying patterns.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Deer Park, Illinois. We also
have major facilities located in Tempe, Arizona; Lawrenceville,
Georgia; Farmington Hills, Michigan; Elma, New York; Seguin,
Texas; Nogales, Mexico; Tianjin, China; Angers, France; Munich,
Germany; and Penang, Malaysia. Most of our ACES products are
manufactured in our Seguin, Texas and Nogales, Mexico
facilities. We manufacture all of our ESG products in Asia,
primarily in two of our facilities in China and Malaysia. The
manufacture of ECCG products has been transferred to contract
manufacturers and our facility in Nogales, Mexico.



Broadband Communications Segment

The Broadband Communications segment (“BCS” or the
“segment”) designs, manufactures and sells a wide
variety of broadband products, including: (i) digital
systems and set-top terminals for cable television and broadcast
networks, (ii) high speed data products, including cable
modems and cable modem termination systems (“CMTS”),
as well as Internet Protocol (“IP”)-based telephony
products, (iii) access network technology, including hybrid
fiber coaxial network transmission systems and
fiber-to-the-premise (“FTTP”) transmission systems,
used by cable television operators, (iv) digital satellite
television systems; (v) direct-to-home (“DTH”)
satellite networks and private networks for business
communications, and (vi) high-speed data, video and voice
broadband systems over existing phone lines. In 2004, BCS net
sales represented 7% of the Company’s consolidated net
sales.

Principal Products and Services

The segment is a leading provider of end-to-end networks used in
the cable television industry for the delivery of video, voice
and data services over hybrid fiber coaxial networks. These
broadband networks include products used to transport
programming by broadcasters, products used at the cable
operator’s headend (central office) and products used at
the cable operator’s outside transmission plant. We also
sell a suite of interactive digital set-top terminals for the
end customer’s home that enable advanced interactive
entertainment and informational services, including
video-on-demand (“VOD”), digital video recording
(“DVR”), Internet access, e-mail, e-commerce, chat
rooms, pay-per view, and decoding and processing of high
definition television (“HDTV”) to be transmitted over
networks using our technology and other IP services. Our
interactive digital set-top terminals also deliver advanced
interactive services focused on digital video
broadcast-compliant (“DVB-compliant”) markets around
the world. We also provide digital system control equipment,
encoders, access control equipment and a wide range of digital
satellite receivers. Our digital business (set top boxes and
video infrastructure equipment) accounted for approximately 60%
of our revenue in 2004 and is expected to account for a
substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.

Our Surfboard® family of cable modems delivers high-speed
Internet access to subscribers over cable networks. These
Surfboard® products also include wireless networking
devices with high-speed Internet access for a complete home,
small office or small-to-medium enterprise communications system.

To complete the end-to-end broadband network system, we design
and manufacture a diverse family of broadband infrastructure
access applications for broadband services including video,
voice, and data communications. These products include CMTS,
headend products, amplifiers, taps, passives and optoelectronics.

Our products are marketed primarily to cable television
operators, satellite television programmers, and other
communications providers worldwide and are sold primarily by our
sales personnel who are skilled in the technology of these
systems. We have also expanded our traditional distribution
channels by selling directly to consumers in a variety of retail
markets. Through retail, we market and sell cable modems,
cordless telephones, home networking products and advanced
digital set-top terminals. We have also expanded our product
solutions for specific applications, including home and family
monitoring.

Our Industry

Demand for our products depends primarily on: (i) capital
spending by providers of broadband services for constructing,
rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems, and
(ii) the marketing of advanced communications services by
those providers. The amount of spending by these providers, and
therefore a majority of our sales and profitability, are
affected by a variety of factors, including: (i) general
economic conditions; (ii) the continuing trend of
consolidation within the cable and telecommunications
industries; (iii) the financial condition of cable
television system operators and alternative communications
providers, including their access to financing; (iv) the
rate of digital penetration; (v) technological
developments; (vi) standardization efforts that impact the
deployment of new equipment; and (vii) new legislation and
regulations affecting the equipment sold by the segment. In
2004, our customers increased their spending on our products,
primarily due to the increase in digital video and data
subscribers and the deployment of advanced video platforms by
cable operators for HDTV/DVR applications.



Our Strategy

We continue to focus on our strategy to innovate and enhance our
end-to-end network portfolio. We are focused on accelerating the
rate of digital penetration by broadband operators in North
America through the introduction of an enhanced suite of digital
set-top terminals, including more cost-effective products
designed to increase the number of set-tops per household, as
well as higher-end products for premium service, including HDTV
and DVR applications. We also continue to focus on opportunities
in regions outside of North America, including the development
of digital video products designed to be compliant with
technology required in these regions.

We are focused on enhancing and expanding our infrastructure
offerings, including next-generation products in the CMTS and
fiber optic network markets. Sales of our CMTS infrastructure
products increased in 2004 and are expected to continue to
increase in 2005 as cable operators build out their networks to
accommodate enhanced data and voice over IP applications. We
also will continue to expand our portfolio of data products
beyond the traditional cable modem business and into voice
modems. We are focused on providing home networking and
monitoring products, including wireless networking devices with
high-speed Internet access for a complete home, small office or
small-to-medium enterprise communications system.

Customers

We are dependent upon a small number of customers for a
significant portion of our sales. The vast majority of our sales
are in the U.S.—where a small number of large cable
television multiple system operators (MSOs) own a large portion
of the cable systems and account for a significant portion of
the total capital spending in the industry. Comcast Corporation
accounted for approximately 30% of the segment’s net sales
in 2004. The loss of business in the future from Comcast or any
of the other major MSOs could have a material adverse effect on
the segment’s business.

Competition

The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive.

The rapid technological changes occurring in each of the markets
in which we compete are expected to lead to the entry of many
new competitors.

We compete worldwide in the market for digital set-top terminals
for broadband and satellite networks. Based on 2004 annual
sales, we believe we are the leading provider of digital cable
set-top terminals in North America. Our digital cable set-top
terminals compete with products from a number of different
companies, including: (i) those that develop and sell
substitute products that are distributed by direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) service providers through retail channels,
(ii) those that develop, manufacture and sell products of
their own design, and (iii) those that license technology
from us or other competitors. In North America, our largest
competitor is Scientific-Atlanta. Other competitors in North
America include Cisco, Arris, and C-COR. Outside of North
America, where we have a smaller market position, we compete
with many equipment suppliers, including several consumer
electronics companies.

The traditional competitive environment in the North American
cable market continues to change for several reasons. First,
based on our customers’ requirements, we have begun and
will continue to license certain of our technology to certain
competitors. In 2005, we expect to license our technology to
more licensees, which may result in increased competition for
sales of digital set-top terminals in our markets. Second, per
OpenCable specifications, televisions were introduced in 2004
that will no longer require a digital set-top box for one-way
broadcast digital services. Future versions of this
specification will enable similar devices to access pay-per-view
and VOD applications without a set-top box. The FCC also has
mandated that digital tuners be incorporated into all television
sets sold in the U.S. by 2006. Television manufacturers are
expected to integrate technology that is available in our
set-top terminals into their products in the future and bypass
the need for a set-top terminal for certain applications.

Historically, reception of digital television programming from
the cable broadband network required a set-top terminal with
security technology that was compatible with the network. This
security technology has limited the availability of set-top
terminals to those manufactured by a few cable network
manufacturers, including Motorola. The FCC has enacted
regulations requiring separation of security functionality from
set-top terminals by July 1, 2006. To meet this
requirement, we have developed security modules for sale to
cable operators for use with our own and third-party set-top
terminals. As a step towards this implementation, in 2002, the
cable industry and



consumer electronic manufacturers agreed to a uni-directional
security interface that allows third-party devices to access
broadcast programming (not pay-per-view or VOD) with a security
device. These devices became widely available in 2004. A full
two-way security interface specification is in development, and
compliant devices are likely to be available in 2006. These
changes are expected to increase competition and encourage the
sale of set-top terminals to consumers in the retail market.
Traditionally, cable service providers have leased the set-top
terminal to their customers.

All of these changes could adversely impact our competitive
position and our sales and profitability. Most of our sales and
profits arise from the sale of our set-top terminals.

We also compete worldwide in the market for broadband data
products. We believe that we are the leading provider of cable
modems worldwide, competing with a number of consumer electronic
companies and various original design manufacturers worldwide.

Competitive factors for our products and systems include:
technology offered, product and system performance, features,
quality, delivery, availability and price. We believe that we
enjoy a strong competitive position because of our large
installed cable television equipment base, strong relationships
with major communication system operators worldwide,
technological leadership and new product development
capabilities.

Payment Terms

Generally, our payment terms are consistent with the industry
and range from 30 to 60 days. Extended payment terms are
provided to customers from time to time on a case-by-case basis.
Such extended terms are isolated in nature and historically have
not related to a significant portion of our revenues.

Regulatory Matters

Many of our products are subject to regulation by the FCC or
other communications regulatory agencies. In addition, our
customers and their networks, into which our products are
incorporated, are subject to government regulation. Government
regulatory policies affecting either the willingness or the
ability of cable operators to offer certain services, or the
terms on which the companies offer the services and conduct
their business, may affect the segment’s results.
Regulatory actions also have impacted competition, as discussed
above.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $314 million at
December 31, 2004, compared to $299 million at
December 31, 2003. The increase in backlog and related
orders primarily reflects increased orders from our customers
for advanced set tops. The 2004 order backlog is believed to be
generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
recognized as revenue in 2005. The forward-looking estimates of
the firmness of such orders is subject to future events, which
may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

We seek to build upon our core enabling technologies, such as
digital compression, encryption and conditional access systems,
in order to lead worldwide growth in the market for broadband
communications networks. Our policy is to protect our
proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and
foreign patent applications to protect technology and
improvements that we consider important to the development of
our business. We also rely on our proprietary knowledge and
ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our
competitive position, and will periodically seek to include our
proprietary technologies in certain patent pools that support
the implementation of standards. We are a founder of MPEG LA,
the patent licensing authority established to foster broad
deployment of MPEG-2 compliant systems. We have also licensed
our digital conditional access technology,
DigiCipher® II, to other equipment suppliers. We also
enter into other license agreements, both as licensor and
licensee, covering certain products and processes with various
companies. These license agreements require the payment of
certain royalties that are not expected to be material to the
segment’s financial results.



Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

Substantially all of our products are manufactured at our
facilities in Taipei, Taiwan and Nogales, Mexico. Inventory
levels are managed in line with existing business conditions.

We source our raw materials primarily from large multinational
corporations that supply the electronics and telecommunications
industries. In general, we have access to several sources of
supply for each component in our major products; however, we
have some components that are currently available only from
limited sources. We have inventory controls and other policies
intended to minimize the effect of any interruption in the
supply of components. We currently source certain parts from
Broadcom Corporation and Texas Instruments Corporation for our
digital set-top terminals and cable modems. Any material
disruption in supply from Broadcom or Texas Instruments for
certain products would have a material adverse impact on our
operations.

Electricity is the primary source of energy required for our
manufacturing operations. These operations do not have
significant risk relating to the availability of this energy
source; however, possible shortages in the supply of electricity
would affect the segment’s operations. Labor is generally
available in reasonable proximity to the segment’s
manufacturing facilities.

Generally, we do not permit customers to return products. We
have not experienced seasonal buying patterns for our products
recently. However, as our retail cable modem and digital set-top
terminal sales increase, we may have increased sales during the
holiday season at the end of each year.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. We also
have research and development and administrative offices in
Rohnert Park, San Diego and San Jose, California;
Andover and Marlboro, Massachusetts; and Lawrenceville, Georgia.
We have several sales offices throughout North America, Europe,
Latin America and Asia, and we operate manufacturing facilities
in Taipei, Taiwan and Nogales, Mexico. Substantially all of our
manufacturing is in Taiwan and Mexico.

Other Products Segment

The Other Products segment includes: (i) various corporate
programs representing developmental businesses and research and
development projects, which are not included in any major
segment, and (ii) Motorola Credit Corporation (“MCC”),
the Company’s wholly-owned finance subsidiary. In 2004,
Other Products net sales represented 1% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.

2005 Change in Organizational Structure

In December 2004, the Company announced a reorganization of its
businesses and functions to align with the Company’s
seamless mobility strategy, which was effective on
January 1, 2005. The Company will be organized into four
main business groups, focused on mobile devices, networks,
government and enterprise, and the connected home. The Mobile
Devices business will be primarily comprised of the current
Personal Communications segment and the Energy Systems group
from the Integrated Electronic Systems segment
(“IESS”). The Networks business will be primarily
comprised of the current Global Telecom Solutions segment, the
Embedded Computing and Communications group from IESS, and the
next-generation wireline networks business from the Broadband
Communications segment (“BCS”). The Government and
Enterprise business will be primarily comprised of the current
Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions segment and the
Automotive Communications and Electronics Systems group from
IESS. The Connected Home business will be primarily comprised of
the current BCS, excluding the next generation wireline networks
business. In addition, the Company’s key support functions,
including supply-chain operations, information technology,
finance, human resources, legal, strategy and business
development, marketing, quality and technology will be
architected centrally and distributed throughout the Company.
The Company will be aligned into these four main operating
segments with the analysis of reportable segments to be
completed in the first quarter of 2005.



Other Information

Financial Information About Segments.

The response to
this section of Item 1 incorporates by reference
Note 10, “Information by Segment and Geographic
Region,” of Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data of this document.

Customers.

Motorola sold approximately 10% of its
products and services to Nextel and its affiliates in 2004. In
addition to Nextel, Motorola has several other large customers,
the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse
effect on Motorola. Based on 2004 annual sales, in addition to
Nextel, other large Motorola customers include China Mobile,
Cingular and Vodafone.

Approximately 2% of Motorola’s net sales in 2004 were to
various branches and agencies, including the armed services, of
the U.S. Government. All contracts with the
U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the
convenience of the Government.

Government contractors, including Motorola, are routinely
subjected to numerous audits and investigations, which may be
either civil or criminal in nature. The consequences of these
audits and investigations may include administrative action to
suspend business dealings with the contractor and to exclude it
from receiving new business. In addition, Motorola, like other
contractors, reviews aspects of its government contracting
operations, and, where appropriate, takes corrective actions and
makes voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Government. These
audits and investigations could adversely affect Motorola’s
ability to obtain new business from the U.S. Government.

Backlog.

Motorola’s aggregate backlog position,
including the backlog relating to other Motorola segments, as of
the end of the last two fiscal years was approximately as
follows:

December 31, 2004

$6.3 billion

December 31, 2003

$6.2 billion

Except as previously discussed in this Item 1, the orders
supporting the 2004 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table
are believed to be generally firm, and approximately 92% of the
backlog on hand at December 31, 2004 is expected to be
shipped or earned, with respect to contracts accounted for under
percentage-of-completion of accounting, during 2005. However,
this is a forward-looking estimate of the amount expected to be
shipped, and future events may cause the percentage actually
shipped to change.

Generally, Motorola recognizes revenue for product sales when:
(1) title transfers, (2) the risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred to the customer, (3) the
fee is fixed and determinable, and (4) collection of the
related receivable is probable, which is generally at the time
of shipment. Accruals are established, with related reduction to
revenue, for allowances for discounts and for price protection,
returns and incentive programs for distributors and end
customers related to these sales based on actual historical
exposure at the time the related reserves are recognized. For
long-term contracts, Motorola uses the percentage-of-completion
method to recognize revenues and costs based on the percentage
of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated
contract costs. For contracts involving new and unproven
technologies, revenues and profits are deferred until
technological feasibility is established, customer acceptance is
obtained and other contract-specific terms have been completed.
Provisions for losses are recognized during the period in which
the loss first becomes apparent. Revenue for services is
recognized ratably over the contract term or as services are
performed. Revenue related to licensing agreements is recognized
over the licensing period or at the time the Company has
fulfilled its obligations and the fee is fixed and determinable.

Research and Development.

Motorola’s business
segments participate in very competitive industries with
constant changes in technology. Throughout its history, Motorola
has relied, and continues to rely, primarily on its research and
development (“R&D”) programs for the development
of new products, and on its production engineering capabilities
for the improvement of existing products. Technical data and
product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola’s
business segments on a regular basis. Management believes,
looking forward, that Motorola’s commitment to R&D
programs, both to improve existing products and services and to
develop new products and services, together with its utilization
of state-of-the-art technology, should allow each of its
segments to remain competitive.

R&D expenditures relating to new product development or
product improvement were approximately $3.1 billion in
2004, compared to $2.8 billion in both 2003 and 2002.
R&D expenditures increased 9% in 2004 as compared to 2003,
after increasing 1% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Motorola
continues to believe that a strong



commitment to research and development is required to drive
long-term growth. Approximately 21,600 professional employees
were engaged in such research activities during 2004.

Patents and Trademarks.

Motorola seeks to obtain patents
and trademarks to protect our proprietary position whenever
possible and practical.

As of December 31, 2004, Motorola owned approximately 8,416
utility and design patents in the U.S. and 12,885 patents in
foreign countries. These foreign patents are mostly counterparts
of Motorola’s U.S. patents, but a number result from
research conducted outside the U.S. and are originally filed in
the country of origin. During 2004, Motorola was granted 572
U.S. utility and design patents. The numbers of patents
reported exclude Freescale Semiconductor. Many of the patents
owned by Motorola are used in its operations or licensed for use
by others, and Motorola is licensed to use certain patents owned
by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and
are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of
the products subject to licenses.

Environmental Quality.

Compliance with federal, state and
local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment, has no material effect on capital expenditures,
earnings or the competitive position of Motorola.

Employees.

At December 31, 2004, there were
approximately 68,000 employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries,
as compared to approximately 88,000 employees at
December 31, 2003. The employment decrease in 2004
primarily reflects the impact of the spin-off of Motorola’s
former semiconductor operations during 2004.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations
and Export Sales.

Domestic export sales to third parties
were $2.7 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Domestic export sales to affiliates and
subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation, were
$1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Item 2: Properties

Motorola’s principal executive offices are located at 1303
East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196. Motorola also
operates manufacturing facilities and sales offices in other
U.S. locations and in many other countries. (See
“Item 1: Business” for information regarding the
location of the principal manufacturing facilities for each of
Motorola’s business segments.) Motorola owns 55 facilities
(manufacturing, sales, service and office), 31 of which are
located in North America and 24 of which are located in other
countries. Motorola leases 295 facilities, 118 of which are
located in North America and 177 of which are located in other
countries.

As compared to 2003, the number of facilities owned or leased
was reduced primarily because of the spin-off of Freescale
Semiconductor, the entity comprised of Motorola’s former
semiconductor operations, during 2004. In addition, as part of
Motorola’s overall strategy to reduce operating costs and
improve the financial performance of the corporation, a number
of businesses and facilities have either been sold or are
currently for sale. During 2004, facilities in Tempe, Arizona;
Northbrook, Illinois; Mesa, Arizona; and Swindon, England were
sold. A facility in Harvard, Illinois is currently up for sale.

Motorola generally considers the productive capacity of the
plants operated by each of its business segments to be adequate
and sufficient for the requirements of each business group. The
extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies
from plant to plant and from time to time during the year.

A substantial portion of Motorola’s products are
manufactured in Asia, primarily China, either in our own
facilities or in the facilities of others who manufacture and
assemble products for Motorola. If manufacturing in the region
was disrupted, Motorola’s overall productive capacity could
be significantly reduced.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Personal Injury Cases

Cases relating to Wireless Telephone Usage

Motorola has been a defendant in several cases arising out of
its manufacture and sale of wireless telephones.

Jerald P.
Busse, et al. v. Motorola, Inc. et al.,

filed
October 26, 1995 in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
Illinois, is a class action alleging the defendants have failed
to adequately warn consumers of the alleged dangers of cellular
telephones and challenging ongoing safety studies as invasions
of privacy. The Circuit Court entered summary judgment in
defendants’ favor in 2002. In June 2004, the Illinois
Appellate Court affirmed the summary judgment and dismissal of
the case. In January 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court denied
plaintiffs’ Petition for Leave to Appeal.

During 2001, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
transferred five cases,

Naquin, et al., v. Nokia
Mobile Phones, et al., Pinney and Colonell v. Nokia,
Inc., et al., Gillian et al., v. Nokia, Inc.,
et al., Farina v. Nokia, Inc., et al.,

and

Gimpelson v. Nokia Inc, et. al.,

which allege that the
failure to incorporate a remote headset into cellular phones
rendered the phones defective and that cellular phones cause
undisclosed injury to cells and other health risks, to the
United States District Court for the District of Maryland for
coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in the matter
called

In re Wireless Telephone Radio Frequency Emissions
Products Liability Litigation

. On March 5, 2003, the
MDL Court dismissed with prejudice, on federal preemption
grounds, the five cases. Plaintiffs appealed to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit; the appeal has
been briefed and argued, but no decision has been announced.

During 2002, the MDL panel transferred and consolidated six
additional cases,

Murray v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al.

,

Agro et. al., v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al

.,

Cochran et. al., v. Audiovox
Corporation, et al

.,

Schofield et al., v.
Matsushita Electric Corporation of America, et al.

,
each of which alleges that use of a cellular phone caused a
malignant brain tumor,

Dahlgren v. Motorola, Inc., et
al.,

which alleges that defendants manufactured and sold
cell phones that increase the risk of adverse cellular reaction
and or cellular dysfunction and failed to disclose biological
effects, and

Brower v. Motorola, Inc., et al.,

which contains allegations similar to

Murray

and

Dahlgren,

with the MDL Proceeding. On July 19, 2004,
the District Court for the District of Maryland found that there
was no federal court jurisdiction over

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

and remanded those cases to the
Superior Court for the District of Columbia. On
November 30, 2004, defendants moved to dismiss the

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

complaints.



Case relating to Two-Way Radio Usage

On January 23, 2004, Motorola was added as a co-defendant
with New York City in

Virgilio et al. v. Motorola
et al.,

filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York. The suit was originally filed
in December 2003 (against New York City alone) on behalf of
twelve New York City firefighters who died in the attack on the
World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

The amended complaint alleges that the twelve firefighters died
because the Motorola two-way radios they were using were
defective and did not receive evacuation orders and because the
City of New York and Motorola committed wrongful acts in
connection with a bid process that was designed to provide new
radios to the New York City Fire Department. Plaintiffs have
asserted claims for wrongful death due to a defect in product
design, wrongful death for failure to warn, wrongful death due
to fraudulent misrepresentations and deceitful conduct, wrongful
death due to negligent misrepresentations, and concerted action
against both Motorola and the City of New York. Plaintiffs seek
compensatory and punitive damages against Motorola in excess of
$5 billion.

On March 10, 2004, the court, to which all September 11
litigation has been assigned, granted Motorola’s and the
other defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint on the
grounds that all of the

Virgilio

plaintiffs had filed
claims with the September 11th Victims’ Compensation
Fund, that the statutory scheme clearly required injured parties
to elect between the remedy provided by this Fund and the remedy
of traditional litigation and that plaintiffs, by pursuing the
Fund, had chosen not to pursue litigation. On April 12,
2004, plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeal
for the Second Circuit.

Iridium-Related Cases

Class Action Securities Lawsuits

Motorola has been named as one of several defendants in putative
class action securities lawsuits arising out of alleged
misrepresentations or omissions regarding the Iridium satellite
communications business, which on March 15, 2001, were
consolidated in the District of Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications, Inc.,
et al.,

originally filed on April 22, 1999. On
August 31, 2004, the court denied the motions to dismiss
that had been filed on July 15, 2002 by Motorola and the
other defendants.

Bankruptcy Court Lawsuit

Motorola was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
Creditors of Iridium in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York on July 19, 2001.

In re Iridium
Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserts claims for
breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty, and fraudulent
transfer and preferences, and seeks in excess of $4 billion
in damages.

Iridium India Lawsuits

Motorola and certain of its current and former officers and
directors were named as defendants in a private criminal
complaint filed by Iridium India Telecom Ltd. (“Iridium
India”) in October 2001 in the Court of the Extra Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Khadki, Pune, India. The

Iridium
India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola, Inc. et al.

complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to, and did,
commit the criminal offense of “cheating” by
fraudulently inducing Iridium India to purchase gateway
equipment from Motorola, acquire Iridium stock, and invest in
developing a market for Iridium services in India. Under the
Indian penal code, “cheating” is punishable by
imprisonment for up to 7 years and a fine of any amount.
The court may also require defendants to compensate the victim
for its losses, which the complaint estimates at about
$100 million. In August 2003, the Bombay High Court granted
Motorola’s petition to dismiss the criminal action against
Motorola and the individual defendants. Iridium India has
petitioned the Indian Supreme Court to exercise its discretion
to review that dismissal, and that petition is pending.

In September 2002, Iridium India also filed a civil suit in the
Bombay High Court against Motorola and Iridium. The suit alleges
fraud, intentional misrepresentation and negligent
misrepresentation by Motorola and Iridium in inducing Iridium
India to purchase gateway equipment from Motorola, acquire
Iridium stock, and invest in developing a market for Iridium
services in India. Iridium India claims in excess of
$200 million in damages and interest. Following extensive
proceedings in the trial court and on appeal related to Iridium
India’s motion for



interim relief, Motorola has deposited approximately
$44 million in a specially designated account in India, and
the Indian Supreme Court has accepted for a full hearing at a
later date Motorola’s appeal regarding interim relief.

Shareholder Derivative Case

M

&

C Partners III v. Galvin, et al.,

filed January 10, 2002, in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois, is a shareholder derivative action filed
derivatively on behalf of Motorola against fifteen current and
former members of the Motorola Board of Directors and Motorola
as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges that the Motorola
directors breached their fiduciary duty to the Company and/or
committed gross mismanagement of Motorola’s business and
assets by allowing Motorola to engage in improper practices with
respect to Iridium. In October 2003, the court dismissed
plaintiff’s amended complaint in its entirety without
prejudice. In May 2004, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to
file a second amended complaint and served a demand on the
Motorola Board of Directors to investigate the alleged wrongful
conduct. At a July 10, 2004 Special Board Meeting,
Motorola’s Board appointed an investigatory committee to:
(i) evaluate the plaintiff’s demand, and
(ii) report back to the Board with a recommendation.

An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the Iridium-related
cases still pending could have a material adverse effect on
Motorola’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Telsim-Related Cases

Motorola is owed approximately $2 billion under loans to
Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
(“Telsim”), a wireless telephone operator in Turkey.
Telsim defaulted on the payment of these loans in April 2001.
The Company fully reserved the carrying value of the Telsim
loans in the second quarter of 2002. The Company is involved in
the following legal proceedings related to Telsim. The Uzan
family formerly controlled Telsim. Telsim and its related
companies are now under the control of the Turkish government.

U.S. Case

On January 28, 2002, Motorola Credit Corporation
(“MCC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola,
initiated a civil action with Nokia Corporation
(“Nokia”),

Motorola Credit Corporation and Nokia
Corporation v. Kemal Uzan, et al.,

against several
members of the Uzan family, as well as one of their employees
and controlled companies, alleging that the defendants engaged
in a pattern of racketeering activity and violated various state
and federal laws including Illinois common law fraud and the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly
known as “RICO”. The suit was filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the
“U.S. District Court”). The U.S. District
Court issued its final ruling on July 31, 2003 as described
below.

Upon filing the action, MCC and Nokia were able to attach
various Uzan-owned real estate in New York. Subsequently, this
attachment order was expanded to include a number of bank
accounts, including those owned indirectly by the Uzans. On
May 9, 2002, the U.S. District Court entered a
preliminary injunction confirming the prejudgment relief
previously granted. These attachments remain in place.

The U.S. District Court tried the case without a jury to
conclusion on February 19, 2003. Subsequent to the trial of
the case, and before a final ruling had been issued, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (“the
Appellate Court”) issued an opinion on March 7, 2003
regarding a series of appeals filed by the Uzans from the
U.S. District Court’s earlier rulings. In its opinion,
the Appellate Court remanded the case back to the
U.S. District Court on the grounds that the RICO claims
were premature and not yet ripe for adjudication. The Appellate
Court directed that the RICO claims be dismissed without
prejudice to their being later reinstated. The Appellate Court,
however, upheld the May 2002 Preliminary Injunction, finding
that it was sufficiently supported by the fraud claims under
Illinois law.

In accordance with the mandate from the Appellate Court, on
April 3, 2003, the U.S. District Court dismissed the
RICO claims without prejudice. On July 8, 2003, MCC filed a
motion seeking to have its RICO claims reinstated on the grounds
that pursuing further actions against Telsim would be
“futile.”

On July 31, 2003, the U.S. District Court entered a
judgment in favor of MCC for $4.26 billion. The
U.S. District Court declined to reinstate the RICO claims
(without prejudice to reinstatement), but held that the court
had jurisdiction to decide the merits of the Illinois fraud
claims. MCC’s fraud claims under Illinois common



law fraud and civil conspiracy were sufficient to support a full
judgment on behalf of MCC in the amount of $2.13 billion in
compensatory damages. The U.S. District Court also awarded
$2.13 billion in punitive damages. In addition, the
preliminary injunction was converted into a permanent
injunction, essentially unaltered in scope, and the
U.S. District Court also ordered the Uzans arrested and
imprisoned if they are found within 100 miles of the
court’s jurisdiction for being in contempt of court.

Thereafter, the Uzans appealed the U.S. District Court decision
to the Appellate Court. Over the next nine months, execution on
the judgment was, at different times, allowed to go forward and
then stayed by the Appellate Court. For some period of time, the
Uzans’ appeal was dismissed by the Appellate Court. On
April 16, 2004, the Appellate Court reinstated the
Uzans’ appeal and reinstated a stay of execution on the
judgment.

On August 11, 2004, the Appellate Court lifted the stay of
execution, in part, and allowed MCC to execute on its judgment
up to the full amount of the compensatory damages,
$2.13 billion. The Appellate Court kept the stay in place
with respect to the punitive damages and on that portion of the
judgment which would have allowed Motorola to execute against
entities owned and controlled by the Uzans. As a result,
MCC’s efforts to execute on its judgment against the Uzans
were recommenced in the United States, United Kingdom, Bermuda
and France, and the Company has begun to realize some
collections on its judgment. On October 22, 2004, the
Appellate Court affirmed the July 31, 2003 judgment as to
the compensatory damages of $2.13 billion. The Appellate
Court remanded three issues to the U.S. District Court for
additional findings and analysis. The issues are:
(1) whether the U.S. District Court was correct in
imposing a constructive trust over the stolen shares in favor of
Motorola (the constructive trust was affirmed as to Nokia);
(2) whether Motorola may collect its judgment against
non-party companies owned and controlled by the Uzans, and
(3) the amount of punitive damages the U.S. District
Court may impose against defendants in favor of Motorola. As a
result of this decision, enforcement actions have also
recommenced in Switzerland and Germany.

On November 5, 2004, defendants filed a petition for
rehearing and rehearing en banc by the entire Appellate Court.
On December 16, 2004, the Appellate Court denied the
Uzans’ petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with
respect to the Appellate Court’s October 22, 2004
decision affirming the July 31, 2003 judgment as to
compensatory damages of $2.13 billion. The mandate was
issued by the Second Circuit on December 30, 2004, making
this decision final. A remand to the district court on the
issues on which the Appellate Court requested clarification is
pending.

As the result of the lifting of the stay and the re-commencing
of the Company’s collection efforts, Motorola realized
$44 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 on its judgment
against the Uzans.

The Company continues to believe that the litigation, collection
and/or settlement processes will be very lengthy in light of the
Uzans’ continued resistance to satisfy the judgment against
them and their decision to violate various courts’ orders,
including orders holding them in contempt of court. In addition,
the Turkish government has asserted control and priority over
Telsim and certain other interests and assets of the Uzans and
this may make Motorola’s collection efforts in Turkey more
difficult.

Foreign Proceedings

In 2002, the United Kingdom’s High Court of Justice,
Queen’s Bench Division (the “UK Court”), on
motion of MCC, entered a worldwide freezing injunction against
Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan, Kemal Uzan and Aysegul Akay, freezing each
of their assets up to a value of $200 million. The Uzans
were ultimately held in contempt of court and ordered to be
incarcerated for failing to make a full disclosure concerning
their worldwide assets. On June 12, 2003, the UK Court of
Appeal affirmed the lower court’s decision against Cem Uzan
and Aysegul Akay, but concluded that MCC was not able to enforce
the freezing order against Hakan Uzan and Kemal Uzan because
they had no assets in England and Wales. Consequently, the lower
court’s rulings as to Hakan Uzan and Kemal Uzan were
reversed. As a result of the Court of Appeal’s decision,
the UK assets of Cem Uzan and Aysegul Akay, which total
approximately $12.7 million, remain frozen and MCC
previously commenced the execution process in satisfaction of
the U.S. District Court judgment. A hearing was held on
December 6, 2004 at MCC’s request to domesticate its
U.S. District Court judgment in the United Kingdom.
MCC’s request was granted and the U.S. judgment is now
recognized in the United Kingdom, allowing MCC to execute on
Uzan assets in the UK.

Motorola has also filed attachment proceedings in several other
foreign jurisdictions resulting in the preliminary seizure of
assets owned by the Uzans and various entities within their
control. As set forth above, some of these execution proceedings
are now ongoing (with some resulting payments to the Company),
while others remain stayed.



On February 5, 2002, Telsim initiated arbitration against
MCC in Switzerland at the Zurich Chamber of Commerce. In
Telsim’s request for arbitration, Telsim acknowledged its
debt, but has alleged that the disruption in the Turkish economy
during 2001 should excuse Telsim’s failure to make payments
on the MCC loans as required under the agreements between the
parties. Telsim seeks a ruling excusing its failure to adhere to
the original payment schedule and establishing a new schedule
for repayment of Telsim’s debt to MCC. Telsim has failed to
comply with its proposed new schedule, missing the first three
payments totaling approximately $85 million. In August
2003, MCC made a motion to the arbitration panel for a partial
award, seeking a judgment for the $85 million. On
January 26, 2004, the arbitral tribunal granted MCC’s
request and entered a Partial Final Award in favor of MCC and
against Telsim in the amount of $85 million. MCC has
initiated proceedings to enforce this award against Telsim in
Turkey. This proceeding has been discontinued (without
prejudice) while MCC appeals the Turkish court’s ruling
that MCC pay a multi-million dollar court fee. MCC requested a
second partial award of $40 million from the arbitration
panel to account for a loan payment that would have been due at
year-end 2003 even under Telsim’s proposed loan repayment
schedule. In June 2004, MCC filed a request for a further award
of $1.73 billion based on alleged further breaches of the
financing agreements and a reply in support of MCC’s
request for the $40 million partial award. On
November 25, 2004, the arbitral tribunal granted MCC’s
request and entered a Partial Final Award in favor of MCC and
against Telsim in the amount of $40 million. Motorola
expects to initiate proceedings to enforce this award against
Telsim in Turkey. Motorola is awaiting a ruling from the
arbitral tribunal with respect to the request for
$1.73 billion. In December 2004, a final round of
hearings was held on all outstanding issues and the case is now
before the panel for final adjudication.

On June 7, 2002, Rumeli Telfon (“Rumeli”)
initiated arbitration against MCC in the Zurich Chamber of
Commerce seeking a ruling requiring that MCC consent to
Rumeli’s request to place the stock that was pledged to MCC
(including improperly issued new shares, that effectively
diluted MCC’s pledge from the contractually mandated 66%
interest to a 22% interest) into an escrow account in
Switzerland. Pursuant to the request of Rumeli, this arbitration
was stayed. Upon the Company’s request, the panel has
re-started this arbitration.

On June 19, 2002, Telsim initiated arbitration against
Motorola, Ltd. and Motorola Komunikasyon Ticaret v.p. Servis
Ltd. Sti., both wholly-owned subsidiaries of Motorola, before
the International Chamber of Commerce in Zurich, Switzerland,
initially seeking approximately 179 million pounds as
damages for the defendants’ alleged sale of defective
products to Telsim. Telsim increased the amount of its claim to
approximately 300 million pounds. Motorola has denied the
claims and has filed a counterclaim valued at approximately
$20 million. On July 16, 2004, the arbitral panel
ruled in favor of Motorola’s contention that an overall cap
of liability applied to Telsim’s claims, but has not yet
ruled on how the cap is to be computed.

On October 13, 2004, Motorola filed an arbitration claim in
Washington, D.C., under a United States-Turkey bilateral
investment treaty involving the Turkish government, which
currently controls Telsim and claims priority over
Motorola’s interest in Telsim. Motorola claims that the
Turkish government has “expropriated” Motorola’s
investment in Telsim by taking over Telsim, obtaining
injunctions purportedly prohibiting Telsim from paying
MCC’s debt, and passing legislation requiring that Telsim
be sold and that the proceeds of the sale be distributed first
to the Turkish government, in priority over MCC’s claims.
Motorola seeks, among other things, a judgment in the amount of
$2 billion. On December 28, 2004, the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes registered
Motorola’s Request for Arbitration, thus finding that, at a
minimum, there is a possibility of jurisdiction for
Motorola’s claims.

Class Action Securities Lawsuits

A purported class action lawsuit,

Barry Family LP v.
Carl F. Koenemann,

was filed against the former chief
financial officer of Motorola on December  24, 2002 in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
SEC Rule 10b-5. It has been consolidated before the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the
“Illinois District Court”) with 18 additional putative
class action complaints which were filed in various federal
courts against the Company, its former chief financial officer
and various other individuals, alleging that the price of
Motorola’s stock was artificially inflated by a failure to
disclose vendor financing to Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon
Hizmetleri A.S. (Telsim), in connection with the sale of
telecommunications equipment by Motorola. In each of the
complaints, plaintiffs proposed a class period of
February 3, 2000 through May 14, 2001, and sought an
unspecified amount of damages. On August 25, 2004, the
Illinois District Court issued its decision on Motorola’s
motion to dismiss, granting the motion in part and denying it in
part. The court dismissed without prejudice the fraud claims
against the individual defendants and denied the motion to
dismiss as to Motorola. The plaintiffs chose not to file an
amended complaint; therefore, the fraud claims against the
individual defendants are



dismissed. The court, however, declined to dismiss the
plaintiffs’ claims that the individual defendants were
“controlling persons of Motorola.”

In addition, a purported class action,

Howell v. Motorola,
Inc., et al.,

was filed against Motorola and various of
its officers and employees in the Illinois District Court on
July 21, 2003, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and
violations of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act
(“ERISA”). The complaint alleged the defendants had
improperly permitted participants in Motorola’s 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase or hold
shares of common stock of Motorola because the price of
Motorola’s stock was artificially inflated by a failure to
disclose vendor financing to Telsim in connection with the sale
of telecommunications equipment by Motorola. The plaintiff
sought to represent a class of participants in the Plan for
whose individual accounts the Plan purchased or held shares of
common stock of Motorola from “May 16, 2000 to the
present”, and sought an unspecified amount of damages. On
October 3, 2003, plaintiff filed an amended complaint
asserting three claims for breach of fiduciary duties under
ERISA against 24 defendants grouped into five categories. The
amended complaint alleges the defendants violated ERISA by:
(1) continuing to offer Motorola stock as an investment
option under the Plan, even though it had become an imprudent
investment due to Motorola’s dealings with Telsim and other
third parties; (2) negligently making misrepresentations
and negligently failing to disclose material information
necessary for Participants to make informed decisions concerning
their participation in the Plan; and (3) failing to appoint
fiduciaries with the knowledge and expertise necessary to manage
Plan assets, failing to monitor those fiduciaries properly, and
failing to provide sufficient information to Participants and
other Plan fiduciaries. On December 9, 2003, all but one of
the defendants filed their motion to dismiss. On
September 23, 2004, the Illinois District Court granted the
motion in part and denied it in part. The court dismissed the
plan committee defendants from the case, without prejudice, and
left all other defendants in the lawsuit. On October 15,
2004, Howell filed a second amended complaint and a motion for
class certification. On December 3, 2004, Defendants filed
a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking to dismiss Plaintiff
Howell’s individual claims.

Charter Communications Class Action Securities
Litigation

On August 5, 2002, Stoneridge Investment Partners LLC filed
a purported class action in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Missouri against Charter Communications,
Inc. (“Charter”) and certain of its officers, alleging
violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. This complaint did not name
Motorola as a defendant, but asserted that Charter and the other
named defendants had violated the securities laws in connection
with,

inter alia,

a transaction with Motorola. In August
2003, the plaintiff amended its complaint to add Motorola, Inc.
as a defendant. The amended complaint alleges that Motorola
participated in a “scheme” with Charter in connection
with this transaction to artificially inflate Charter’s
earnings. On October 12, 2004, the court granted
Motorola’s motion to dismiss, holding that there is no
civil liability under the federal securities laws for aiding and
abetting. On October 26, 2004, the plaintiff filed a motion
for the reconsideration of the court’s decision. On
December  20, 2004, the court issued its ruling
denying plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of its
earlier decision to dismiss the complaint against Motorola. The
court issued a final judgement dismissing Motorola from the case
on February 15, 2005.

In re Adelphia Communications Corp. Securities and
Derivative Litigation

On December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a defendant in
two cases relating to the In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation (the “Adelphia
MDL”). The Adelphia MDL consists of at least eleven
individual cases and one purported class action that were filed
in or have been transferred to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. First, Motorola was named
as a defendant in the Second Amended Complaint in the individual
case of W.R. Huff Asset Management Co. L.L.C. v. Deloitte &
Touche, et al. This case was originally filed by W.R. Huff Asset
Management Co. L.L.C. on June 7, 2002, in the United States
District Court for the Western District of New York and was
subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New York as
related to the Adelphia MDL. Several other individual and
corporate defendants are also named in the amended complaint
along with Motorola.

As to Motorola, the complaint alleges a claim arising under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks recovery of
the consideration paid by plaintiff for Adelphia debt
securities, compensatory damages, costs and expenses of
litigation and other relief. Motorola has recently been served
with this complaint, the case is in its early stages, and fact
discovery has not yet begun. Motorola filed a motion to dismiss
this complaint on March 8, 2004.



Also on December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a
defendant in Stocke v. John J. Rigas, et al. This case was
originally filed in Pennsylvania and was subsequently
transferred to the Southern District of New York as related to
the Adelphia MDL. Several other individual and corporate
defendants are also named in the amended complaint along with
Motorola. As to Motorola, the complaint alleges a federal law
claim arising under Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder
and a state law claim of aiding and abetting fraud relating to
Adelphia securities. The complaint seeks return of the
consideration paid by plaintiff for Adelphia securities,
punitive damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, costs
and expenses of litigation and other relief. Motorola filed a
motion to dismiss this complaint on April 12, 2004.

On July 23, 2004, Motorola was named as a defendant in

Argent Classic Convertible Arbitrage Fund L.P.,
et al. v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., et al.

(the “Argent Complaint”). The Argent Complaint was
filed against Scientific Atlanta and Motorola in the Southern
District of New York. The Argent Complaint alleges a federal law
claim arising under Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder
relating to Adelphia securities. On October 12, 2004,
Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the Argent Complaint.

On September 15, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
filed in state court in Los Angeles, California, naming Motorola
and Scientific Atlanta and certain officers of Scientific
Atlanta,

Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association
et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

The
complaint raises claims under California law for aiding and
abetting fraud and conspiracy to defraud and generally makes the
same allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases
relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have been
transferred to the Southern District of New York. There are no
new substantive allegations. On October 8, 2004, Motorola
filed a motion to remove the California state court case to
federal court in California. On December 1, 2004, the
Multi-District Litigation Panel issued a conditional transfer
order transferring the case to federal court in New York.
Plaintiffs did not object to the conditional transfer order, and
the order transferring the case to New York is now final.

On October 25, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
filed in state court in Fulton County, Georgia, naming Motorola
and Scientific Atlanta and certain officers of Scientific
Atlanta,

AIG DKR SoundShore Holdings, Ltd.,
et al. v. Scientific Atlanta, et al.

The
complaint raises claims under Georgia law of conspiracy to
defraud and generally makes the same allegations as the other
previously disclosed cases relating to the

In re Adelphia
Communications Corp. Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have already been filed and transferred or are in the
process of being transferred to the Southern District of New
York. On November 22, 2004, Motorola filed a petition to
remove the state court case to federal court in Georgia and a
notice with the Multi District Panel requesting the case be
transferred to New York. On January 5, 2005, the
Multi-District Panel issued a conditional transfer order,
transferring the case to federal court in New York. On
January 20, 2005, the plaintiffs filed an objection before
the Multi District Panel, contesting the conditional transfer
order. Motorola has filed an opposition brief to their objection.

Motorola is a defendant in various other suits, claims and
investigations that arise in the normal course of business. In
the opinion of management, and other than discussed above with
respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate disposition of the
Company’s pending legal proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial
position and results of operations for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2004. This commentary
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto which appear beginning on page
84 under “Item 8: Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.”

Executive Overview

What businesses are we in?

Motorola reports six segments as described below.

The

Personal Communications

segment (“PCS”)
designs, manufactures, sells and services wireless handsets with
integrated software and accessory products. PCS’s net sales
in 2004 were $16.8 billion, representing 54% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales.

The

Global Telecom Solutions

segment (“GTSS”)
designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services wireless
infrastructure communication systems, including hardware and
software. GTSS provides end-to-end wireless networks, including
radio base stations, base site controllers, associated software
and services, mobility soft switching, application platforms and
third-party switching for CDMA, GSM, iDEN® and UMTS.
GTSS’s net sales in 2004 were $5.5 billion,
representing 17% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

The

Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions

segment (“CGISS”) designs, manufactures, sells,
installs and services analog and digital two-way radio, voice
and data communications products and systems to a wide range of
public-safety, government, utility, courier, transportation and
other worldwide markets. The business continues to invest in the
market for broadband data, including infrastructure, devices,
service and applications. In addition, the segment participates
in the expanding market for integrated information management,
mobile and biometric applications and services. CGISS’s net
sales in 2004 were $4.6 billion, representing 15% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales.

The

Integrated Electronic Systems

segment
(“IESS”) designs, manufactures and sells:
(i) automotive and industrial electronics systems,
(ii) telematics systems that enable automated roadside
assistance, navigation and advanced safety features for
automobiles, (iii) portable energy storage products and
systems, and (iv) embedded computing systems. IESS’s
net sales in 2004 were $2.7 billion, representing 9% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales.

The

Broadband Communications

segment (“BCS”)
designs, manufactures and sells a wide variety of broadband
products, including: (i) digital systems and set-top
terminals for cable television and broadcast networks,
(ii) high speed data products, including cable modems and
cable modem termination systems, as well as Internet
Protocol-based telephony products, (iii) access network
technology, including hybrid fiber coaxial network transmission
systems and fiber-to-the-premise transmission systems, used by
cable television operators, (iv) digital satellite
television systems, (v) direct-to-home satellite networks
and private networks for business communications, and
(vi) high-speed data, video and voice broadband systems
over existing phone lines. BCS’s net sales in 2004 were
$2.3 billion, representing 7% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.

The

Other Products

segment includes: (i) various
corporate programs representing developmental businesses and
research and development projects that are not included in any
major segment and (ii) Motorola Credit Corporation, the
Company’s wholly-owned finance subsidiary. The
segment’s net sales in 2004 were $387 million,
representing 1% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

In April 2004, the Company separated its semiconductor
operations into a separate subsidiary, Freescale Semiconductor,
Inc. (“Freescale Semiconductor”). In July 2004, an
initial public offering of a minority interest of approximately
32.5% of Freescale Semiconductor was completed. On
December 2, 2004, Motorola completed the spin-off of
Freescale Semiconductor from the Company by distributing its
remaining 67.5% equity interest in

Note: When discussing the net sales for each of our six
segments, we express the segment’s net sales as a
percentage of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Because
certain of our segments sell products to other Motorola
businesses, $963 million of intracompany sales were
eliminated as part of the consolidation process in 2004. As a
result, the percentages of consolidated net sales for each of
our business segments sum to greater than 100% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Freescale Semiconductor to Motorola shareholders. As of that
date, Freescale Semiconductor is an entirely independent
company. The financial results of Freescale Semiconductor have
been presented in Motorola’s consolidated financial
statements as a discontinued operation.

What were our key 2004 financial results?

What did we focus on in 2004?

In 2004, we were focused first and foremost on increasing
profitable sales and growing market share. We increased our net
sales significantly, with 35% growth in 2004 compared to 2003.
We also achieved our goal of increasing the profitability of
these sales, as evidenced by the 146% increase in operating
earnings in 2004, compared to 2003. Operating earnings increased
in four of the Company’s five major segments. Contributing
to the improvement in profitability were: (i) improvements
in supply chain processes in PCS, GTSS and CGISS,
(ii) overall cost-structure improvements,
(iii) ongoing cost reduction activities, and
(iv) improved average selling price (“ASP”) in
PCS due to a product mix shift towards higher-end products.

In addition, we believe we improved our market share position in
our two largest businesses, PCS and GTSS. Both the wireless
handset and wireless network industries experienced significant
growth in 2004. In PCS, total unit shipments outpaced the
industry as our market share grew and we solidified our number
two position in the worldwide handset market. In GTSS, the
business’ net sales growth was larger than the wireless
infrastructure industry, also resulting in increased market
share. In addition, CGISS remains the market share leader in
supplying two-way radio communications systems, and BCS remains
the market share leader for both digital set-tops and cable
modems.

What challenges and opportunities did our businesses face in
2004?

•

In PCS:

Our wireless handset business had a very strong
    year in 2004, reflected by a 53% increase in net sales, a 257%
    increase in operating earnings and increased market share. The
    increase in net sales was driven by an increase in unit
    shipments, which increased 39% in 2004 compared to 2003, and
    improved ASP, which increased 15% in 2004 compared to 2003. 2004
    was a record year for the wireless handset industry, as total
    industry unit shipments increased approximately 25% compared to
    2003. Our wireless handset business increased its unit shipments
    39% to 104.5 million and, since this growth outpaced
    overall industry

growth, we believe we gained market share in 2004 and solidified
    our hold on the second-largest worldwide market share of
    wireless handsets. This increase in net sales, accompanied by
    process improvements in the supply chain and benefits from
    ongoing cost reduction activities resulted in increased gross
    margin, which drove the increase in overall operating earnings
    for the business. The segment continues to experience intense
    competition in worldwide markets from numerous global
    competitors. As these strong competitive pressures continue in
    the industry, which typically experiences short life cycles for
    new products, the time to market for new product offerings
    becomes increasingly more important. The segment will continue
    to focus on investment in innovative and next-generation
    technologies to ensure we introduce industry-leading products.

Focusing on 2005

In 2005, we will continue to pursue profitable market share
growth. After aligning our structure to better enable our vision
of seamless mobility, we will serve our customers through four
distinct but integrated business units: mobile devices,
networks, government & enterprise and connected home.

Within this framework, we will continue to design and develop
devices (consumer and professional) for mobile communications,
partnering with retail and enterprise operators to create
compelling, “must-have” designs and functionality. We
will continue to design and develop networks to connect people
to people, people to things

and things to things — building the infrastructure
that makes communication possible. We will also continue to
offer end-to-end solutions for specialized markets such as
mission critical, governments and automotive.

Targeted plans for improving our competitive positioning and
operating results include:

We conduct our business in highly-competitive markets, facing
both new and established competitors. However, with our new
structure and focus in place, we believe we are well positioned
to execute our strategy and, in turn, increase our overall
business performance, including higher sales and earnings.

overall increase in net sales was primarily related to:
(i) a $5.8 billion increase in net sales by the
Personal Communications segment (“PCS”), driven by a
39% increase in unit shipments and a 15% increase in average
selling price (“ASP”), reflecting strong consumer
demand for new products, (ii) a $1.0 billion increase
in net sales by the Global Telecom Solutions segment
(“GTSS”), driven by a continued increase in spending
by the segment’s wireless service provider customers and
reflecting sales growth in all



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

technologies and regions, (iii) a $478 million
increase in net sales by the Broadband Communications segment
(“BCS”), primarily due to increased purchases of
digital cable set-top boxes by cable operators and an increase
in ASP for digital set-top boxes due to a mix shift towards
higher-end products, (iv) a $457 million increase in
net sales by the Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions
segment (“CGISS”), reflecting increased spending by
customers in both the segment’s government market, in
response to global homeland security initiatives, and in the
segment’s enterprise market, for business-critical
communications needs, and reflects increased net sales in all
regions, and (v) a $431 million increase in the
Integrated Electronic Systems segment (“IESS”),
primarily due to increased net sales in the automotive
electronics market, particularly telematics products, and
additional net sales from the addition of Force Computers, which
was acquired in August 2004.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $10.5 billion, or 33.5% of net sales, in
2004, compared to $7.6 billion, or 32.7% of net sales, in
2003. Three of the five major segments had a higher gross margin
as a percentage of net sales, including: (i) PCS, primarily
due to the increase in net sales and cost savings from ongoing
cost-reduction activities and improvements in the supply-chain,
(ii) GTSS, primarily due to the increase in net sales and
cost savings from improvements in the supply-chain, and
(iii) CGISS, primarily due to the increase in net sales,
cost savings from supply chain efficiencies and overall cost
structure improvements. These improvements in gross margin
percentage were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin
as a percentage of net sales in BCS, primarily due to higher
sales of new, higher-tier products carrying lower initial
margins.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expenditures increased 19% to $4.2 billion, or 13.4% of net
sales, in 2004, compared to $3.5 billion, or 15.2% of net
sales, in 2003. Four of the Company’s five major segments
had increased SG&A expenditures in 2004 compared to 2003,
although SG&A expenditures as percentage of net sales
decreased in four of the five major segments. The increase in
SG&A expenditures in 2004 compared to 2003 was driven by
increased general and selling expenditures, partially offset by
a decrease in administrative expenditures. General expenditures
increased in all five major segments, primarily due to an
increase in employee incentive program accruals. The increase in
selling expenditures was due to: (i) increased advertising
and promotional expenditures in PCS to support higher sales and
promote brand awareness, (ii) increased selling and sales
support expenditures, which increased in four of the five major
segments, driven by the increase in sales commissions resulting
from the increase in net sales, and (iii) increased
marketing expenditures in all five of the major segments.

Research and Development Expenditures

Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
increased 9% to $3.1 billion, or 9.8% of net sales, in
2004, compared to $2.8 billion, or 12.1% of net sales, in
2003. Four of the Company’s five major segments had
increased R&D expenditures in 2004 compared to 2003,
although R&D expenditures as percentage of net sales
decreased in four of the five major segments. The increase in
R&D expenditures was primarily due to increased expenditures
by: (i) PCS, reflecting an increase in developmental
engineering expenditures due to additional investment in new
product development, (ii) CGISS, driven by increased
investment in new technologies, (iii) the Other Products
segment, due to increased spending on developmental businesses
and R&D projects, and (iv) IESS, primarily to support
business wins across the segment and due to increased
expenditures from the addition of Force Computers.

Reorganization of Businesses

In 2004, the Company recorded net reversals of $12 million
for reserves no longer needed, including $15 million of
reversals in the consolidated statements of operations under
Reorganization of Businesses and $3 million of charges in
Costs of Sales. The 2004 net reversals of $12 million
included $59 million of charges for employee separation
costs, $66 million of reversals for employee separation and
exit cost reserves no longer needed, and income of
$5 million related to fixed asset adjustments. The
$66 million of reversals constitute 2% of the
Company’s $3.3 billion in earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes in 2004.

Net reorganization of businesses charges in 2003 were
$39 million, including $23 million reflected in the
consolidated statements of operations under Reorganization of
Businesses and $16 million included in Costs of Sales. The
2003 net charges of $39 million included
$174 million of charges for employee separation and exit
costs,



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

$145 million of reversals for employee separation and exit
cost reserves no longer needed, $38 million in charges for
the impairment of assets classified as held-for-sale, and
$28 million in fixed asset adjustments, primarily for
assets which the Company intends to use that were previously
classified as held-for-sale. The $145 million of reversals
constituted 11% of the Company’s $1.4 billion in
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in 2003.
These charges are discussed in further detail in the
“Reorganization of Businesses Programs” section below.

Other Charges (Income)

The Company recorded net charges of $111 million in Other
Charges (Income) in 2004, compared to net income of
$57 million in 2003. The net charges of $111 million
in 2004 primarily consist of: (i) a $125 million
impairment charge related to goodwill associated with a sensor
business within the Other Products segment, and
(ii) $34 million of charges for in-process research
and development (“IPR&D”) related to the
acquisitions by CGISS of MeshNetworks, Inc. and CRISNET, Inc.,
by BCS of Quantum Bridge, and by IESS of Force Computers. These
items were partially offset by $44 million in income from
the reversal of financing receivable reserves due to the partial
collection of the previously-uncollected receivable from Telsim.

The net income of $57 million in 2003 primarily consisted
of: (i) $69 million in income from the reversal of
accruals no longer needed due to a settlement with the
Company’s insurer on items related to previous
environmental claims, (ii) $59 million in income due
to the reassessment of remaining reserve requirements as a
result of a litigation settlement agreement with The Chase
Manhattan Bank regarding Iridium, and
(iii) $41 million in income from the sale of
Iridium-related assets that were previously written down. These
items were partially offset by: (i) a $73 million
impairment charge relating to goodwill associated with the
infrastructure business of BCS, and (ii) $32 million
of IPR&D charges related to the acquisition of Winphoria
Networks, Inc. by GTSS.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was $199 million in 2004, compared to
$294 million in 2003. Net interest expense in 2004 included
interest expense of $353 million, partially offset by
interest income of $154 million. Net interest expense in
2003 included interest expense of $423 million, partially
offset by interest income of $129 million. The decrease in
net interest expense in 2004 compared to 2003 reflects:
(i) a reduction in total debt during 2004,
(ii) benefits derived from fixed-to-floating interest rate
swaps, and (iii) an increase in interest income due to
higher average cash balances.

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
$460 million in 2004, compared to $539 million in
2003. The 2004 net gains were primarily: (i) a
$130 million gain on the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation, (ii) a
$122 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel Communications, Inc.
(“Nextel”), (iii) an $82 million gain on the
sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Telus
Corporation, and (iv) a $68 million gain on the sale
of a portion of the Company’s shares in Nextel Partners,
Inc. (“Nextel Partners”).

The 2003 net gains were primarily: (i) a
$255 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel, (ii) an $80 million
gain on the sale of the Company’s shares in Symbian
Limited, (iii) a $65 million gain on the sale of the
Company’s shares in UAB Omnitel of Lithuania, and
(iv) a $61 million gain on the sale of a portion of
the Company’s shares in Nextel Partners.

Other

Charges classified as Other, as presented in Other Income
(Expense), were $141 million in 2004, compared to
$142 million in 2003. The $141 million of charges in
2004 primarily related to: (i) net charges of
$81 million for costs related to the redemption of debt,
(ii) foreign currency losses of $44 million,
(iii) $36 million of investment impairment charges,
and (iv) $18 million in minority interest expense.
These items were partially offset by: (i) $29 million
of equity in net earnings of affiliated companies, and
(ii) $20 million in income related to the recovery of
a previously-impaired debt holding in a European cable operator.

The $142 million of charges in 2003 primarily related to:
(i) $96 million of investment impairment charges,
partially comprised of a $29 million charge to write down
to zero the Company’s debt holding in a European cable



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

operator, and (ii) foreign currency losses of
$73 million, partially offset by $30 million of equity
in net earnings of affiliated companies.

Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 33% in both 2004 and 2003,
representing tax expense of $1.1 billion and
$448 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004
effective tax rate reflects a $241 million benefit from the
reversal of previously-accrued income taxes as a result of
settlements reached with taxing authorities and a reassessment
of tax exposures based on the status of current audits. The 2004
effective tax rate also reflects nondeductible charges of
$125 million for the impairment of goodwill related to a
sensor business and $31 million for IPR&D charges
related to acquisitions.

The 2003 effective tax rate reflected a $61 million benefit
from the reversal of previously-accrued income taxes as a result
of settlements reached with taxing authorities and
$32 million for IPR&D charges related to acquisitions
in 2003.

Earnings from Continuing Operations

The Company had earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes of $3.3 billion in 2004, compared to earnings
from continuing operations before income taxes of
$1.4 billion in 2003. After taxes, the Company had earnings
from continuing operations of $2.2 billion, or
$0.90 per diluted share from continuing operations, in
2004, compared to earnings from continuing operations of
$928 million, or $0.39 per diluted share from
continuing operations, in 2003.

The $1.9 billion increase in earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes is primarily attributed to:
(i) a $2.9 billion increase in gross margin, primarily
due to the $8.2 billion increase in total net sales, as
well as cost savings from improved supply-chain execution,
overall cost structure improvements and ongoing cost reduction
activities, (ii) a $95 million decrease in net
interest expense, driven primarily by the reduction in total
debt in 2004, (iii) a $51 million decrease in overall
reorganization of businesses charges, including a
$13 million decrease in reorganization of businesses costs
recognized in Costs of Sales and a $38 million decrease in
costs recognized in Reorganization of Businesses. These
improvements in earnings were partially offset by: (i) a
$680 million increase in SG&A expenditures, primarily
driven by increases in: (a) employee incentive program
accruals, (b) sales commissions resulting from the increase
in net sales, (c) advertising and promotions expenditures
in PCS, and (d) marketing expenditures, (ii) a
$261 million increase in R&D expenditures, due
primarily to an increase in developmental engineering
expenditures in PCS due to additional investment in new product
development, and increased investment in new technologies by
CGISS, (iii) a $168 million increase in Other Charges,
primarily due to a $125 million impairment charge related
to goodwill associated with a sensor business and
$34 million in IPR&D charges related to 2004
acquisitions, and (iv) a $79 million decrease in gains
on sales of investments and businesses.

Results of Operations— 2003 Compared to 2002

Net Sales

Net sales were $23.2 billion in 2003, down 1% from
$23.4 billion in 2002. The overall decline in net sales was
primarily related to: (i) a $286 million decrease in
net sales by BCS, reflecting continued reductions in capital
spending by cable service providers, (ii) a
$196 million decrease in net sales by PCS, primarily due
to: (a) increased competition in Asia, (b) an
estimated loss in market share during 2003, resulting from
delays in the introduction of new products, driven by supply
constraints for a key component, and (c) the discontinued
sale of paging products during 2002, and (iii) a
$194 million decrease in net sales by GTSS, reflecting
continued reductions in capital spending by cellular operators
during 2003, specifically in mature markets. These decreases
were partially offset by: (i) a $382 million increase
in net sales by CGISS, reflecting increased customer spending
due to homeland security initiatives in the government market,
as well as an increase in sales due to the conflict in the
Middle East and the reconstruction of public safety systems in
Iraq, and (ii) a $76 million increase in net sales by
IESS, primarily due to the success of several new products in
the automotive market and increased demand from industrial
automation, medical and telecommunications customers.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $7.6 billion, or 32.7% of net sales, in
2003, compared to $7.7 billion, or 32.8% of net sales, in
2002. Three of the Company’s five major segments had a
higher gross margin and higher gross margin as a percentage of
net sales in 2003. The improvement in gross margin as a
percentage of net sales reflects: (i) an increase in CGISS,
primarily from the increase in net sales and a favorable product
mix, as well as continued benefits from prior cost-reduction
actions, and (ii) an increase in GTSS, primarily due to
benefits from prior cost-reduction actions and a decline in
reorganization of business charges reflected in costs of sales,
and (iii) an increase in IESS, primarily from the increase
in net sales and a decline in reorganization of business charges
reflected in costs of sales. These improvements in gross margin
percentage were partially offset by declines in BCS and PCS,
primarily due to the decline in net sales in these two segments.

The 2003 gross margin included reorganization of business
charges of $16 million, which were included in Costs of
Sales and primarily related to direct labor employee severance
costs. The 2002 gross margin included reorganization of business
charges of $68 million, which were included in Costs of
Sales and primarily related to direct labor employee severance
costs.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses declined 12% to $3.5 billion, or 15.2% of
net sales, in 2003, compared to $4.0 billion, or 17.0% of
net sales, in 2002. Four of the Company’s five major
segments had lower SG&A expenses in 2003 than in 2002. The
decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:
(i) decreased general and administrative spending by PCS,
reflecting benefits from cost-reduction efforts,
(ii) decreased selling and sales support costs by GTSS,
reflecting benefits from prior cost-reduction efforts, partially
offset by an increase in employee incentive program costs, and
(iii) decreased general and administrative spending by IESS
and BCS, reflecting benefits from prior cost-reduction actions.
These benefits were partially offset by increased SG&A
expenditures in CGISS, primarily due to an increase in employee
incentive program accruals.

Research and Development Expenditures

R&D expenditures increased slightly to $2.8 billion, or
12.1% of net sales, in 2003, compared to $2.8 billion, or
11.9% of net sales, in 2002. Four of the Company’s five
major segments had increased R&D expenditures in 2003. The
increase in R&D expenditures was primarily due to increased
expenditures by: (i) PCS, reflecting an increase in
developmental engineering expenditures due to the high volume of
new product offerings, and (ii) IESS, reflecting a
reduction in customer funding of R&D. These increased
expenditures were partially offset by a decrease in R&D
expenditures by GTSS, reflecting benefits from prior
restructuring actions.

Reorganization of Businesses

Net reorganization of businesses charges in 2003 were
$39 million, including $23 million reflected in the
consolidated statements of operations under Reorganization of
Businesses and $16 million included in Costs of Sales. The
2003 net charges of $39 million included
$174 million of charges for employee separation and exit
costs, $145 million of reversals for employee separation
and exit cost reserves no longer needed, $38 million in
charges for the impairment of assets classified as
held-for-sale, and $28 million in fixed asset adjustments,
primarily for assets which the Company intends to use that were
previously classified as held-for-sale.

Net reorganization of businesses charges in 2002 were
$673 million, including $605 million reflected under
Reorganization of Businesses and $68 million included in
Costs of Sales. The 2002 net charges of $673 million
included $623 million of charges for employee separation
and exit costs, $185 million of reversals for employee
separation and exit cost reserves no longer needed,
$306 million in charges for the impairment of assets
classified as held-for-sale, primarily related to the shut-down
of an engineering and distribution center in Illinois, and
$71 million in fixed asset adjustments, primarily for
assets which the Company intends to use that were previously
classified as held-for-sale. These charges are discussed in
further detail in the “Reorganization of Businesses
Programs” section below.

Other Charges (Income)

The Company recorded net income of $57 million in Other
Charges (Income) in 2003, compared to net charges of
$754 million in 2002. The net income of $57 million in
2003 primarily consisted of: (i) $69 million in



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

income from the reversal of accruals no longer needed due to a
settlement with the Company’s insurer on items related to
previous environmental claims, (ii) $59 million in
income due to the reassessment of remaining reserve requirements
as a result of a litigation settlement agreement with The Chase
Manhattan Bank regarding Iridium, and
(iii) $41 million in income from the sale of
Iridium-related assets that were previously written down. These
items were partially offset by: (i) a $73 million
impairment charge relating to goodwill associated with the
infrastructure business of BCS, and (ii) $32 million
of in-process research and development charges related to the
acquisition of Winphoria Networks, Inc. by GTSS.

The net charge of $754 million in 2002 was primarily
comprised of: (i) a $526 million charge for
potentially uncollectible finance receivables to fully reserve a
loan to Telsim, a wireless service provider in Turkey, that
defaulted on a $2.0 billion loan from the Company,
(ii) a $325 million intangible asset impairment charge
relating to an intellectual property license that enabled the
Company to provide national authorization services for digital
set-top terminals, and (iii) $12 million for acquired
in-process research and development charges, primarily related
to the acquisition of Synchronous, Inc. by BCS. These items were
partially offset by: (i) $63 million of income from
the reduction of accruals, primarily related to termination
settlements relating to Iridium, and (ii) $24 million
of income from the reduction of accruals no longer needed due to
the settlement with the Company’s insurer on items related
to previous environmental claims.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was $294 million in 2003, compared to
$355 million in 2002. Net interest expense in 2003 included
interest expense of $423 million, partially offset by
interest income of $129 million. Net interest expense in
2002 included interest expense of $538 million, partially
offset by interest income of $183 million. The decrease in
net interest expense in 2003 compared to 2002 reflects:
(i) a reduction in total debt during 2003,
(ii) benefits derived from fixed-to-floating interest rate
swaps due to lower interest rates, (iii) lower rates of
interest paid for commercial paper and other short-term
borrowings due to the low general interest rate environment
during 2003, and (iv) an increase in interest income due to
higher average cash balances.

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
$539 million in 2003, compared to $81 million in 2002.
The 2003 net gains primarily related to: (i) a
$255 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel, (ii) an $80 million
gain on the sale of the Company’s shares in Symbian
Limited, (iii) a $65 million gain on the sale of the
Company’s shares in UAB Omnitel of Lithuania, and
(iv) a $61 million gain on the sale of a portion of
the Company’s shares in Nextel Partners.

The 2002 net gains primarily related to: (i) the sale
of equity securities of other companies held for investment
purposes, (ii) the sale of the
CodeLink

tm

bioarray business, and (iii) the reduction of accruals
after the settlement of contingencies associated with the prior
sales of certain businesses.

Other

Charges classified as Other, as presented in Other Income
(Expense), were $142 million in 2003, compared to
$1.4 billion in 2002. These charges or income primarily
include: (i) foreign currency transaction gains (losses),
(ii) equity in net earnings (losses) of affiliated
companies, and (iii) investment impairment charges.

The $142 million of charges classified as Other in 2003
primarily related to: (i) $96 million of investment
impairment charges, partially comprised of a $29 million
charge to write down to zero the Company’s debt holding in
a European cable operator, and (ii) foreign currency losses
of $73 million, partially offset by $30 million of
equity in earnings of affiliated companies.

The $1.4 billion of charges classified as Other in 2002
primarily consisted of $1.2 billion of investment
impairment charges. These impairment charges were primarily
comprised of: (i) a $464 million writedown in the
value of the Company’s investment in Nextel, (ii) a
$321 million writedown of the Company’s debt security
holdings and associated warrants in a European cable operator,
(iii) a $95 million charge to write the value of the
Company’s investment in an Argentine cellular operating
company to zero, and (iv) a $73 million writedown of
the Company’s investment in Telus Corporation. Other
charges included: (i) $98 million of debt redemption
charges paid in 2002 that related to the $825 million of
Puttable Reset Securities (PURS) that were redeemed in
February 2003, and (ii) foreign currency losses of
$36 million.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 33% in 2003, representing a
$448 million net tax expense, compared to a 35% effective
tax rate, representing a $721 million net tax benefit, in
2002. The 2003 effective tax rate reflects a $61 million
benefit from the reversal of previously-accrued income taxes.
The tax reversal relates to a reassessment of the Company’s
income tax requirements given the settlement of certain
previously-pending income tax audits. The effective tax rate
also reflects nondeductible charges taken of $32 million
for IPR&D charges related to the 2003 acquisition of
Winphoria Networks, Inc.

Earnings (loss) from continuing operations

The Company had earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes of $1.4 billion in 2003, compared to a net
loss from continuing operations before income taxes of
$2.1 billion in 2002. After taxes, the Company had earnings
from continuing operations of $928 million, or
$0.39 per diluted share from continuing operations, in
2003, compared to a loss from continuing operations of
$1.4 billion, or ($0.59) per diluted share from continuing
operations, in 2002.

The $3.4 billion improvement in earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes is primarily attributed to:
(i) a $1.2 billion decrease in charges classified as
Other, primarily due to the reduction in investment impairment
charges, (ii) an $811 million decrease in Other
Charges (Income), primarily due to charges that occurred in 2002
that did not occur in 2003, which primarily consisted of a
$526 million charge related to potentially uncollectible
finance receivables from Telsim and a $325 million
intangible asset impairment charge relating to a license of
certain intellectual property, (iii) a $634 million
decrease in overall reorganization of business charges,
including a $52 million decrease in reorganization of
businesses costs recognized in Costs of Sales and a
$582 million decrease in costs recognized in Reorganization
of Businesses, (iv) a $462 million decline in SG&A
expenditures, primarily due to the benefits from prior
restructuring actions, (v) a $458 million increase in
gains on sales of investments and businesses, primarily due to a
$255 million gain from the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel and gains from the sale of
equity securities of other companies held for investment
purposes, and (vi) a $61 million decrease in net
interest expense. These items were partially offset by:
(i) a $114 million decrease in gross margin, primarily
due to the 1% decline in net sales, and (ii) a slight
increase in R&D expenditures.

Reorganization of Businesses

The Company records provisions for employee separation and exit
costs when they are probable and estimable. The Company
maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (Severance Plan)
which permits Motorola to offer eligible employees severance
benefits based on years of service in the event that employment
is involuntarily terminated as a result of a reduction-in-force
or restructuring. Each separate reduction-in-force has qualified
for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and, therefore,
such benefits are accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment Benefits”
(SFAS 112). Under the provisions of SFAS 112, the
Company recognizes termination benefits based on formulas per
the Severance Plan at the point in time that future settlement
is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on estimates
prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved by
management. Exit costs primarily consist of future minimum lease
payments on vacated facilities. At each reporting date, the
Company evaluates its accruals for exit costs and employee
separation costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate.
In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer required
because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because
employees previously identified for separation resigned from the
Company and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to
circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the
Reorganization of Businesses income statement line item when it
is determined they are no longer required.

The Company realized cost-saving benefits of approximately
$5 million in 2004 from the plans that were initiated
during 2004, representing $1 million of savings in Costs of
Sales, $1 million of savings in R&D expenditures, and
$3 million of savings in SG&A expenditures. Beyond
2004, the Company expects the plans implemented in 2004 to
provide annualized cost savings of approximately
$79 million, representing $25 million of savings in
Costs of Sales, $22 million of savings in R&D
expenditures and $32 million of savings in SG&A
expenditures.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Year Ended December 31, 2004

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded
net reversals of $12 million for reserves no longer needed,
including $3 million of charges in Costs of Sales and
$15 million of reversals under Reorganization of Businesses
in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Included in the aggregate $12 million of net reversals are
$59 million of charges for employee separation costs,
$66 million of reversals for employee separation and exit
cost reserves no longer needed, and income of $5 million
related to fixed asset adjustments. The additional charges of
$59 million are a result of the Company’s commitment
to productivity improvement plans aimed at improving the
Company’s ability to meet customer demands and reduce
operating costs. The productivity plans are designed to adjust
the Company’s workforce to align it with the Company’s
focus on seamless mobility and to eliminate positions in its
corporate functions in connection with the separation of the
Company’s former semiconductor operations into an entirely
independent Company, Freescale Semiconductor. Businesses
impacted by these plans include the Commercial, Government and
Industrial Solutions segment, the Integrated Electronic Systems
segment and the Broadband Communications segment, as well as
various corporate functions.

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs— Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$143 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2004 adjustments of $21 million represent
reversals of $32 million for accruals no longer needed,
partially offset by an $11 million translation adjustment.
The $38 million used in 2004 reflects cash payments. The
remaining accrual of $84 million, which is included in
Accrued Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets, represents future cash payments for lease termination
obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$116 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 2,100 employees, of
which 1,000 were direct and 1,100 were indirect. Direct
employees are primarily non-supervisory production employees and
indirect employees are primarily non-production employees and
production managers. The 2004 additional charges of
$59 million represent additional costs for approximately an
additional 900 employees. The adjustments of $34 million
represent reversals of accruals no longer needed.

During 2004, approximately 2,500 employees, of which
1,000 were direct and 1,500 were indirect employees,
were separated from the Company. The $95 million used in
2004 reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $46 million, which is included in
Accrued Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets, is expected to be paid to approximately 500 separated
employees.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2003

For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded
net reorganization of businesses charges of $39 million,
including $16 million in Costs of Sales and
$23 million under Reorganization of Businesses in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Included in the aggregate $39 million net charge are
$212 million of charges and $173 million of reversals
of accruals no longer needed. The charges primarily consisted
of: (i) $85 million in the Personal Communications
segment, primarily related to the exit of certain manufacturing
activities in Flensburg, Germany and the closure of an
engineering center in Boynton Beach, Florida,
(ii) $50 million in the Commercial, Government and
Industrial Solutions segment for segment-wide employee
separation costs, and (iii) $39 million in General
Corporate, primarily for the impairment of assets classified as
held-for-sale and employee separation costs. The
$212 million of charges were partially offset by reversals
of previous accruals of $173 million, consisting of:
(i) $125 million relating to unused accruals of
previously-expected employee separation costs across all
segments, (ii) $28 million, primarily for assets that
the Company intended to use that were previously classified as
held-for-sale, and (iii) $20 million for exit cost
accruals no longer required across all segments.

established for exit costs and employee separation costs from
January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003:

(1)

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs — Lease Terminations

The 2003 additional charges of $11 million were primarily
related to the exit of certain manufacturing activities in
Germany by the Personal Communications segment. The adjustments
of $20 million represent exit cost accruals across all
segments which were no longer needed. The 2003 amount used of
$57 million reflects cash payments of $52 million and
non-cash utilization of $5 million. The remaining accrual
of $143 million, is included in Accrued Liabilities in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. From this remaining
accrual, in 2004, the Company paid out $38 million and
reversed $32 million. The remaining accrual represents
future cash payments, primarily for lease termination
obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2003, the Company had an accrual of
$336 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 5,700 employees, of
which 2,000 were direct employees and 3,700 were indirect
employees. The additional charges of $163 million
represented the severance costs for approximately
3,200 employees, of which 1,200 were direct employees and
2,000 were indirect employees. The accrual was for various
levels of employees. The adjustments of $125 million
represent the severance costs for approximately
1,600 employees previously identified for separation who
resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were
redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original
plans were approved.

During 2003, approximately 5,200 employees, of which 2,000
were direct employees and 3,200 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The 2003 amount used of
$258 million reflects $254 million of cash payments to
these separated employees and $4 million of non-cash
utilization. The remaining accrual of $116 million is
included in Accrued Liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. From this remaining accrual, in
2004, the Company paid out $69 million, reversed
$33 million and expects $14 million of future cash
payments to be paid out to separated employees during the first
quarter of 2005.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2002

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded
net reorganization of businesses charges of $673 million,
including $68 million in Costs of Sales and
$605 million under Reorganization of Businesses in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Included in the aggregate $673 million charge is
$918 million of additional charges and $245 million of
reversals of accruals no longer needed. The additional charges
of $918 million were comprised of the following:
(i) $275 million in the Personal Communications
segment, primarily related to the shut-down of an engineering
and distribution center in Illinois, (ii) $224 million
in the Global Telecom Solutions segment, primarily related to
segment-wide employee separation costs and for exit costs
relating to a lease cancellation fee, and
(iii) $419 million for employee separation, fixed
asset impairments and lease cancellation fees across all other
segments. The $918 million charge was offset by
$245 million of reversals of previous accruals, consisting
of: (i) $108 million relating to unused accruals of
previously expected employee separation costs across all
segments, (ii) $77 million, primarily for exit cost
accruals no longer required across all segments, and
(iii) $60 million primarily for assets that the
Company intended to use that were previously classified as
held-for-sale.

Exit Costs— Lease Terminations

The 2002 additional charges of $156 million were related to
lease cancellation fees, primarily in Global Telecom Solutions
segment. The adjustments of $77 million represented exit
costs accruals across all segments which were no longer needed.
The 2002 amount used of $164 million reflects cash payments
of $161 million and non-cash utilization of
$3 million. In 2003 and 2004, the Company utilized
$87 million of the $209 million remaining accrual and
reversed $51 million. The remaining accrual represents
future cash payments, primarily for lease termination
obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2002, the Company had an accrual of
$358 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 6,500 employees, of
which 3,200 were direct employees and 3,300 were indirect
employees. The 2002 additional charges of $467 million
represented the severance costs for approximately
8,900 employees, of which 2,600 were direct employees and
6,300 were indirect employees. The accrual was for various
levels of employees. The reversals into income of
$108 million represent the severance costs for
approximately 900 employees previously identified for
separation who resigned from the Company and did not receive
severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen
when the original plans were approved.

During 2002, approximately 8,800 employees, of which 3,200
were direct employees and 5,600 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The 2002 amount used of
$381 million reflects $368 million of cash payments to
these separated employees and $13 million of non-cash
utilization. In 2003 and 2004, the Company utilized
$214 million of the $336 million remaining accrual and
reversed $122 million.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As highlighted in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the
Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are
impacted by four key components: (i) current cash and cash
equivalents, (ii) operating activities,
(iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing
activities. Each of these components is discussed below.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

During 2004, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents (which
are highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less) increased by $2.8 billion to
$10.6 billion at December 31, 2004, compared to
$7.8 billion at December 31, 2003. At
December 31, 2004, $3.8 billion of this amount was
held in the U.S. and $6.8 billion was held by the Company
or its subsidiaries in other countries. Repatriation of some of
the funds in other countries could be subject to delay and could
have potential adverse tax consequences.

In light of recently-passed tax laws, the Company expects to
repatriate cash during 2005, to the extent the repatriation is
consistent with business strategy and is economically
advantageous. However, the Company has not yet completed its
evaluation of the effect of the new tax law on its plans for
reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company
will evaluate its repatriation plans and the impact of the new
tax provision throughout 2005 and will report the repatriation
provision effect on financial results in the period the
repatriation plan or plans are defined and approved.

Operating Activities

The Company has generated positive cash flow from operations in
each of the last 4 years. The cash provided by operating
activities in 2004 was $3.1 billion, compared to
$2.0 billion in 2003 and $1.2 billion in 2002. The
primary contributors to cash flow from operations in 2004 were:
(i) earnings from continuing operations (adjusted for
non-cash items) of $3.0 billion, and (ii) a net
increase of $1.9 billion in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, primarily attributed to increases in accounts
payable, employee incentive program accruals, customer incentive
reserves and warranty reserves. These positive contributors to
cash flow were partially offset by: (i) an
$808 million increase in other current assets, (ii) a
$539 million increase in accounts receivable, (iii) a
$433 million increase in inventories, and (iv) a
$68 million increase in other net operating assets.

Accounts Receivable:

The Company’s net accounts
receivable were $4.5 billion at December 31, 2004,
compared to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2003. The
Company’s days sales outstanding (“DSO”),
excluding net long-term receivables, were 44.9 days at
December 31, 2004, compared to 49.1 days at
December 31, 2003. The decline in DSO reflects the
continuing improvement in receivables management across the
Company. The other key factor in the reduction of the overall
DSO was the reduction in accounts receivable balance and DSO by
the Global Telecom Solutions segment (“GTSS”) in 2004
compared to 2003, primarily due to an improvement in achieving
payment milestones in Asia. The increase in net accounts
receivable was primarily due to the increase in net sales in the
fourth quarter of 2004, compared to net sales in the fourth
quarter of 2003, primarily in the Personal Communications
segment (“PCS”).

Inventory:

The Company’s net inventory was
$2.5 billion at December 31, 2004, compared to
$2.1 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in the
net inventory balance reflects increased net inventory balances
in each of the Company’s five major segments. The increase
in the overall net inventory balance was primarily due to
increases by: (i) PCS, primarily due to higher levels of
components on hand due to the anticipated increase in net sales
in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first quarter of
2004, (ii) the Broadband Communications segment
(“BCS”), due to anticipated increased demand in 2005
compared to 2004, (iii) the Integrated Electronic Systems
segment (“IESS”), due to anticipated increased demand
in 2005 compared to 2004 and the acquisition of Force Computers,
and (iv) GTSS, due primarily to anticipated increased
demand in 2005 compared to 2004. The Company’s inventory
turns increased to 8.9 at December 31, 2004, compared to
7.6 at December 31, 2003. The increase in overall inventory
turns was driven by the increase in turns by PCS, primarily due
to the significant growth in net sales and effective inventory
management programs, and is evidence of benefits from the
continued focus on inventory and supply chain management process
throughout the Company. Inventory management continues to be an
area of focus as the Company balances the need to maintain
strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery
performance to its customers against the risk of inventory
obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer
spending requirements.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Reorganization of Businesses:

The Company has implemented
substantial reorganization of businesses plans. Cash payments
for exit costs and employee separations in connection with these
plans were $133 million in 2004, as compared to
$306 million in 2003. Of the $130 million
reorganization of businesses accrual at December 31, 2004,
$46 million relates to employee separation costs and is
expected to be paid in 2005. The remaining $84 million in
accruals relate to lease termination obligations.

Pension Plan Contributions:

The Company contributed
$652 million to its pension plans during 2004, compared to
$275 million in 2003. The Company expects to make cash
contributions of approximately $195 million to its pension
plans during 2005. Retirement-related benefits are further
discussed below in the “Significant Accounting
Policies—Retirement-Related Benefits” section.

Investing Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s investing
activities are: (i) capital expenditures,
(ii) strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, other
companies, and (iii) proceeds from dispositions of
investments and businesses.

Net cash used for investing activities was $163 million in
2004, as compared to net cash provided of $64 million in
2003 and net cash used of $251 million in 2002. The
$227 million increase in cash used for investing activities
in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to: (i) a
$197 million increase in cash used for acquisitions and
investments, net of cash assumed, and (ii) a
$150 million increase in capital expenditures. These items
of cash use were partially offset by: (i) a
$69 million decrease in purchases of short-term
investments, (ii) a $34 million increase in proceeds
received from the dispositions of property, plant and equipment,
and (iii) a $17 million increase in proceeds received
from the sale of investments and businesses.

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:

The Company used
cash for acquisitions and new investment activities of
$476 million in 2004, compared to cash used of
$279 million in 2003 and $79 million in 2002. The
largest components of the $476 million in 2004 expenditures
were: (i) $169 million for the acquisition of
MeshNetworks, Inc., a leading developer of mobile mesh
networking and position-location technologies by the Commercial,
Government and Industrial Solutions segment (“CGISS”),
(ii) $121 million, net of cash assumed, for the
acquisition of Force Computers, a worldwide designer and
supplier of open, standards-based and custom embedded computing
solutions, by IESS, (iii) the acquisition of Quantum Bridge
Communications, Inc., a leading provider of
fiber-to-the-premises solutions, by BCS, and (iv) the
acquisition of the remaining interest of Appeal Telecom of
Korea, a leading designer of CDMA handsets for the global
market, by PCS. The largest components of the $279 million
in 2003 expenditures were: (i) $179 million for the
acquisition of Winphoria Networks, Inc., a core infrastructure
provider of next-generation, packet-based mobile switching
centers for wireless networks, by GTSS, and (ii) the
acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Next
Level Communications, Inc.

Capital Expenditures:

Capital expenditures were
$494 million in 2004, compared to $344 million in 2003
and $387 million in 2002. The increase in capital
expenditures was primarily due to an increase by CGISS, driven
by investment in large systems what will be built, owned and
operated by the Company. Capital expenditures increased in each
of the Company’s five major segments in 2004 compared to
2003. The Company’s emphasis in making capital expenditures
is to focus on strategic investments driven by customer demand
and new design capability.

Sales of Investments and Businesses:

The Company received
$682 million in proceeds from the sales of investments and
businesses in 2004, compared to proceeds of $665 million in
2003 and $94 million in 2002. The $682 million of
proceeds in 2004 were primarily comprised of:
(i) $216 million from the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation,
(ii) $141 million from the sale of a portion of the
Company’s remaining shares in Nextel Communications, Inc.
(“Nextel”), (iii) $117 million from the sale
of the Company’s remaining shares in Telus Corporation, and
(iv) $77 million from the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel Partners, Inc. (“Nextel
Partners”). The $665 million of proceeds in 2003 were
primarily comprised of: (i) $335 million from the sale
of a portion of the Company’s shares in Nextel,
(ii) $117 million from the sale of the Company’s
shares in UAB Omnitel of Lithuania, (iii) $94 million
from the sale of the Company’s shares in Symbian Limited,
and (iv) $73 million from the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel Partners.

Short-Term Investments:

At December 31, 2004, the
Company had $152 million in short-term investments (which
are highly-liquid fixed-income investments with an original
maturity greater than three months but less than one year),
compared to $139 million of short-term investments at
December 31, 2003.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Available-For-Sale Securities:

In addition to available
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, the
Company views its available-for-sale securities as an additional
source of liquidity. The majority of these securities represent
investments in technology companies and, accordingly, the fair
market values of these securities are subject to substantial
price volatility. In addition, the realizable value of these
securities is subject to market and other conditions. At
December 31, 2004, the Company’s available-for-sale
securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value of
$2.9 billion, which represented a cost basis of
$616 million and a net unrealized gain of
$2.3 billion. At December 31, 2003, the Company’s
available-for-sale securities portfolio had an approximate fair
market value of $2.9 billion, which represented a cost
basis of $499 million and a net unrealized gain of
$2.4 billion.

Nextel Investment:

In March 2003, the Company entered
into three agreements with multiple investment banks to hedge up
to 25 million of its shares of Nextel common stock. The
three agreements are to be settled over periods of three, four
and five years, respectively. Under these agreements, the
Company received no initial proceeds, but has retained the right
to receive, at any time during the contract periods, the present
value of the aggregate contract “floor” price.
Pursuant to these agreements, and exclusive of any present value
discount, the Company is entitled to receive aggregate proceeds
of approximately $333 million. The precise number of shares
of Nextel common stock that the Company will deliver to satisfy
the contracts is dependent upon the price of Nextel common stock
on the various settlement dates. The maximum aggregate number of
shares the Company would be required to deliver under these
agreements is 25 million and the minimum number of shares
is 18.5 million. Alternatively, the Company has the
exclusive option to settle the contracts in cash. The Company
will retain all voting rights associated with the up to
25 million hedged Nextel shares. Pursuant to customary
market practice, the covered shares are pledged to secure the
hedge contracts. The Company has recorded $340 million and
$310 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, in Other Liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheet to reflect the fair value of the Nextel hedge.

Motorola, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary Motorola
SMR, Inc. (“Motorola SMR”) owns 29,660,000 shares of
Class B Non-Voting Common Stock of Nextel (the “Nextel
Class B Shares”). On December 15, 2004, Nextel
and Sprint Corp. (“Sprint”) announced a definitive
agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) for a merger of the
two companies in a stock-for-stock transaction. Pursuant to a
letter agreement dated December 14, 2004 among Motorola,
Motorola SMR and Nextel (the “Letter Agreement”),
Motorola and Motorola SMR agreed not to dispose of their Nextel
Class B Shares (or any shares of non-voting common stock of
Sprint/ Nextel issued in exchange therefor pursuant to the
Merger Agreement) for a period of up to 2 years. In
exchange for the restrictions imposed under the Letter
Agreement, Nextel agreed to pay Motorola a fee of
$50 million (the “Consent Fee”) on the third
business day following the receipt of necessary approvals by the
stockholders of Nextel and Sprint for the merger. Nextel has
agreed to pay the Consent Fee to Motorola at an earlier date
under certain circumstances.

Financing Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s financing
activities are: (i) net proceeds from (or repayment of)
commercial paper and short-term borrowings, (ii) net
proceeds from (or repayment of) long-term debt securities,
(iii) the payment of dividends, (iv) proceeds from the
issuance of stock due to exercises of employee stock options and
purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, and
(v) distributions from (to) discontinued operations.

Net cash used for financing activities was $237 million in
2004, as compared to $757 million in 2003 and
$402 million in 2002. Cash used for financing activities in
2004 was primarily: (i) $1.5 billion to redeem all
outstanding 6.75% Debentures due 2006 (the “2006
Debentures”) in July 2004, (ii) $500 million to
redeem all outstanding Trust Originated Preferred
Securities

sm

(the “TOPrS”) in March 2004,
(iii) $500 million to repay, at maturity, all
outstanding 6.75% Debentures due 2004 in June 2004,
(iv) $202 million to redeem a portion of the
7.60% Notes due 2007 (the “2007 Notes”) in July
2004, (v) $115 million for the open market repurchase
of a portion of the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 (the
“2028 Debentures”) in August 2004, and
(vi) $378 million to pay dividends. This cash used for
financing activities was partially offset by: (i) net
proceeds of $1.3 billion distributed to the Company by
Freescale Semiconductor in July 2004 at the time of the initial
public offering by Freescale Semiconductor of approximately
32.5% of its total common shares and the issuance of senior debt
securities in an aggregate principal amount of
$1.25 billion, (ii) net proceeds of $1.2 billion
received from the sale of stock pursuant to the terms of 7.00%
Equity Security Units (the “MEUs”), and
(iii) proceeds of approximately $500 million received
from the issuance of common stock in connection with the
Company’s employee stock option plans and employee stock
purchase plan.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cash used for financing activities in 2003 was primarily used:
(i) to repay $1.1 billion of total debt (including
commercial paper), primarily through the redemption of all of
the Company’s $825 million of Puttable Reset
Securities (PURS) and the retirement of $98 million of
Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs), and (ii) to pay
dividends of $332 million. These items were partially
offset by: (i) net proceeds of $556 million from
distributions from Freescale Semiconductor through the cash
management system and (ii) proceeds of $158 million
from the issuance of common stock in connection with the
Company’s employee stock purchase plan and employee stock
option plan.

Short-Term Debt:

At December 31, 2004, the
Company’s outstanding short-term debt was
$717 million, compared to $869 million of outstanding
short-term debt at December 31, 2003. The decrease in
short-term debt during 2004 primarily reflects the repayment, at
maturity, of the $500 million of 6.75% Debentures due
2004, partially offset by the reclassification to current
maturities of $398 million of 6.50% Debentures due
2025 that are puttable in 2005. At December 31, 2004, the
Company had $300 million of outstanding commercial paper,
compared to $304 million outstanding at December 31,
2003. The Company currently expects its outstanding commercial
paper balances to average $300 million throughout 2005.

Long-Term Debt:

At December 31, 2004, the Company
had outstanding long-term debt of $4.6 billion, compared to
$6.7 billion of outstanding long-term debt at
December 31, 2003. This reduction in long-term debt, as
further described below under “Redemptions and Repurchases
of Outstanding Securities in 2004,” consists primarily of:
(i) the redemption of the $1.4 billion aggregate
principal amount outstanding of 2006 Debentures, (ii) the
reclassification to current maturities of $398 million of
6.50% Debentures due 2025 that are puttable in 2005,
(iii) the retirement of $182 million of the
$300 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of 2007
Notes, (iv) the retirement of $110 million of the
$409 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of 2028
Debentures, and (v) the redemption of the $4 million
of Liquid Yield Option Notes due September 7, 2009 (the
“2009 LYONs”) and the Liquid Yield Option Notes due
September 27, 2013 (the “2013 LYONs”) not validly
exchanged for stock.

Remarketing of Senior Note Component of MEUs in August
2004:

In August 2004, pursuant to the terms of the MEUs, the
$1.2 billion of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2007 (the
“2007 MEU Notes”) that comprised a portion of the MEUs
were remarketed to a new set of holders. In connection with the
remarketing, the interest rate on the 2007 MEU Notes was reset
to 4.608%. None of the other terms of the 2007 MEU Notes were
changed. Shortly after the remarketing, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps to change the characteristics of the
interest rate payments from fixed-rate payments to short-term
LIBOR-based variable rate payments.

Redemptions and Repurchases of Outstanding Securities in

$500 Million of TOPrS:

In March 2004, Motorola
Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business trust and
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Trust”),
redeemed all outstanding TOPrS plus accrued interest. In
February 1999, the Trust sold 20 million TOPrS to the
public for an aggregate offering price of $500 million. The
Trust used the proceeds from that sale, together with the
proceeds from its sale of common stock to the Company, to buy a
series of 6.68% Deferrable Interest Junior Subordinated
Debentures due March 31, 2039 (the “Subordinated
Debentures”) from the Company with the same payment terms
as the TOPrS. The sole assets of the Trust were the Subordinated
Debentures. Historically, the TOPrS have been reflected as
“Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely
Company-Guaranteed Debentures” in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. No TOPrS or Subordinated Debentures
remain outstanding.

$4 Million of LYONS:

In March 2004, the Company also
redeemed all outstanding 2009 LYONs and 2013 LYONs. On
March 26, 2004, all then-outstanding 2009 LYONs and 2013
LYONs, not validly exchanged for stock, were redeemed for an
aggregate redemption price of approximately $4 million. No
2009 LYONs or 2013 LYONs remain outstanding.

$500 Million of 6.75% Debentures due 2004:

In
June 2004, the Company repaid, at maturity, all
$500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
6.75% Debentures due 2004.

$182 Million of 7.60% Notes due 2007:

In July
2004, the Company commenced a cash tender offer for any and all
of the $300 million aggregate principal amount outstanding
of its 2007 Notes. The tender offer expired in August 2004 and
an aggregate principal amount of approximately $182 million
of 2007 Notes was validly tendered. In August 2004, the Company
repurchased the validly tendered 2007 Notes for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $202 million. This debt was
repurchased with proceeds distributed to the Company by
Freescale Semiconductor.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

$1.4 Billion of 6.75% Debentures due 2006:

In July
2004, the Company called for the redemption of all
$1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
2006 Debentures. All of the 2006 Debentures were redeemed in
August 2004 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$1.5 billion. This debt was redeemed partially with
proceeds distributed to the Company by Freescale Semiconductor
and partially with available cash balances.

$110 Million of 6.50% Debentures due 2028:

In
August 2004, the Company completed the open market purchase of
$110 million of the $409 million aggregate principal
amount outstanding of its 2028 Debentures. The $110 million
principal amount of 2028 Debentures was purchased for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $115 million.

Given the Company’s cash position, it may from time to time
seek to opportunistically retire certain of its outstanding debt
through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated
transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend
on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

$1.2 Billion of Proceeds from the Sale of Stock Pursuant to
Equity Security Units During 2004:

The Company sold
$1.2 billion of MEUs during the fourth quarter of 2001. In
November 2004, pursuant to the terms of the MEUs the Company
sold 69.4 million shares of common stock for
$1.2 billion to the holders of the MEUs. Pursuant to the
terms of the MEUs, the price per share paid by the holders of
the MEUs was based on the applicable market value of the
Company’s common stock at the purchase date. The purchase
price was $17.30 per share, resulting in the holders purchasing
2.8902 shares of common stock per MEU, for a total of
69.4 million shares.

Credit Ratings:

Three independent credit rating agencies,
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”),
Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”) and
Fitch Investors Service (“Fitch”), assign ratings to
the Company’s short-term and long-term debt.

The following chart reflects the current ratings assigned to the
Company’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term
debt and the Company’s commercial paper by each of these
agencies:

In January 2005, Fitch upgraded the Company’s long-term
debt rating to “BBB+” with a “positive”
outlook from “BBB” with a “positive”
outlook. There was no change in the short-term rating of
“F-2”. In August 2004 S&P changed its outlook on
the Company’s long-term debt to “BBB” with a
“positive” outlook from “BBB” with a
“negative” outlook. There was no change in the
short-term rating of “A-2.” In July 2004, Moody’s
changed its outlook on the Company’s long-term debt to
“Baa3” with a “positive” outlook from
“Baa3” with a “negative” outlook. There was
no change in the short-term rating of “P-3.”

The Company’s debt ratings are considered “investment
grade.” If the Company’s senior long-term debt were
rated lower than “BBB-” by S&P or Fitch or
“Baa3” by Moody’s (which would be a decline of
one level from current Moody’s ratings), the Company’s
long-term debt would no longer be considered “investment
grade.” If this were to occur, the terms on which the
Company could borrow money would become more onerous. The
Company would also have to pay higher fees related to its
domestic revolving credit facility. The Company has never
borrowed under its domestic revolving credit facilities.

The Company continues to have access to the commercial paper and
long-term debt markets. However, the Company generally has had
to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money than it would have
if its credit ratings were higher. The Company has greatly
reduced the amount of its commercial paper outstanding in
comparison to historical levels and has maintained commercial
paper balances of between $300 million and
$500 million for the last 4 years. This reflects the fact
that the market for commercial paper rated “A-2/ P-3/
F-2” is much smaller than that for commercial paper rated
“A-1/ P-1/ F-1” and commercial paper or other
short-term borrowings may be of limited availability to
participants in the “A-2/ P-3/ F-2” market from
time-to-time or for extended periods.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As further described under “Customer Financing
Arrangements” below, for many years the Company has
utilized a receivables program to sell a broadly-diversified
group of short-term receivables, through Motorola Receivables
Corporation (“MRC”), to third parties. The obligations
of the third parties to continue to purchase receivables under
the MRC short-term receivables program could be terminated if
the Company’s long-term debt was rated lower than
“BB+” by S&P or “Ba1” by Moody’s
(which would be a decline of two levels from the current
Moody’s rating). If the MRC short-term receivables program
were terminated, the Company would no longer be able to sell its
short-term receivables in this manner, but it would not have to
repurchase previously-sold receivables.

Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s total domestic and
non-U.S. credit facilities totaled $2.9 billion, of
which $76 million was considered utilized. These facilities
are principally comprised of: (i) a $1.0 billion
three-year revolving domestic credit facility maturing in May
2007 (the “3-Year Credit Facility”) which is not
utilized, and (ii) $1.9 billion of
non-U.S. credit facilities (of which $76 million was
considered utilized at December 31, 2004). The 3-Year
Credit Facility replaced the Company’s former
$700 million 364-day revolving domestic credit facility and
$900 million three-year revolving domestic credit facility.
Unused availability under the existing credit facilities,
together with available cash and cash equivalents and other
sources of liquidity, are generally available to support
outstanding commercial paper, which was $300 million at
December 31, 2004. In order to borrow funds under the
3-Year Credit Facility, the Company must be in compliance with
various conditions, covenants and representations contained in
the agreements. Important terms of the 3-Year Credit Facility
include covenants relating to net interest coverage and total
debt to book capitalization ratios. The Company was in
compliance with the terms of the 3-Year Credit Facility at
December 31, 2004. The Company has never borrowed under its
domestic revolving credit facilities.

Contractual Obligations, Guarantees, and Other Purchase
Commitments

Contractual Obligations

Summarized in the table below are the Company’s obligations
and commitments to make future payments under debt obligations
(assuming earliest possible exercise of put rights by holders),
lease payment obligations, and purchase obligations as of
December 31, 2004.

(1)

Amounts included represent firm, non-cancellable commitments.

Debt Obligations:

At December 31, 2004, the
Company’s long-term debt obligations, including current
maturities and unamortized discount and issue costs, totaled
$5.0 billion, as compared to $7.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. A table of all outstanding long-term
debt securities can be found in Note 4, “Debt and
Credit Facilities,” to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. As previously discussed, the decrease in
the long-term debt obligations as compared to December 31,
2003, was due to the redemptions and repurchases of
approximately $2.2 billion of outstanding securities in
2004.

At December 31, 2004, the Company was in a
$5.4 billion net cash position. The Company’s ratio of
net debt to net debt plus equity was (68.4)% at
December 31, 2004, compared to 0.8% at December 31,
2003. The decrease in this ratio is due to: (i) a
$2.8 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments, (ii) a $2.7 billion decrease
in total debt, and (iii) a $642 million increase in
stockholders’ equity. Total debt is equal to notes payable
and current portion of long-term debt plus long-term debt plus
TOPrS. The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by net debt
plus stockholders’ equity. Net debt is equal to notes
payable and current portion of long-term debt plus long-term
debt plus TOPrS minus cash and cash equivalents minus short-term
investments.

The Company’s management uses the ratio of net debt to net
debt plus equity as one measure of the strength of the
Company’s balance sheet. This ratio is only one of many
possible measures, and investors should analyze the
Company’s financial position and results of operations in
their entirety to reach their own conclusions about the



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Company’s overall financial strength. In addition, the
ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity is measured at a
specific point in time. Since certain of its components, in
particular the Company’s cash balances, are subject to
daily change, investors should recognize that this ratio is
subject to volatility.

The Company expects that from time to time outstanding
commercial paper balances may be replaced with short or
long-term borrowings. Although the Company believes that it can
continue to access the capital markets in 2005 on acceptable
terms and conditions, its flexibility with regard to long-term
financing activity could be limited by: (i) the
Company’s current levels of outstanding long-term debt, and
(ii) the Company’s credit ratings. In addition, many
of the factors that affect the Company’s ability to access
the capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall
capital markets and the current state of the economy, in
particular the telecommunications industry, are outside of the
Company’s control. There can be no assurances that the
Company will continue to have access to the capital markets on
favorable terms.

Lease Obligations:

The Company owns most of its major
facilities, but does lease certain office, factory and warehouse
space, land, and information technology and other equipment
under principally non-cancelable operating leases. At
December 31, 2004, future minimum lease obligations, net of
minimum sublease rentals, totaled $836 million. Rental
expense, net of sublease income, was $217 million in 2004,
$223 million in 2003 and $218 million in 2002.

Purchase Obligations:

The Company has entered into
agreements for the purchase of inventory, license of software,
promotional agreements, and research and development agreements
which are firm commitments and are not cancelable. The longest
of these agreements extends through 2008. Total payments
expected to be made under these agreements total
$207 million.

Commitments Under Other Long-Term Agreements:

The Company
has entered into certain agreements to purchase components,
supplies and materials from suppliers. Most of the agreements
extend for periods of one to three years, however, generally
these contracts can be terminated by either the Company or the
supplier with 60 to 90 days notice. If the Company were to
terminate these agreements, it would generally be liable for
forecasted purchases between the termination notification date
and the termination date of the agreements. The Company’s
liability would only arise in the event it terminates the
agreements for reasons other than cause.

In 2003, the Company entered into outsourcing contracts for
certain corporate functions, such as benefit administration and
information technology related services. These contracts
generally extend for 10 years and are expected to expire in
2013. The total payments under these contracts are approximately
$3 billion over 10 years; however, these contracts can
be terminated. Termination would result in a penalty
substantially less than the annual contract payments. The
Company would also be required to find another source for these
services, including the possibility of performing them in-house.

As is customary in bidding for and completing network
infrastructure projects and pursuant to a practice the Company
has followed for many years, the Company has a number of
performance/bid bonds and standby letters of credit outstanding,
primarily relating to projects of CGISS and GTSS. These
instruments normally have maturities of up to three years and
are standard in the industry as a way to give customers a
convenient mechanism to seek resolution if a contractor does not
satisfy performance requirements under a contract. A customer
can draw on the instrument only if the Company does not fulfill
all terms of a project contract. If such an occasion occurred,
the Company would be obligated to reimburse the financial
institution that issued the bond or letter of credit for the
amounts paid. The Company is not generally required to post any
cash in connection with the issuance of these bonds or letters
of credit. In its long history, it has been extraordinarily
uncommon for the Company to have a performance/bid bond or
standby letter of credit drawn upon. At December 31, 2004,
outstanding performance/bid bonds and standby letters of credit
totaled approximately $1.0 billion, compared to
$1.3 billion at the end of 2003.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

Under the definition
contained in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, the Company
does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Adequate Internal and External Funding Resources:

The
Company believes that it has adequate internal and external
resources available to fund expected working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for the next twelve months as supported
by the level of cash and cash equivalents in the U.S., the
ability to repatriate cash and cash equivalents from foreign
jurisdictions, the ability to borrow under existing or future
credit facilities, the ability to issue commercial paper, access
to the short-term and long-term debt markets, and proceeds from
sales of available-for-sale securities and other investments.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Customer Financing Commitments and Guarantees

Outstanding Commitments:

Certain purchasers of the
Company’s infrastructure equipment continue to request that
suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment
purchases. Financing may include all or a portion of the
purchase price of the equipment as well as working capital. The
Company had outstanding commitments to extend credit to third
parties totaling $294 million at December 31, 2004,
compared to $149 million at December 31, 2003. During
2004, the Company made loans to customers of $25 million,
as compared to loans to customers of $32 million during
2003.

Guarantees of Third-Party Debt:

In addition to providing
direct financing to certain equipment customers, the Company
also assists customers in obtaining financing directly from
banks and other sources to fund equipment purchases. The amount
of loans from third parties for which the Company has committed
to provide financial guarantees totaled $8 million at
December 31, 2004, as compared to $10 million at
December 31, 2003. No payments were made pursuant to
guarantees during 2004, compared to payments of $28 million
made during 2003. Customer borrowings outstanding under these
third-party loan arrangements were $4 million at
December 31, 2004, as compared to $10 million at
December 31, 2003.

The Company evaluates its contingent obligations under these
financial guarantees by assessing the customer’s financial
status, account activity and credit risk, as well as the current
economic conditions and historical experience. The
$8 million of guarantees discussed above are to four
customers and are scheduled to expire in 2013. The Company had
no accrued liabilities recorded at December 31, 2004 and
$1 million at 2003 to reflect management’s best
estimate of probable losses of unrecoverable amounts, should
these guarantees be called.

Customer Financing Arrangements

Outstanding Finance Receivables:

The Company had net
finance receivables of $170 million at December 31,
2004, compared to $301 million at December 31, 2003
(net of allowances for losses of $2.0 billion at
December 31, 2004 and $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2003). These finance receivables are generally
interest bearing, with rates ranging from 3% to 12%. Total
interest income recognized on finance receivables was
$9 million in 2004, compared to $18 million in 2003
and $28 million in 2002.

Telsim Loan:

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company had $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion,
respectively, of gross receivables from one customer, Telsim, in
Turkey (the “Telsim Loan”) with the decline
representing partial recovery of amounts owed of
$44 million due to collection efforts during 2004. As a
result of difficulties in collecting the amounts due from
Telsim, the Company has previously recorded charges reducing the
net receivable from Telsim to zero. At both December 31,
2004 and 2003, the net receivable from Telsim was zero. Although
the Company continues to vigorously pursue its recovery efforts,
it believes the litigation, collection and/or settlement process
will be very lengthy in light of the Uzans’ (the family
which previously controlled Telsim) continued resistance to
satisfy the judgment against them and their decision to violate
various courts’ orders, including orders holding them in
contempt of court. In addition, the Turkish government has
asserted control over Telsim and certain other interests of the
Uzans and this may make the Company’s collection efforts
more difficult.

Sales of Receivables and Loans:

From time to time, the
Company sells short-term receivables and long-term loans to
third parties in transactions that qualify as
“true-sales.” Certain of these receivables are sold
through a separate legal entity, Motorola Receivables
Corporation (“MRC”). The financial results for MRC are
fully consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.
This receivables funding program is administered through
multi-seller commercial paper conduits. Under FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (revised), the Company is not required
to consolidate those entities.

The Company sells short-term receivables through the Motorola
Receivables Corporation (“MRC”) short-term receivables
program, which provides for up to $425 million of
short-term receivables to be outstanding with third parties at
any time. In October 2004, the Company renewed the MRC
short-term receivables program at its current level for one
year. In addition, the Company sells short-term receivables
directly to third parties. Total short-term receivables sold by
the Company (including those sold directly to third parties and
those sold through the MRC short-term receivables program) were
$3.8 billion in 2004, compared to $2.7 billion in 2003
and $2.9 billion in 2002. There were $1.1 billion and
$771 million of short-term receivables outstanding under
these arrangements at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively (including $255 million and $170 million,
respectively, under the MRC program). Under the MRC short-term
receivables program, 90% of the value of the receivables sold is
covered by credit insurance obtained from independent insurance
companies. The credit exposure on the remaining 10% is covered
by a retained interest in the sold receivables. The
Company’s total credit exposure to



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

outstanding short-term receivables that have been sold was
$25 million at both December 31, 2004 and 2003 with
reserves of $4 million and $13 million recorded for
potential losses on this exposure at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Other Contingencies

Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying
Contract Value:

In certain circumstances, our businesses may
enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the
damages that could be claimed by the other party for failed
performance might exceed the revenue the Company receives from
the contract. Contracts with these sorts of uncapped damage
provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still
represent meaningful risk. Although it has not previously
happened to the Company, there is a possibility that a damage
claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result
in expenses to the Company that are far in excess of the revenue
received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.

Legal Matters:

The Company has several lawsuits filed
against it relating to the Iridium program, as further described
under “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” of this
document. The Company has not reserved for any potential
liability that may arise as a result of litigation related to
the Iridium program. While the still pending cases are in very
preliminary stages and the outcomes are not predictable, an
unfavorable outcome of one or more of these cases could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

The Company is a defendant in various other lawsuits, including
product-related suits, and is subject to various claims which
arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of
management, and other than discussed above with respect to the
still pending Iridium cases, the ultimate disposition of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Segment Information

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the
financial results of each reporting segment as detailed in
Note 10, “Information by Segment and Geographic
Region,” to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Net sales and operating results for the Company’s major
operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are presented below.

In April 2004, the Company separated its semiconductor
operations into a separate subsidiary, Freescale Semiconductor,
Inc. (“Freescale Semiconductor”). In July 2004, an
initial public offering of a minority interest of approximately
32.5% of Freescale Semiconductor was completed. On
December 2, 2004, Motorola completed the spin-off of
Freescale Semiconductor from the Company by distributing its
remaining 67.5% equity interest in Freescale Semiconductor to
Motorola shareholders. As of that date, Freescale Semiconductor
is an entirely independent company. The financial results of
Freescale Semiconductor have been presented in Motorola’s
consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation.

Personal Communications Segment

The Personal Communications segment (“PCS”) designs,
manufactures, sells and services wireless handsets with
integrated software and accessory products. In 2004, PCS’s
net sales represented 54% of the Company’s consolidated net
sales, compared to 47% in 2003 and 48% in 2002.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 53% to
$16.8 billion, compared to $11.0 billion in 2003. The
53% increase in net sales in 2004 was driven by increases in
both unit shipments and average selling price (“ASP”)



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

compared to 2003, and reflects strong consumer demand for new
products, particularly GSM and 3G handsets. The strong demand
for these new handsets was reflected by increased net sales in
all regions, driven by an improved product portfolio, strong
market growth in the emerging markets, and high replacement
sales in the more mature markets.

The segment’s backlog was $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. The decline in backlog was driven
primarily by the segment’s improved ability to meet demand
for new products in a more timely manner. In addition, the
backlog at December 31, 2003 was unusually high due to the
impact of a key component supply constraint that resulted in the
segment’s inability to meet the demand for certain new
products in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Unit shipments in 2004 increased 39% to 104.5 million,
compared to 75.3 million in 2003. For the full year 2004, a
record year for the handset industry, the segment believes total
industry unit shipments (also referred to as industry
“sell-in”) increased approximately 25% compared to
2003. Since the segment’s unit shipment growth outpaced the
industry, the segment believes it increased overall market share
in 2004 compared to 2003, and solidified its hold on the
second-largest worldwide market share of wireless handsets.

Also contributing to the increase in net sales was the
improvement in the segment’s ASP, which increased
approximately 15% in 2004 compared to 2003. The overall increase
in ASP was driven primarily by a shift in product mix towards
higher-tier handsets, which included the introduction of several
3G UMTS handsets and the iconic RAZR. By comparison, ASP
declined approximately 8% in 2003 and 5% in 2002. ASP is
impacted by factors such as product mix and pricing, as well as
market conditions and competitive product offerings. ASP trends
over time can vary as market conditions and competition drive
changes to these various factors.

A few customers represent a significant portion of the
segment’s net sales. During 2004, purchases of iDEN
products by Nextel Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”)and
its affiliates comprised approximately 14% of the segment’s
net sales, compared to 18% in 2003. We have been the sole
supplier of iDEN handsets and core network infrastructure
equipment to Nextel for over ten years. Nextel uses
Motorola’s proprietary iDEN technology to support its
nationwide wireless service business. In December 2004, Motorola
announced that it reached an agreement with Nextel to extend the
companies’ iDEN infrastructure and iDEN subscriber supply
agreements for a period from January 1, 2005 through
December 31, 2007. Motorola also announced an agreement
with Nextel for implementation of Next Generation Dispatch, a
new Internet Protocol-based call processing engine designed to
replace the current call-processing system. In addition,
Motorola has developed a new 6:1 vocoder which will allow Nextel
to increase capacity on its current system. Nextel has announced
its intention to activate the 6:1 vocoder in substantially all
of its markets in 2005. In December 2004, Nextel and Sprint
Corp. (“Sprint”) announced their intention to merge
their two companies. The segment does not anticipate any
significant impact to its business in 2005 as compared to 2004
as a result of this merger.

In addition to Nextel, the largest of our end customers include
Cingular, China Mobile and Vodafone. Besides selling directly to
carriers and operators, the segment also sells products through
a variety of third-party distributors and retailers, which
account for approximately 30% of the segment’s net sales.
The largest of these distributors represented approximately 5%
of the segment’s net sales in 2004 and is our primary
distributor in Latin America. The loss of any of the
segment’s major customers could have a significant impact
on the segment’s business. Although the U.S. market
continued to be the segment’s largest market, sales into
non-U.S. markets represented approximately 60% of the
segment’s total net sales in 2004, compared to 52% in 2003.
The largest of these international markets are China, the United
Kingdom and Brazil. In North America, the industry saw
consolidation of some major telecommunications carriers in 2004,
involving some of the segment’s largest customers. However,
the segment did not see any significant impact on their business
in 2004 due to these consolidations, nor do they foresee any
significant impact from these consolidations in the future.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$1.7 billion in 2004, compared to operating earnings of
$479 million in 2003. The 257% increase in operating
earnings was primarily related to an increase in gross margin,
which was due to: (i) the 53% increase in net sales, and
(ii) ongoing cost-reduction activities and improvements in
the segment’s supply chain. Also contributing to the
increase in operating earnings was a decrease in reorganization
of business charges, primarily due to: (i) charges recorded
in 2003 for employee severance and exit costs which were
primarily related to the exit of certain manufacturing
activities in Flensburg, Germany, and (ii) reversals of
accruals recorded in 2004 that were related to accruals for exit
costs and employee severance which were no longer needed. These
improvements to operating results were partially offset by:
(i) an increase in SG&A expenditures, reflecting an
increase in employee incentive program accruals and increased
advertising, promotion and marketing expenditures to support
higher sales and brand awareness, and (ii) an increase in
R&D expenditures, primarily



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

reflecting increased developmental engineering expenditures due
to additional investment in new product development. The
segment’s industry typically experiences short life cycles
for new products and, therefore, it is vital to the
segment’s success that new, compelling products are
constantly introduced. Accordingly, a strong commitment to
R&D is required to fuel long-term growth.

Segment Results—2003 Compared to 2002

In 2003, the segment’s net sales decreased 2% to
$11.0 billion, compared to $11.2 billion in 2002. The
2% decrease in net sales in 2003 reflected the interaction of a
number of factors. In the fourth quarter of 2003, traditionally
the segment’s highest sales quarter, the segment was unable
to meet demand for shipments of certain products, primarily
those featuring integrated cameras, due to supply constraints
for a key component. This had an adverse effect on fourth
quarter net sales, which were down 3% from the fourth quarter of
2002. As further discussed below, the segment’s net sales
in Asia decreased 42% in 2003, due to ongoing intense
competition in that region, particularly in China, and the
impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (“SARS”)
during the first half of the year. Also, in 2002, the segment
discontinued sales of paging products. The 2002 results included
$176 million of net sales of paging products, while 2003
did not include paging product sales.

The segment’s backlog was $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2003, compared to $1.1 billion at
December 31, 2002. Backlog increased primarily as a result
of demand for new products that were introduced in the second
half of 2003, including handsets with integrated cameras.
Backlog was also impacted by the component supply constraints,
which resulted in the segment’s inability to meet the
demand for certain new products in the fourth quarter
of 2003.

For the full year 2003, the segment believes total industry unit
shipments (also referred to as industry “sell-in”)
increased approximately 20% compared to 2002. This growth was
higher than expected by most industry analysts. Unfortunately,
the growth in unit shipments in the segment lagged behind the
unit growth in the overall industry, as unit shipments for the
segment grew by only 7% in 2003 compared to 2002.
Correspondingly, the segment’s market share is estimated to
have declined in 2003.

The 7% increase in unit shipments by the segment was offset by a
decrease in the segment’s ASP, which declined 8% on an
annual basis in 2003. For comparison, the decline in ASP for the
segment was 5% in 2002 and 12% in 2001. The overall decline in
ASP in 2003 was caused primarily by: (i) a shift in product
mix, particularly during the first half of the year, toward
lower-priced handsets, (ii) the intense competition from
new and existing handset manufacturers in the Asian market, and
(iii) unusually high sales of end-of-life products in the
third quarter of 2003, reflecting the segment’s aggressive
steps to sell aging inventory. During the second half of 2003,
the segment introduced several feature-rich, higher-tier
products, with features including cameras, large color displays,
expanded software applications, messaging functionality,
advanced gaming features and an increased opportunity for
personalization. These products began to ship in volume during
the fourth quarter of 2003 and, as a result, there was a
sequential increase in ASP from the third quarter to the fourth
quarter in 2003.

A few customers represented a significant portion of the
segment’s net sales in 2003. During 2003, purchases of iDEN
products by Nextel comprised approximately 18% of the
segment’s net sales, compared to 15% in 2002. In addition,
approximately 9% of the segment’s net sales were to the
China market and were primarily used on mobile systems operated
by China Mobile and China Unicom, the two largest wireless
operators in China. In 2003, although the U.S. market
continued to be the segment’s largest market, sales into
non-U.S. markets represented more than half of the
segment’s total revenue.

The segment’s operating earnings in 2003 were
$479 million, compared to operating earnings of
$503 million in 2002. The 5% decline in operating earnings
was primarily related to: (i) a decline in gross margin,
and (ii) an increase in research and development (R&D)
expenditures, partially offset by: (i) a decrease in
reorganization of business and other charges, and (ii) a
decrease in SG&A expenditures. The decline in gross margin
primarily reflects the $196 million decline in net sales,
which was driven by the 8% decline in ASP and the loss of sales
from the exited paging business. These negative influences were
partially offset by a decrease in certain manufacturing costs
due to benefits from prior and ongoing cost-reduction actions
and supply-chain efficiencies. The increase in R&D
expenditures reflects an increase in developmental engineering
expenditures due to the number of new product offerings by the
segment. The segment’s industry typically experiences short
life cycles for new products and, therefore, it is vital to the
segment’s success that new, compelling products are
constantly introduced. Accordingly, a strong commitment to
R&D is required to fuel long-term growth. The decrease in
SG&A expenditures reflects a decline in overall
administrative and general spending, which was driven by
benefits from prior and ongoing cost-

reduction efforts, as well as the absence of charges that
occurred in 2002 related to the discontinuance of paging
products.

For the full year 2003, the segment recorded net charges of
$51 million related to reorganization of business and other
charges. These charges primarily consisted of:
(i) $43 million in net charges related to employee
severance, mainly related to the planned exit of certain
manufacturing activities in Flensburg, Germany, engineering site
optimizations, and segment-wide employee severance programs,
partially offset by reversals of accruals no longer needed,
primarily related to the exit of the Harvard, Illinois facility,
and (ii) $7 million in exit costs related to the
planned exit of certain manufacturing activities in Flensburg,
Germany.

For the full year 2002, the segment recorded net charges of
$301 million related to reorganization of business and
other charges. These charges primarily consisted of: (i) a
$119 million net charge for fixed asset impairments,
primarily relating to implementation of a plan to close an
engineering and distribution center in Harvard, Illinois,
(ii) a $125 million charge for the segment’s
share of a potentially uncollectible finance receivable from
Telsim, and (iii) a $70 million net charge related to
segment-wide employee severance costs.

Global Telecom Solutions Segment

The Global Telecom Solutions segment (“GTSS”) designs,
manufactures, sells, installs, and services wireless
infrastructure communication systems, including hardware and
software. GTSS provides end-to-end wireless networks, including
radio base stations, base site controllers, associated software
and services, mobility soft switching, application platforms and
third-party switching for CDMA, GSM, iDEN® and UMTS. In
2004, GTSS’s net sales represented 17% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales, compared to 19% in 2003
and 20% in 2002.

*** Percent change not meaningful

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 24% to
$5.5 billion, compared to $4.4 billion in 2003. The
24% increase in net sales in 2004 was driven by an increase in
spending by the segment’s wireless service provider
customers and reflects increased net sales in both the
segment’s mature and emerging markets. The segment
continues to increase its presence in emerging markets, which
the segment believes are growing faster than the industry as a
whole. Net sales growth occurred in all technologies and in all
regions. Sales into non-U.S. markets increased in 2004 and
represented approximately 66% of the segment’s total net
sales in 2004, compared to approximately 63% in 2003. The
segment’s backlog was $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $1.6 billion at
December 31, 2003.

The wireless infrastructure industry experienced significant
growth in 2004 after three years of decline. The segment
believes that its 24% increase in net sales outpaced overall
sales growth in the industry, and resulted in increased market
share for the segment in 2004.

The nature of the segment’s business is long-term contracts
with major operators that require sizeable investments by its
customers. In 2004, five customers— China Mobile; China
Unicom; KDDI, a service provider in Japan; Nextel; and
Verizon— represented approximately 54% of the
segment’s net sales. The loss of one of these major
customers could have a significant impact on the segment’s
business and, because contracts are long-term, could impact
revenue and earnings over several quarters.

Nextel is the segment’s largest customer, representing 17%
of the segment’s net sales in 2004, and we have been the
sole supplier of iDEN handsets and core network infrastructure
equipment to Nextel for over ten years. Nextel uses
Motorola’s proprietary iDEN technology to support its
nationwide wireless service business. In December 2004, Motorola
announced that it reached an agreement with Nextel to extend the
companies iDEN infrastructure and iDEN subscriber supply
agreements for a period from January 1, 2005 through
December 31, 2007. Motorola also announced an agreement
with Nextel for implementation of Next Generation Dispatch, a
new Internet Protocol-based call processing engine designed to
replace the current call-processing system. In addition,
Motorola has developed a new 6:1 vocoder which will allow Nextel
to increase capacity on its current system.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Nextel has announced its intention to activate the 6:1 vocoder
in substantially all of its markets in 2005. In December 2004,
Nextel and Sprint announced their intention to merge their two
companies. The segment does not anticipate any significant
impact to its business in 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result
of this merger.

KDDI has been successful with its all-Motorola 800MHZ CDMA2000
1X network in Japan. In 2004, Motorola and KDDI began deployment
of a CDMA2000 1X network in the 2GHZ band. This new packet-based
2GHz network is expected to allow KDDI to provide more advanced
features and expand its subscriber base.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$759 million in 2004, compared to operating earnings of
$247 million in 2003. The 207% increase in operating
earnings was primarily related to an increase in gross margin,
which was due to: (i) the 24% increase in net sales, and
(ii) continued cost containment in the segment’s
supply chain. The improvements in operating results were
partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenditures,
primarily due to: (i) an increase in employee incentive
program accruals, and (ii) increased selling and sales
support expenditures, primarily attributable to the 24% increase
in net sales. R&D expenditures remained relatively flat in
2004 compared to 2003, reflecting benefits from improved
efficiencies in development engineering.

The segment continues to build on its industry-leading position
in push-to-talk over cellular (“PoC”) technology. To
date, the segment has 23 contracts in 27 countries. These
contracts offer PoC solutions for both CDMA2000 and GSM/ GPRS
networks.

Segment Results—2003 Compared to 2002

In 2003, the segment’s net sales decreased 4% to
$4.4 billion, compared to $4.6 billion in 2002. The
segment’s backlog was $1.6 billion at
December 31, 2003, compared to $1.2 billion at
December 31, 2002.

The 4% decrease in net sales in 2003 was primarily due to the
continued reduction in capital spending by cellular operators,
primarily in mature markets. In U.S. dollars, this sales
decline was roughly in line with the overall sales decline in
the wireless infrastructure industry. Operators spent less on
new equipment because of pressure to reduce costs and declines
in average revenue per user. In addition, technology
enhancements greatly improved network capacity without
necessitating corresponding increases in spending by the
operators. However, unlike the case in mature markets, many
existing operators in emerging markets increased spending on
wireless infrastructure and services during 2003. During 2003,
the segment established a market presence in the emerging
markets, many of which have higher growth rates than those of
mature markets.

The nature of the segment’s business is long-term contracts
with major operators that require sizeable investments by its
customers. In 2003, five customers— China Mobile
Communications Corporation; China Unicom; KDDI, a service
provider in Japan; Nextel and its affiliates and Verizon—
represented approximately 55% of the segment’s net sales.
The loss of one of these major customers could have a
significant impact on the segment’s business and, because
contracts are long-term, could impact revenue and earnings over
several quarters.

The segment reported operating earnings of $247 million in
2003, compared to an operating loss of $621 million in
2002. The improvement in operating results was primarily related
to: (i) a decrease in reorganization of business and other
charges, (ii) a decrease in R&D expenditures,
reflecting cost savings from prior cost-reduction actions,
(iii) a decrease in SG&A expenditures, primarily
selling and sales support costs, reflecting cost savings from
prior cost-reduction actions, partially offset by an increase in
employee incentive program costs, and (iv) an increase in
gross margin, primarily due to benefits from prior
cost-reduction actions and a reduction in reorganization of
business charges included in costs of sales, partially offset by
the 4% decline in net sales.

For the full year 2003, the segment recorded net income of
$13 million related to reorganization of business and other
charges. The net income primarily consisted of a net reduction
of $39 million in accruals for reorganization of business
costs that were no longer needed, partially offset by a
$32 million charge for in-process research and development
related to the acquisition of Winphoria Networks, Inc.

For the full year 2002, the segment recorded net charges of
$610 million related to reorganization of business and
other charges, which primarily consisted of: (i) a
$401 million charge for the segment’s share of a
potentially uncollectible finance receivable from Telsim,
(ii) a $128 million net charge for segment-wide
employee severance costs, and (iii) a $55 million
charge for exit costs related to a lease cancellation.

Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions Segment

The Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions segment
(“CGISS”) designs, manufactures, sells, installs and
services analog and digital two-way radio, voice and data
communications products and systems to a wide range of
public-safety, government, utility, courier, transportation and
other worldwide markets. The business continues to invest in the
market for broadband data, including infrastructure, devices,
service and applications. In addition, the segment participates
in the expanding market for integrated information management,
mobile and biometric applications and services. In 2004,
CGISS’s net sales represented 15% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales, compared to 18% in 2003 and 16% in 2002.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 11% to
$4.6 billion, compared to $4.1 billion in 2003. The
increase in net sales reflects continued emphasis on spending by
customers in the segment’s government market, primarily in
response to homeland security initiatives, as well as increased
spending by the segment’s enterprise customers on
business-critical communications needs. The overall increase in
net sales reflects net sales growth in all regions. Net sales in
North America continue to comprise a significant portion of the
segment’s business, accounting for 66% of the
segment’s net sales in both 2004 and 2003. The
segment’s backlog was $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $1.7 billion at
December 31, 2003. The increase in backlog was driven by
the awarding of large, multi-year projects in the segment’s
government market during the latter half of 2004.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$753 million in 2004, compared to operating earnings of
$562 million in 2003. The 34% increase in operating
earnings was primarily due to: (i) the 11% increase in net
sales, (ii) cost savings from supply-chain efficiencies,
and (iii) overall cost structure improvements. Also
contributing to the increase in operating earnings was a
decrease in reorganization of business charges, primarily due to
a decrease in charges related to segment-wide employee
severance. These improvements in operating results were
partially offset by: (i) an increase in SG&A
expenditures, primarily due to an increase in employee incentive
program accruals and an increase in selling and sales support
expenditures, due primarily to the 11% increase in net sales,
(ii) an increase in R&D expenditures driven by
increased investment in new technologies, and
(iii) $17 million of in-process research and
development charges related to the acquisitions of MeshNetworks,
Inc. (“MeshNetworks”) and CRISNET, Inc.
(“CRISNET”)

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company completed the
acquisitions of MeshNetworks and CRISNET. MeshNetworks is a
leading developer of mobile mesh networking and
position-location technologies. The technologies make it
possible to deploy high-performance Internet Protocol-based
wireless networks. The acquisition supports Motorola’s
seamless mobility vision and will strengthen the solution
portfolio for wireless broadband customers. CRISNET has a suite
of advanced software applications for law enforcement, justice
and public safety agencies. This group of products will enable
Motorola to build upon its customer and technology leadership in
the public safety market.

Spending by the segment’s government and public safety
customers is affected by government budgets at the national,
state and local levels. In the U.S., where the majority of the
segments sales occur, the 2005 Department of Homeland Security
Appropriations Act was passed in October 2004, providing for an
increase over 2004’s discretionary spending budget.
However, it is very difficult to tell how much of that funding
will be used for communications needs. Also, recent U.S. federal
government budget proposals have indicated potential funding
reductions to state and local agencies that purchase our
products and systems. In addition, even in light of limited
budgets for local governments and public safety agencies, the
segment sees increased prioritization of limited government
funds towards funding of safety and security projects.
Particularly, customers in the government market are interested
in two-way radio systems and integrated solutions that enhance
interoperability and compatibility. Accordingly, the segment
does not expect reductions in U.S. federal government funding to
state and local agencies to have a material impact on its
business in 2005. The segment will continue to work closely with
all pertinent government departments and agencies to ensure that
two-way radio and wireless communications is positioned as a
critical need for homeland security.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The scope and size of systems requested by some of the
segment’s customers are increasing, including requests for
country-wide and statewide systems. These larger systems are
more complex and include a wide range of capabilities.
Large-system projects will impact how contracts are bid, which
companies compete for bids and how companies partner on projects.

The segment was awarded a number of major, multi-year contracts
in 2004, including: (i) a $329 million contract with
the Commonwealth of Virginia for a sophisticated digital voice
and wireless data communications system, (ii) a
$294 million contract to provide the U.S. Postal Service
with data communications capability, and (iii) a contract
with the Austrian Ministry of Interior to provide a
mission-critical, country-wide TETRA public safety digital radio
network.

Segment Results—2003 Compared to 2002

In 2003, the segment’s net sales increased 10% to
$4.1 billion, compared to $3.7 billion in 2002. The
segment’s backlog was $1.7 billion at both
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. The increase
in net sales was primarily due to increased spending by
customers in the segment’s government market, primarily due
to homeland security initiatives. Net sales were also increased
by contracts relating to the conflict in the Middle East and the
reconstruction of public safety systems in Iraq. In 2003,
$2.7 billion, or 66% of the segment’s net sales, were
in North America, as compared to $2.4 billion, or 65% of
the segment’s net sales, in 2002.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$562 million in 2003, compared to operating earnings of
$313 million in 2002. The increase in operating earnings
was primarily related to: (i) an increase in gross margin,
primarily due to: (a) the 10% increase in net sales,
(b) a favorable product mix, reflecting a higher proportion
of sales of subscriber equipment and a lower proportion of sales
of infrastructure equipment, and (c) continued benefits
from prior cost-reduction actions, and (ii) a decrease in
reorganization of business charges, primarily due to a decrease
in charges related to segment-wide employee severance. These
improvements in operating earnings were partially offset by:
(i) an increase in SG&A expenditures due to an increase
in employee incentive program accruals, and (ii) an
increase in R&D expenditures. Although both SG&A and
R&D expenditures increased, SG&A and R&D
expenditures as a percent of net sales decreased in 2003
compared to 2002.

Integrated Electronic Systems Segment

The Integrated Electronic Systems segment (“IESS”)
designs, manufactures and sells: (i) automotive and
industrial electronics systems, (ii) telematics systems
that enable automated roadside assistance, navigation and
advanced safety features for automobiles, (iii) portable
energy storage products and systems, and (iv) embedded
computing systems. In 2004, IESS’s net sales represented 9%
of the Company’s consolidated net sales, compared to 10% in
2003 and 9% in 2002.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 19% to
$2.7 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in 2003. The
increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales in
the Automotive Communications and Electronic Systems Group
(“ACES”), and additional sales resulting from the
acquisition of Force Computers in August 2004. The
segment’s backlog was $424 million at
December 31, 2004, compared to $347 million at
December 31, 2003. The increase in backlog was driven by
increased demand in all three primary business groups.

The three primary business groups within the segment are:
(i) ACES, which sells automotive and industrial electronics
systems, including telematics, (ii) the Energy Systems
Group (“ESG”), which sells portable energy storage
products and systems, and (iii) the Embedded Communications
Computing Group (“ECCG”), which sells embedded
computing systems. As stated below, ECCG consists of the former
Motorola Computer Group (“MCG”) and recently-acquired
Force Computers. In 2004, ACES, ESG and ECCG represented 62%,
22% and 16% of the segment’s net sales, respectively. In
2003, ACES, ESG, and ECCG represented 64%, 23% and 13% of the
segment’s net sales, respectively.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In ACES, demand is linked to automobile sales in the U.S. and
other countries, as well as the level of electronic content per
vehicle. For 2004 compared to 2003, ACES’s net sales
increased 15%, primarily due to the success of telematics
products, as well as electronic control products launched during
the year.

In ESG, demand is strongly linked to the sales of other Motorola
businesses, particularly the sales of the wireless handset
business, which is the group’s largest customer. For 2004
compared to 2003, ESG’s net sales increased 17%, primarily
due to the increased demand from the Company’s wireless
handset business, and the increased demand in the wireless
handset industry.

In ECCG, demand is strongly linked to sales of
telecommunications, manufacturing, imaging and other
infrastructure systems in the U.S. and other countries. For 2004
compared to 2003, ECCG’s net sales increased 39%,
reflecting increased demand for integrated, standards-based
embedded computing systems, and additional sales from the
acquisition of Force Computers.

A large part of the segment’s business is dependent upon
other Motorola businesses, primarily the wireless handset
business, and three external automotive
manufacturers—General Motors, Daimler Chrysler and Ford.
Sales to other Motorola businesses accounted for 19% of the
segment’s net sales in 2004, as compared to 18% in 2003.
The net sales to General Motors, Ford and Daimler Chrysler were
17%, 12% and 12% of the segment’s 2004 net sales,
respectively. The loss of one of these major customers could
have a significant impact on the segment’s business.

In August 2004, the Company acquired Force Computers, a
worldwide designer and supplier of open, standards-based and
custom embedded computing solutions. The results of operations
of Force Computers were integrated with MCG, and the two
combined entities were renamed the Embedded Communications
Computing Group. This acquisition is expected to enable ECCG to
provide solutions for a wider range of customer application
needs, supported by a broader portfolio of boards, systems and
services.

The segment reported operating earnings of $142 million in
2004, compared to operating earnings of $161 million in
2003. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily related
to: (i) an increase in SG&A expenditures, primarily due
to an increase in employee incentive program accruals and
expenses related to the addition of Force Computers.
(ii) an increase in R&D expenditures, primarily to
support substantial new business wins across the segment and the
addition of Force Computers, (iii) an increase in
reorganization of business charges due to an increase in
employee severance costs, and (iv) $2 million in
charges for in-process research and development related to the
acquisition of Force Computers. Although R&D expenditures
increased in 2004 compared to 2003, R&D expenditures
decreased as percentage of net sales. These decreases in
operating results were partially offset by an increase in gross
margin, driven by the 19% increase in net sales.

Segment Results—2003 Compared to 2002

In 2003, the segment’s net sales increased 3% to
$2.3 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in 2002. The
segment’s backlog was $347 million at
December 31, 2003, compared to $308 million at
December 31, 2002.

In 2003, ACES, ESG and ECCG represented 64%, 23% and 13% of the
segment’s net sales, respectively. In 2002, ACES, ESG, and
ECCG represented 60%, 28% and 12% of the segment’s net
sales, respectively.

In 2003 compared to 2002, ACES’s net sales increased 9%,
primarily due to the success of several new electronic controls
and telematics products launched during the year. ESG’s net
sales decreased 15%, primarily due to reductions in the price of
batteries for wireless handsets. ECCG’s net sales increased
17%, reflecting increased demand for commercial, off-the-shelf
embedded computing applications.

A large part of the segment’s business in 2003 was
dependent upon other Motorola businesses, primarily the wireless
handset business, and three external automotive
manufacturers—General Motors, Ford and Daimler Chrysler.
Sales to other Motorola businesses accounted for 18% of the
segment’s net sales in 2003, as compared to 19% in 2002.
The net sales to General Motors, Ford and Daimler Chrysler were
17%, 15% and 13% of the segment’s 2003 net sales,
respectively.

The segment reported operating earnings of $161 million in
2003, compared to operating earnings of $52 million in
2002. The improvement in operating results was primarily related
to: (i) a decrease in SG&A expenditures, driven by a
reduction in general and administrative expenses, reflecting
benefits from prior cost-reduction actions, (ii) a
reduction in reorganization of business and other charges, and
(iii) an increase in gross margin, reflecting the 3%
increase in net sales and a reduction in reorganization of
business charges included in



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

costs of sales. These improvements were partially offset by an
increase in R&D expenditures, primarily due to a reduction
in customer-funded R&D.

In 2003, the segment recorded net income of $1 million
related to reorganization of businesses and other charges. This
income consisted of a net reversal of $1 million in
accruals for exit costs that were no longer needed.

In 2002, the segment recorded net charges of $58 million
related to reorganization of businesses and other charges. These
charges primarily consisted of: (i) a $24 million net
charge for exit costs, (ii) a $23 million net charge
for fixed asset impairments, and (iii) a $20 million
net charge for segment-wide employee separation costs, partially
offset by a reversal of accruals no longer needed.

Broadband Communications Segment

The Broadband Communications segment (“BCS”) designs,
manufactures and sells a wide variety of broadband products,
including: (i) digital systems and set-top terminals for
cable television and broadcast networks, (ii) high speed
data products, including cable modems and cable modem
termination systems, as well as Internet Protocol-based
telephony products, (iii) access network technology,
including hybrid fiber coaxial network transmission systems and
fiber-to-the-premise (“FTTP”) transmission systems,
used by cable television operators, (iv) digital satellite
television systems, (v) direct-to-home satellite networks
and private networks for business communications, and
(vi) high-speed data, video and voice broadband systems
over existing phone lines. In 2004, BCS net sales represented 7%
of the Company’s consolidated net sales, compared to 8% in
2003 and 9% in 2002.

In January 2004, a decision was made to realign the operations
of Next Level Communications, Inc. (“Next
Level”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, within BCS.
The financial results of Next Level have been reclassified from
the Other Products segment to BCS for all periods presented.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 26% to
$2.3 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2003. The
increase in overall net sales was primarily due to:
(i) increased purchases of digital cable set-top boxes by
cable operators, (ii) an increase in ASP due to a mix shift
in digital set-top boxes towards higher-end products, and
(iii) an increase in retail sales. The increase in net
sales reflects net sales growth in all regions, primarily in
North America. Net sales in North America continue to comprise a
significant portion of the segment’s business, accounting
for 83% of the segment’s total net sales in 2004, compared
to 85% in 2003. The segment’s backlog was $314 million
at December 31, 2004, compared to $299 million at
December 31, 2003.

Demand for the segment’s products depends primarily on the
level of capital spending by broadband operators for
constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their communications
systems and services. In recent prior years, cable operators
have decreased their capital spending, primarily in an effort to
reduce their overall cost structures and improve their cash
flow. In 2004, our cable operator customers increased their
purchases of the segment’s products and services, primarily
due to increased demand for advanced set-tops to provide
high-definition/digital video recording (“HD/ DVR”)
functionality. In addition to the increased spending by cable
operators, retail sales have increased as consumer demand for
high-speed cable access continues to increase.

In 2004, net sales of digital set-top boxes increased 29%, due
to increases in both ASP and unit shipments. The increase in ASP
was driven by a product-mix shift towards higher-end products,
particularly HD/ DVR set-tops. The increase in unit shipments
was primarily due to the increased spending by cable operators.
The segment continued to be the worldwide leader in market share
for digital cable set-top boxes.

In 2004, net sales of cable modems increased 20%. The increase
in net sales was due to an increase in cable modem unit
shipments, which was partially offset by the decline in ASP for
cable modems. The decrease in ASP was primarily due to increased
competition. The segment retained its leading worldwide market
share in cable modems.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The segment is dependent upon a small number of customers for a
significant portion of its sales. Because of continuing
consolidation within the cable industry, a small number of large
cable television multiple system operators (“MSOs”)
own a large portion of the cable systems and account for a
significant portion of the total capital spending. In 2004, net
sales to the segment’s top five customers represented 47%
of the segment’s total net sales. Net sales to the
segment’s largest customer, Comcast, accounted for 30% of
the total net sales of the segment. The loss of business from
any major MSO could have a significant impact on the
segment’s business.

The segment generated operating earnings of $116 million in
2004, compared to an operating loss of $38 million in 2003.
The improvement in operating results was due to: (i) an
increase in gross margin, which was due to the 26% increase in
net sales, (ii) a $73 million charge for impairment of
goodwill related to the infrastructure business that occurred in
2003, and (iii) a decrease in SG&A expenditures. The
decrease in SG&A expenditures was primarily due to:
(i) a decrease in intangible amortization, and (ii) a
decrease in administrative expenses due to benefits from prior
cost-reduction actions, partially offset by an increase in
employee incentive program accruals. These improvements in
operating results were partially offset by a $15 million
charge for in-process research and development related to the
acquisition of Quantum Bridge in May 2004. Although gross margin
increased, the segment’s gross margin as a percentage of
net sales decreased, primarily due to sales of new higher-tier
products carrying lower initial margins, which is typical of the
early phases of the segment’s product life cycles.

In May 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Quantum
Bridge, a leading provider of FTTP solutions. The acquisition
complements Motorola’s existing multiservice technology,
enabling the Company to offer a full-service access platform
that broadband network operators can deploy to deliver the next
generation of advanced services. Motorola plans to integrate
Quantum Bridge’s field-proven passive optical networking
and carrier-class switching technology into its suite of network
infrastructure solutions, enhancing the Company’s market
position in the end-to-end delivery of broadband products.

Segment Results—2003 Compared to 2002

In 2003, the segment’s net sales declined 13% to
$1.9 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2002. The
segment’s backlog was $299 million at
December 31, 2003, compared to $324 million at
December 31, 2002. In 2003, the segment’s customers
significantly reduced their capital spending for the second
consecutive year, primarily in an effort to reduce cost
structures and improve their cash flow. This was reflected in
lower purchases of digital set-top terminals, as well as a
reduction in purchases of network transmission systems and
equipment. The decrease in the segment’s net sales was
driven by this reduction in spending by the segment’s
customers. The industry also experienced a reduction in ASP for
cable modems.

On a geographic basis, $1.5 billion, or 84%, of the
segment’s net sales were in North America in 2003, compared
to $1.8 billion, or 85%, in 2002. Of the $286 million
decline in net sales in 2003, the majority was in North America.
The decline in North America, and other regions, was driven by
the decline in sales of digital set-top box units.

In 2003, net sales of digital set-top boxes decreased 30%
compared to 2002. The decrease in net sales was due to a
decrease in unit shipments and ASP. The decline in unit
shipments and ASP are consistent with the overall decline in the
set-top box industry, and the segment retained its leading
market share in North America.

In 2003, net sales of cable modems increased 3% compared to
2002. The increase in net sales was driven by an increase in
unit shipments, which were partially offset by a decrease in
ASP. The decrease in ASP for cable modems was primarily due to
increased competition in low-end cable modems. The segment
retained its leading worldwide market share in cable modems.

In 2003, the segment was dependent upon a small number of
customers for a significant portion of its sales. A small number
of large cable television multiple system operators own a large
portion of the cable systems and account for a significant
portion of the total capital spending in the cable equipment
industry. Net sales to the segment’s largest customer,
Comcast, accounted for 40% of consolidated net sales of the
segment in 2003.

The segment reported an operating loss of $38 million in
2003, compared to an operating loss of $216 million in
2002. The improvement in operating results was primarily related
to a decrease in reorganization of businesses and other charges,
partially offset by a decrease in gross margin, reflecting the
13% decline in net sales.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the full year 2003, the segment recorded net charges of
$67 million related to reorganization of businesses and
other charges. These charges primarily consisted of: (i) a
$73 million charge for impairment of goodwill related to
the infrastructure business, partially offset by a reduction in
accruals no longer needed, primarily related to segment-wide
employee severance costs.

For the full year 2002, the segment recorded net charges of
$369 million related to reorganization of businesses and
other charges. These charges primarily consisted of: (i) a
$325 million intangible asset impairment charge relating to
a license to certain intellectual property that enables the
Company to provide national authorization services for digital
set-top terminals, (ii) a $37 million net charge for
segment-wide employee separation costs, and (iii) an
$11 million charge for in-process research and development
related to the acquisition of Synchronous, Inc., partially
offset by the recognition of a pension curtailment gain of
$13 million related to the General Instrument pension plan.

Other

Other is comprised of the Other Products segment and general
corporate items. The Other Products segment includes:
(i) various corporate programs representing developmental
businesses and research and development projects that are not
included in any major segment, and (ii) Motorola Credit
Corporation, the Company’s wholly-owned finance subsidiary.

In January 2004, a decision was made to realign the operations
of Next Level Communications, Inc. (“Next
Level”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, within BCS.
The financial results of Next Level have been reclassified from
the Other Products segment to BCS for all periods presented.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 20% to
$387 million, compared to $323 million in 2003. The
Other Products segment’s net sales are predominantly to
other Motorola businesses.

The segment had an operating loss of $393 million in 2004,
compared to an operating loss of $141 million in 2003. The
decline in operating results was primarily due to: (i) a
$125 million goodwill impairment charge related to a sensor
business that occurred in 2004, (ii) income of
$69 million from the reversal of accruals no longer needed
due to a settlement with the Company’s insurer on items
related to previous environmental claims that occurred in 2003,
(iii) income of $59 million due to a reversal of
accruals no longer needed related to the Iridium project that
occurred in 2003, (iv) income of $33 million on the
gain from the sale of Iridium-related assets that were
previously written down that occurred in 2003, (v) an
$11 million increase in reorganization of business charges
in 2004, primarily due to an increase in employee severance
charges. These items were partially offset by $44 million
in income in 2004 from the reversal of financing receivable
reserves due to the partial collection of a
previously-uncollected receivable.

Segment Results—2003 Compared to 2002

In 2003, the segment’s net sales decreased 25% to
$323 million, compared to $430 million in 2002. The
Other Products segment’s net sales are predominantly to
other Motorola businesses.

The segment incurred an operating loss of $141 million in
2003, compared to an operating loss of $487 million in
2002. The improvement in operating results was primarily related
to: (i) a decrease in reorganization of business and other
charges, and (ii) a decrease in SG&A and R&D
expenditures resulting from the benefits from cost-reduction
activities.

For the full year 2003, the segment recorded net income of
$151 million related to reorganization of businesses and
other charges. This net income primarily consisted of:
(i) income of $69 million from the reversal of
accruals no longer needed due to a settlement with the
Company’s insurer on items related to previous
environmental claims that occurred in 2003, (ii) income of
$59 million due to a reversal of accruals no longer

needed related to the Iridium project that occurred in 2003, and
(iii) income of $33 million on the gain on the sale of
Iridium-related assets that were previously written down that
occurred in 2003.

For the full year 2002, the segment recorded net charges of
$34 million related to reorganization of businesses and
other charges. These net charges primarily consisted of:
(i) $56 million in net charges for fixed asset
impairments, (ii) $46 million in net charges for
segment-wide employee separation costs, and
(iii) $16 million in net charges for exit costs,
partially offset by: (i) income of $63 million for
Iridium vendor termination settlements and the related reduction
of accruals no longer needed, and (ii) income of $24
million for the reduction of accruals no longer needed due to
the settlement with the Company’s insurer on items related
to previous environmental claims.

2005 Change in Organizational Structure

In December 2004, the Company announced a reorganization of its
businesses and functions to align with the Company’s
seamless mobility strategy, which was effective on
January 1, 2005. The Company will be organized into four
main business groups, focused on mobile devices, networks,
government and enterprise, and the connected home. The Mobile
Devices business will be primarily comprised of the current
Personal Communications segment and the Energy Systems group
from the Integrated Electronic Systems segment
(“IESS”). The Networks business will be primarily
comprised of the current Global Telecom Solutions segment, the
Embedded Computing and Communications group from IESS, and the
next-generation wireline networks business from the Broadband
Communications segment (“BCS”). The Government and
Enterprise business will be primarily comprised of the current
Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions segment and the
Automotive Communications and Electronics Systems group from
IESS. The Connected Home business will be primarily comprised of
the current BCS, excluding the next-generation wireline networks
business. In addition, the Company’s key support functions,
including supply-chain operations, information technology,
finance, human resources, legal, strategy and business
development, marketing, quality and technology will be
architected centrally and distributed throughout the Company.
The Company will be aligned into these four main operating
segments with the analysis of reportable segments to be
completed in the first quarter of 2005.

Significant Accounting Policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.

Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current economic and industry conditions and on
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following significant accounting
policies require significant judgment and estimates:

— Valuation of investments and long-lived assets

— Restructuring activities

— Allowance for losses on finance receivables

— Retirement-related benefits

— Long-term contract accounting

— Deferred tax asset valuation

— Inventory valuation reserves



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Valuation of Investments and Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of investments and
long-lived assets, which includes identifiable intangible
assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important which
could trigger an impairment review include:
(i) underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results; (ii) changes in the
manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall
business; (iii) negative industry or economic trends;
(iv) declines in stock price of an investment for a
sustained period; and (v) our market capitalization
relative to net book value.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
intangible assets, goodwill and long-lived assets may not be
recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded. Impairment is
generally measured based on a projected discounted cash flow
method using a discount rate determined by our management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
model or prevailing market rates of investment securities, if
available.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the net book values of these
assets were as follows (in millions):

December 31



Property, plant and equipment

$

2,332

$

2,473

Investments

3,241

3,302

Intangible assets



Goodwill

1,283

1,215

$

7,068

$

7,163

The Company did not record any fixed asset impairment charges in
2004, compared to charges of $10 million in 2003. The 2003
charges primarily related to certain information technology
equipment that was deemed to be impaired.

The Company recorded impairment charges related to its
investment portfolio of $36 million and $96 million in
2004 and 2003, respectively, representing other-than-temporary
declines in the value of the Company’s investment
portfolio. The $96 million impairment charge in 2003 was
primarily comprised of a $29 million charge to write down
to zero the Company’s debt security holding in a European
cable operator and other cost-based investment writedowns.
Additionally, the available-for-sale securities portfolio
reflected a net pre-tax unrealized gain position of
$2.3 billion at December 31, 2004, compared to a net
pre-tax unrealized gain position of $2.4 billion at
December 31, 2003.

The Company performs a goodwill impairment test at the reporting
unit level as of October 1 each year, or more often should
triggering events occur. In determining the fair value of the
reporting unit, the Company utilizes independent appraisal firms
who employ a combination of present value techniques and quoted
market prices of comparable businesses. During 2004, the Company
determined that goodwill related to a sensor business within the
Other Products segment was impaired, resulting in a write-off of
goodwill totaling $125 million. During 2003, the Company
determined that the goodwill at the infrastructure reporting
unit of the Broadband Communications segment was impaired by
$73 million.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of future
impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might
have on these reported asset values. Such events may include
strategic decisions made in response to the economic conditions
relative to product lines or operations and the impact of the
economic environment on our customer base.

Restructuring Activities

The Company records provisions for employee separation and exit
costs when they are probable and estimable. The Company
maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (“Severance
Plan”) which permits Motorola to offer to eligible
employees severance benefits based on years of service in the
event that employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of
a reduction-in-force or restructuring. Each separate
reduction-in-force has qualified for severance benefits under
the Severance Plan and, therefore, such benefits are accounted
for in accordance with SFAS 112, “Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits”. Under the provisions of
SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefit
formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future
settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on
estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved
by management.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Exit costs primarily consist of future minimum lease payments on
vacated facilities. At each reporting date, the Company
evaluates its accruals for exit costs and employee separation
costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain
circumstances, accruals are no longer required because of
efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees
previously identified for separation resigned from the Company
and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to
circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were
initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the
Reorganization of Businesses income statement line item when it
is determined they are no longer required.

Allowance for Losses on Finance Receivables

The Company has historically provided financing to certain
customers in connection with purchases of the Company’s
infrastructure equipment. Financing provided has included all or
a portion of the equipment purchase price, as well as working
capital for certain purchasers.

Gross financing receivables were $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2004 and $2.4 billion at
December 31, 2003, with an allowance for losses on these
receivables of $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion,
respectively. Of the receivables at December 31, 2004,
$2.0 billion ($7 million, net of allowance for losses
of $2.0 billion) were considered impaired based on
management’s determination that the Company will be unable
to collect all amounts in accordance with the contractual terms
of the relevant agreement. By comparison, impaired receivables
at December 31, 2003 were $2.2 billion
($133 million, net of allowance for losses of
$2.1 billion).

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had
$1.9 billion and $2.0 billion of gross receivables
from one customer, Telsim. The decline represents partial
recovery of amounts owed of $44 million due to collection
efforts during 2004. As a result of difficulties in collecting
the amounts due from Telsim, the Company has previously recorded
charges reducing the net receivable from Telsim to zero.

Management periodically reviews customer account activity in
order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for
potential losses. Factors considered include economic
conditions, collateral values and each customer’s payment
history and credit worthiness. Adjustments, if any, are made to
reserve balances following the completion of these reviews to
reflect management’s best estimate of potential losses. The
resulting net finance receivable balance is intended to
represent the estimated realizable value as determined based on:
(i) the fair value of the underlying collateral, if the
receivable is collateralized, or (ii) the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest
rate implicit in the underlying receivable.

Retirement-Related Benefits

The Company accounts for its pension benefits and its
postretirement health care benefits using actuarial models
required by SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions,” respectively. These models use an
attribution approach that generally spreads individual events
over the service lives of the employees in the plan. Examples of
“events” are plan amendments and changes in actuarial
assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases. The
principle underlying the required attribution approach is that
employees render service over their service lives on a
relatively consistent basis and, therefore, the income statement
effects of pension benefits or postretirement health care
benefits are earned in, and should be expensed in, the same
pattern.

There are various assumptions used in calculating the net
periodic benefit expense and related benefit obligations. One of
these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets. The required use of expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income
that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan
assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected
long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual
long-term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income
and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of
the services provided by the employees. Differences between
actual and expected returns are recognized in the net periodic
pension calculation over five years.

The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience
with consideration of the expected investment mix of the
plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term
investment returns to develop its expected rate of return
assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost and
the net retirement healthcare expense. The Company’s
investment return assumption for the Regular Pension Plan and
Postretirement Health Care Benefits



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Plan was 8.50% in both 2004 and 2003. The investment return
assumption for the Officers’ Pension Plan was 6.00% in both
2004 and 2003.

A second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate
assumptions used for pension benefits and postretirement health
care benefits accounting reflects, at December 31 of each
year, the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income
debt instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the
measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows
to pay the benefit obligation when due. The Company’s
discount rate for measuring the obligations was 6.00% at
December 31, 2004, compared to 6.50% at December 31,
2003.

A final set of assumptions involves the cost drivers of the
underlying benefits. The rate of compensation increase is a key
assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting
and is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans
for such increases. In both 2004 and 2003, the Company’s
rate for future compensation increase was 4.00% for non-officer
employees and 3.00% for officers. For retiree medical plan
accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own
historical trends for health care costs to determine the health
care cost trend rates. Based on this review, the health care
cost trend rate used to determine the December 31, 2004
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 10% for 2005
with a declining trend rate of 1% each year until it reaches 5%
by 2010, with a flat 5% rate for 2010 and beyond.

At December 31, 2004, the Regular Pension Plan investment
portfolio was predominantly equity investments and the
Officers’ Pension Plan investment portfolio was
predominantly fixed-income securities.

Negative financial market returns during 2000-2002 resulted in a
decline in the fair-market value of plan assets. This, when
combined with declining discount rate assumptions in the last
several years, has resulted in a decline in the funded status of
the Company’s domestic and certain non-U.S. plans.
Consequently, the Company’s accumulated benefit obligation
for various plans exceeded the fair-market value of the plan
assets for these plans at December 31, 2004. The Company
recorded a non-cash, after-tax, net charge of $188 million
to equity relating to the Regular Pension Plan, the
Officers’ Pension Plan, and certain
non-U.S. subsidiaries retirement programs in the fourth
quarter of 2004. This charge was included in Non-Owner Changes
to Equity in the consolidated balance sheets, and did not impact
the Company’s pension expense, earnings or cash
contribution requirements in 2004.

For the Regular Pension Plan, the Company currently estimates
2005 expenses for continuing operations will be approximately
$173 million. The 2004 and 2003 actual expenses, which
include discontinued operations, were $167 million and
$137 million, respectively. Cash contributions of
$580 million were made to the Regular Pension Plan in 2004.
The Company expects to make cash contributions of
$150 million to this plan during 2005. In addition, the
Company expects to make cash contributions of $45 million
to its Non U.S. pension plans in 2005.

For the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan, the Company
currently estimates 2005 expenses for continuing operations will
be approximately $35 million. The 2004 and 2003 actual
expenses, which include discontinued operations, were
$39 million and $43 million, respectively. The Company
has partially funded its accumulated benefit obligation of
$544 million with Plan assets valued at $188 million
at December 31, 2004. Excluded from these accumulated
benefit obligations was $217 million, representing
post-retirement health care benefit obligations transferred to
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale
Semiconductor”) following the spin-off on December 2,
2004. In addition, Motorola is obligated to transfer to
Freescale Semiconductor $68 million in cash or plan assets,
as permitted by law without adverse tax consequences to
Motorola, with such transfer expected to occur in 2005. No cash
contributions were required in 2004, 2003 or 2002. The Company
expects to make a cash contribution of approximately
$50 million to the retiree health care plan in 2005.

The impact on the future financial results of the Company in
relation to retirement-related benefits is dependent on economic
conditions, employee demographics, interest rates and investment
performance. The Company’s measurement date of its plan
assets and obligations is December 31. Thus, during the
fourth quarter of each year, management reviews and, if
necessary, adjusts the assumptions associated with its benefit
plans.

Long-Term Contract Accounting

The Company applied the percentage-of-completion methodology as
stated in Statement of Position 81-1, “Accounting for
Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts,” to recognize revenues on various long-term
contracts involving proven technologies representing
approximately 9% of the Company’s net sales in 2004. These
contracts primarily involve the design, engineering,
manufacturing, and installation of wireless infrastructure
communication systems by GTSS and two-way radio voice and data
systems by CGISS. These systems are designed to meet specific
customer specifications and typically require an extended period
of time to construct.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company executes contracts with customers that describe the
equipment and system specifications to be delivered, including
the consideration to be received. Revenue is recognized as work
progresses on each contract and is based on the percentage of
costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract
costs. Estimates of total contract costs and progress toward
completion of each contract are prepared using estimates and
judgments based on historical experience and on other factors
believed to be relevant under the circumstances. Management
regularly assesses normal, recurring business risks and
uncertainties inherent in these customer contracts and considers
the impact, if any, of these uncertainties in the preparation of
contract estimates. These uncertainties may include system
performance and implementation delays resulting from events both
within and outside the control of the Company. Losses on
individual contracts, if any, are recognized during the period
in which the loss first becomes evident.

Changes in these estimates could negatively impact the
Company’s operating results. In addition, unforeseen
conditions could arise over the contract term that may have a
significant impact on the operating results. It is reasonably
likely that different operating results would be reported if the
Company used other acceptable revenue recognition methodologies,
such as the completed-contract method, or applied different
assumptions.

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based
on the differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company
regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and
establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable
income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of
the reversals of existing temporary differences and the
implementation of tax-planning strategies. If the Company is
unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain
tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the
actual effective tax rates or time period within which the
underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible,
the Company could be required to increase its valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in an
increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on
operating results.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s deferred
tax assets related to U.S. tax carryforwards were
$1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The tax
carryforwards are comprised of net operating loss carryforwards,
foreign tax credit and other tax credit carryovers. A majority
of the net operating losses and other tax credits can be carried
forward for 20 years. The carryforward period for foreign
tax credits was extended to ten years, from five years, during
2004 due to the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances for certain state
deferred tax assets, state tax loss carryforwards with
carryforward periods of seven years or less, tax loss
carryforwards of acquired entities that are subject to
limitations and tax loss carryforwards of certain
non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company believes that the
deferred tax assets for the remaining tax carryforwards are
considered more likely than not to be realizable based on
estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax
planning strategies.

Inventory Valuation Reserves

The Company records valuation reserves on its inventory for
estimated obsolescence or unmarketability. The amount of the
reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the
inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis,
management in each segment performs an analysis of the
underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and
obsolescence and for the remaining inventory assesses the net
realizable value. Management uses its best judgment to estimate
appropriate reserves based on this analysis.

Net Inventories consisted of the following:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory
levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its
customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to
rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As
indicated above, the Company’s inventory reserves
represented 18% and 22% of the gross inventory balance at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These reserve
levels are maintained by the Company to provide for unique
circumstances facing our businesses. The Company has inventory
reserves for pending cancellations of product lines due to
technology changes, long-life cycle products, lifetime buys at
the end of supplier production runs, business exits, and a shift
of production to outsourcing.

The decline in the reserve balance in 2004 compared to 2003
primarily relates to scrapping of excess and obsolete inventory
with the appropriate reduction in the related gross inventory
balance. If actual future demand or market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional
inventory writedowns may be required. Likewise, as with other
reserves based on management’s judgment, if the reserve is
no longer needed, amounts are reversed into income. There were
no significant reversals into income of this type in 2004.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement No. 123R, a revision to
Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” This standard requires the Company to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards.
The cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the
vesting period of the awards. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS 123R at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005.
The standard provides for a prospective application. Under this
method, the Company will begin recognizing compensation cost for
equity based compensation for all new or modified grants after
the date of adoption. In addition, the Company will recognize
the unvested portion of the grant date fair value of awards
issued prior to adoption based on the fair values previously
calculated for disclosure purposes. At December 31, 2004,
the aggregate value of unvested options, as determined using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model, was $540 million.
Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, a majority of this amount will
be recognized over the remaining vesting period of these options.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” (“SFAS 151”).
SFAS 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage, be charged to
expense in the period they are incurred rather than capitalized
as a component of inventory costs. Statement 151 is
effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this
standard may result in higher expenses in periods where
production levels are lower than normal ranges of production.
Because actual future production levels are subject to many
factors, including demand for the Company’s products, the
Company cannot determine if the adoption of SFAS 151 will
have a material impact on future results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,”
(“SFAS 153”). SFAS 153 amends Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 29,
“Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,”
(Opinion 29) to require exchanges of nonmonetary assets be
accounted for at fair value, rather than carryover basis.
Nonmonetary exchanges that lack commercial substance are exempt
from this requirement. SFAS 153 is effective for
nonmonetary exchanges entered into in fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company does not routinely enter
into exchanges that could be considered nonmonetary, accordingly
the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 153 to
have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

We wish to caution the reader that the following important
business risks and factors, and those business risks and factors
described elsewhere in this report or our other Securities and
Exchange Commission filings, could cause our actual results to
differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking
statements.

The demand for our products depends in large part on the
continued growth of the industries in which we participate. A
market decline in any one of these industries could have an
adverse effect on our business.

Our business was very negatively impacted by the economic
slowdown and the corresponding reduction in capital spending by
the telecommunications industry from 2001 to 2003. We incurred
sizeable net losses in 2001 and 2002. The rate at which the
portions of the telecommunications industry in which we
participate improve is critical to our ability to improve our
overall financial performance.

Our customers and our manufacturing facilities are located
throughout the world, and as a result, we face risks that other
companies that are not global may not face.

Our customers are located throughout the world and more than
half of our net sales are made to customers outside of the U.S.
In addition, we have many manufacturing, administrative and
sales facilities outside the U.S., more than half of our
products are manufactured outside the U.S. and approximately 55%
of our employees are employed outside the U.S.

As with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations
outside the U.S., we are exposed to risks that could negatively
impact sales and/or profitability, including but not limited to:
(1) tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes;
(2) regulations related to customs and import/export
matters; (3) longer payment cycles; (4) tax issues,
such as tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to
country and as compared to the U.S., and difficulties with
repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient
manner; (5) currency fluctuations, particularly in the euro
and Chinese renminbi; (6) challenges in collecting accounts
receivable; (7) cultural and language differences;
(8) employment regulations and local labor conditions;
(9) difficulties protecting IP in foreign countries;
(10) instability in economic or political conditions,
including inflation, recession, actual or anticipated military
or political conflicts; (11) natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons, and (12) public health
issues or outbreaks.

Many of our products that are manufactured outside of the
U.S. are manufactured in Asia. In particular, we have
sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing
operations, and 9% of our net sales are made to customers in
China. The legal system in China is still developing and is
subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for
products in China could be adversely impacted by changes to or
interpretation of Chinese law. Further, if manufacturing in the
region is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly
reduced and sales and/or profitability could be negatively
impacted.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

If the quality of our products does not meet our
customers’ expectations, then our sales and operating
earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be adversely
affected.

Occasionally, some of the products we sell have quality issues
resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from
the software used in the product. Often these issues are
identified prior to the shipment of the products and may cause
delays in shipping products to customers, or even the
cancellation of orders by customers. Sometimes, we discover
quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to
our distributors or end-user customers, requiring us to resolve
such issues in a timely manner that is least disruptive to our
customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment quality issues
can have legal and financial ramifications, including: delays in
the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue and/or future
orders, customer-imposed penalties on Motorola for failure to
meet contractual shipment deadlines, increased costs associated
with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on
our goodwill and brand name reputation.

In some cases, if the quality issue affects the product’s
safety or regulatory compliance, then such a
“defective” product may need to be recalled. Depending
on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the
field, a recall can incur substantial recall costs, in addition
to the costs associated with the potential loss of future
orders, and the damage to the Company’s goodwill or
brand/reputation. In addition, the Company may be required,
under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for failed
performance that might exceed the revenue that the Company
receives from the contracts. Recalls involving regulatory
agencies can also result in fines and additional costs. Finally,
recalls can result in third-party litigation, including class
action litigation by persons alleging common harm resulting from
the purchase of the products.

We operate in highly competitive markets and our financial
results will be affected if we are not able to compete
effectively.

The markets for our products are highly competitive with respect
to, among other factors: pricing, product and service quality,
and the time to introduce new products and services. We are
constantly exposed to the risk that our competitors may
implement new technologies before we do, or may offer lower
prices, additional products or services or other incentives that
we cannot or will not offer. We can give no assurances that we
will be able to compete successfully against existing or future
competitors.

The uncertainty of current economic and political conditions
makes budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce demand
for our products.

Current conditions in the domestic and global economies are
extremely uncertain. The U.S. involvement in Iraq and other
global conflicts, including in the Middle East, and public
health issues have created many economic and political
uncertainties that have severely impacted the global economy. As
a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for
the world economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to
estimate growth in various parts of the world economy, including
the markets in which we participate. Because all components of
our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of
growth in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the
prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future
income and expenditures even more difficult than usual to make.

The future direction of the overall domestic and global
economies will have a significant impact on our overall
performance. The potential for future terrorist attacks,
increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing
conflicts and public health issues has created worldwide
uncertainties that have negatively impacted, and may continue to
negatively impact, demand for certain of our products.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to
purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components
to meet the demands of our customers.

Our ability to meet customer demands depends, in part, on our
ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials,
parts and components from our suppliers and our internal
manufacturing capacity. We have experienced shortages in the
past that have adversely affected our operations. Although we
work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of
shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter
these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain of our
components are available only from a single source or limited
sources. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely
manner. A reduction or interruption in supplies, or a
significant increase in the price of supplies could have a
material adverse effect on our businesses.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In December 2004, we completed the spin-off of Freescale
Semiconductor, Inc., a company comprised of our former
semiconductor business. Our businesses have and continue to
purchase a large portion of the semiconductors used in their
products from Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. The change in this
relationship from internal supplier to external supplier may
negatively impact this important supplier relationship and could
have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions.
Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such
actions on our business may be limited by a variety of factors.
The cost reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional
production risk and have an adverse effect on our sales and
profitability.

Since the second half of 2000, we have been reducing costs and
simplifying our product portfolios in all of our businesses. We
have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated
manufacturing operations and reduced our employee population.

The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and
profitability may be influenced by factors including but not
limited to: (1) our ability to successfully complete these
ongoing efforts; (2) our ability to generate the level of
cost savings we expect and/or that are necessary to enable us to
effectively compete; (3) delays in implementation of
anticipated workforce reductions in highly-regulated locations
outside of the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia;
(4) decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet
operational targets due to the loss of employees, particularly
sales employees; (5) our ability to retain or recruit key
employees; (6) the appropriateness of the size of our
manufacturing capacity, including capacity from third parties;
and (7) the performance of other parties under outsourcing
arrangements on which we rely for the manufacture of certain
products, parts and components.

An important cost-reduction action has been to reduce the number
of our facilities, including manufacturing facilities. All of
our businesses have exited certain facilities and/or
consolidated facilities so that our products are manufactured in
fewer facilities. While we have business continuity and risk
management plans in place in case capacity is significantly
reduced or eliminated at a given facility, the reduced number of
alternative facilities could cause the period of any
manufacturing disruptions to be longer. As a result, we could
have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and
profits could decline.

Another cost-reduction action has been to develop outsourcing
arrangements for the design and/or manufacture of certain
products, parts and components. If these third parties fail to
deliver quality products, parts and components on time and at
reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our
orders and our sales and profits could decline.

We may not continue to have access to the capital markets to
obtain long-term and short-term financing on acceptable terms
and conditions, particularly if our credit ratings are
downgraded.

From time to time we access the long-term and short-term capital
markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that we can
continue to access the capital markets in 2005 on acceptable
terms and conditions, the Company’s current levels of
outstanding debt and our credit ratings could limit our
flexibility with regard to long-term financing activity. In
addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access
the capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall
capital markets and the current state of the economy, including
the telecommunications industry, are outside of our control.
There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access
to the capital markets on terms acceptable to the Company.

While we still maintain an investment grade credit rating, if
our rating by Moody’s Investor Service
(“Moody’s”) were to decline one level from the
current rating, we would no longer be considered investment
grade by Moody’s. As a result, our financial flexibility
would be reduced and our cost of borrowing would increase. Some
of the factors that impact our credit ratings, including the
overall economic health of the telecommunications industry, are
outside of our control. There can be no assurances that our
current credit ratings will continue.

Our commercial paper is rated “A-2/ P-3/ F-2.” Given
the much smaller size of the market for commercial paper rated
“A-2/ P-3/ F2” and the number of large commercial
paper issuers in this market, commercial paper or other
short-term borrowings may be unavailable or of limited
availability to participants in this market. Although we
continue to issue commercial paper, we have greatly reduced it
as a funding source. There can be no assurances that we will
continue to have access to the commercial paper markets on terms
acceptable to the Company.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility
if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing in our
facility.

We view our existing three-year revolving domestic credit
facility as a source of available liquidity. This facility
contains various conditions, covenants and representations with
which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We have
never borrowed under this facility. However, if we wish to
borrow under this facility in the future, there can be no
assurance that we will be in compliance with these conditions,
covenants and representations.

We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use
under certain circumstances.

If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable
income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant
change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period
within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable
or deductible, the Company could be required to increase its
valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting
in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact
on future operating results.

Our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new
products and technologies and our results can be impacted by our
significant investments in new products and technologies.

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly
changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, short
product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Our success
depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful
introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to
comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing
technological and product developments carried out by our
competitors. The research and development of new,
technologically-advanced products is a complex and uncertain
process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the
accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may
focus our resources on technologies that do not become widely
accepted and are not commercially viable. In addition, products
may contain defects or errors that are detected only after
deployment. If our products are not competitive or do not work
properly, our business will suffer.

Our results are subject to risks related to our significant
investment in developing and introducing new products, such as:
advanced digital wireless handsets; CDMA2000 1X, UMTS and other
technologies for 3G wireless networks; products for transmission
of telephony and high-speed data over hybrid fiber coaxial cable
systems; integrated digital radios; and integrated public safety
systems. These risks include: (i) difficulties and delays
in the development, production, testing and marketing of
products; (ii) customer acceptance of products;
(iii) the development of industry standards; (iv) the
significant amount of resources we must devote to the
development of new technology; and (v) the ability to
differentiate our products and compete with other companies in
the same markets.

Our success, in part, will be affected by the ability of our
wireless businesses to successfully compete in the ever-evolving
markets in which we participate. We face intense competition in
these markets from both established companies and new entrants.
Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive
to develop and bring to market.

We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other
companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce
significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to
integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from
the acquisitions.

In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth
opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the difficulty
in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an
efficient and effective manner; (2) the challenges in
achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits
from acquisitions; (3) the risk that our markets do not
evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not
prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;
(4) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired
businesses; (5) the risk of diverting the attention of
senior management from our operations; (6) the risks of
entering new markets in which we have limited experience;
(7) difficulties in expanding information technology
systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired
businesses; and (8) future impairments of goodwill of an
acquired business.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Many acquisition candidates in the industries in which we
participate carry higher relative valuations than we do. This is
particularly evident in software and services businesses.
Acquiring a business that has a higher valuation than Motorola
is dilutive to our earnings, especially when the acquired
business has little or no revenue. In addition, we may not
pursue opportunities that are highly dilutive to earnings and
have, in the past, foregone such acquisitions.

Key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial
value in connection with a transaction in the form of
change-in-control agreements, acceleration of stock options and
the lifting of restrictions on other equity-based compensation
rights. To retain such employees and integrate the acquired
business, we may offer additional, sometimes costly, retention
incentives.

Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form
successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not
develop as expected, our business may be adversely impacted.

We currently partner with industry leaders to meet customer
product and service requirements and to develop innovative
advances in design and technology. Our partnerships allow us to
supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share the cost of
developing next-generation technologies. If such arrangements do
not develop as expected, for example, because the technologies
provided by our partners are not protected or infringe on third
parties’ intellectual property rights, or the technology or
other contributions by our partners do not meet quality or
safety standards, our business could be adversely impacted.

As a supplier to the automotive industry, we face certain
risks due to the nature of the automotive business.

As a supplier of powertrain chassis and telematics communication
products, our sales of these products and our profitability
could be negatively impacted by changes in the operations,
products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial
condition, market share or consumer financing and rebate
programs of our automotive customers. In addition, demand for
our automotive products is linked to consumer demand for
automobiles, which may be adversely impacted by the continuing
uncertain economic environment.

The value of our investments in the securities of various
companies fluctuates and it may be difficult for us to realize
the value of these investments.

We hold a portfolio of investments in various companies. Since
the majority of these securities represent investments in
technology companies, the fair market values of these securities
are subject to significant price volatility. In addition, the
realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
other conditions.

We also have invested in numerous privately-held companies, many
of which can still be considered in startup or developmental
stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for
the technologies or products they have under development are
typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
could lose all or substantially all of our investments in these
companies, and in some cases have.

It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of
highly-skilled employees that are necessary to remain
competitive.

Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology
industries is intense. We believe that our future success
depends in large part on our continued ability to hire,
assimilate and retain qualified engineers and other
highly-skilled personnel needed to compete and develop
successful new products. We may not be as successful as our
competitors at recruiting, assimilating and retaining these
highly-skilled personnel, especially because of our recent
employee reductions.

The unfavorable outcome of litigation pending against or
future litigation could materially impact the Company.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation,
including without limitation any relating to the Iridium project
or Telsim. See “Item 3— Legal Proceedings.”
There can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any
litigation.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our business will be harmed if we are found to have infringed
intellectual property rights of third parties, or if our
intellectual property protection is inadequate to protect our
proprietary rights.

Because our products are comprised of complex technology, we are
involved in litigation regarding patent and other intellectual
property rights. Third parties have asserted, and in the future
may assert, claims against us alleging that we have infringed
their intellectual property rights. If we do not succeed in any
such litigation, we could be required to expend significant
resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual
property or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that
is the subject of such litigation. However, we cannot be certain
that any such licenses, if available at all, will be available
to us on commercially reasonable terms. Also, defending these
claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our
management and other employees.

Our patent and other intellectual property rights are important
competitive tools and may generate income under license
agreements. We regard our intellectual property rights as
proprietary and attempt to protect them with patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality
agreements and other methods. We also generally restrict access
to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite
these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to
obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar
technology independently. In addition, effective patent,
copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be
unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third
parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our
intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our
business.

We are subject to a wide range of environmental, health and
safety laws.

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental,
health and safety laws, including laws relating to the use,
disposal, clean up of, and human exposure to hazardous
substances. In the United States, these laws often require
parties to fund remedial action regardless of fault. Factors
such as the discovery of additional contaminants, the extent of
remediation and compliance expenses, and the imposition of
additional cleanup obligations at Superfund and other sites
could cause our capital expenditures and other expenses relating
to remediation activities to exceed the amount reflected in our
environmental reserve and adversely affect our results of
operations and cash flows. Compliance with existing or future
environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future
liabilities, cause the suspension of production, restrict our
ability to expand facilities or require us to acquire costly
pollution control equipment or incur other significant expenses,
including the expense of modifying manufacturing processes. In
addition, restrictions on the use of certain materials in our
facilities or products in the future could have a negative
impact on our operations.

We may provide financing and financial guarantees to our
customers, some of which may be for significant amounts.

The competitive environment in which we operate may require us
to provide long-term customer financing to our customers in
order to win a contract. Customer financing arrangements may
include all or a portion of the purchase price for our products
and services, as well as working capital. In some circumstances,
these loans can be very large. We may also assist customers in
obtaining financing from banks and other sources and may also
provide financial guarantees on behalf of our customers. Our
success, particularly in our infrastructure businesses, may be
dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer
financing on competitive terms and on our customers’
creditworthiness.

We also provide revolving, short-term financing to certain
customers and distributors that purchase our equipment. Our
success may be dependent, in part, on our ability to provide
this financing. Our financial results could be negatively
impacted if our customers or distributors fail to repay this
revolving, short-term debt and/or our sales to such customers or
distributors could be reduced in the event of real or perceived
issues about the credit quality of the customer or distributor.

When we lend our customers money in connection with the sale
of our equipment, we are at risk of not being repaid.

While we have generally been able to place a portion of our
customer financings with third-party lenders, a portion of these
financings are supported directly by us. There can be higher
risks of default associated with some of these financings,
particularly when provided to start-up operations such as local
network providers, customers in developing countries, or
customers in specific financing-intensive areas of the industry
(such as 3G wireless operators). At the end of 2004, we had
reserves of $2.0 billion relating to our finance
receivables, primarily due to



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

customer defaults. Should additional customers fail to meet
their obligations on new or existing loans, losses could be
incurred and such losses could negatively impact our financial
results.

Our large system contracts for infrastructure equipment and
the resulting reliance on large customers may negatively impact
our business.

We are exposed to risks due to large system contracts for
infrastructure equipment and the resulting reliance on large
customers. These include: (1) the technological risks of
such contracts, especially when the contracts involve new
technology, and (2) the financial risks to us under these
contracts, including the estimates inherent in projecting costs
associated with large contracts and the related impact on
operating results. We are also facing increasing competition
from traditional system integrators and the defense industry as
system contracts become larger and more complicated. Political
developments can impact the nature and timing of these large
contracts.

It is important that we are able to obtain many different
types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance
we are forced to retain the risk.

The Company has many types of insurance coverage. Since the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the cost of
insurance has increased, deductibles have increased, and in some
cases, certain types or levels of insurance have not been
available. Motorola also self-insures for some risks and
obligations, including interruptions in our business resulting
from terrorist acts, and some natural disasters. As insurance
becomes more expensive or unavailable, we may have to
self-insure for more matters. If there are large losses related
to self-insured matters, our financial performance would be
negatively impacted.

Government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the
growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce
barriers to entry for new competitors.

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and
personal communications industry may be affected if adequate
frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new
technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies
currently allocated for such use. Industry growth has been and
may continue to be affected by the cost of new licenses required
to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new
wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered
for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network systems
such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems such as WiMax. Other
countries also deregulated portions of the available spectrum to
allow these and other technologies, which can be offered without
spectrum license costs and may introduce new competition and new
opportunities for Motorola and our customers.

Changes in government policies and laws or economic
conditions may adversely affect our financial results.

Our results may be affected by changes in trade, monetary and
fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of
U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar
organizations. Our results may also be affected by social and
economic conditions, which impact our operations, including in
emerging markets in Asia and Latin America and in markets
subject to ongoing political hostilities and war, including the
Middle East.

In addition, there are currently few laws or regulations that
apply directly to access to, or commerce on, the Internet. We
could be adversely affected by any such regulation in any
country where we operate. The adoption of such measures could
decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase
the cost of selling such products.

The growth of our Broadband Communications segment is
dependent, in part, on renewed growth in the cable industry.

The cable industry is a major customer of our Broadband
Communications segment. Primarily due to the economic recession
that began in 2001 and in an effort to improve their cash flow
and lower their cost structure, cable operators significantly
reduced their capital spending beginning in 2001 and continuing
through 2004. The



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ability of that segment to grow is dependent, in part, on growth
in enhanced service offerings in the cable industry, as well as
that industry’s ability to compete with other entertainment
providers.

Consolidations in the telecommunications and cable industries
may adversely impact our business.

The telecommunications and cable industries have experienced
significant consolidation and this trend is expected to
continue. We and one or more of our competitors may each supply
products to the companies that have merged or will merge. This
consolidation could result in delays in purchasing decisions by
the merged companies and/or Motorola playing a lesser role in
the supply of communications products to the merged companies.

Because of continuing consolidation within the cable industry
worldwide, a small number of operators own a majority of cable
television systems and account for a significant portion of the
capital spending made by cable television system operators. Last
year, net sales to the Broadband Communications segment’s
largest customer, Comcast, which merged with AT&T Broadband
in 2002, represented approximately 30% of the Broadband
Communications segment’s total net sales. Fewer significant
customers will increase our reliance on large customers and may
negatively impact our bargaining position and profit margins.
The loss of, or a lesser role with, a significant customer due
to industry consolidation may negatively impact our business.

Regulatory changes impacting our cable products may adversely
impact our business.

Currently, reception of digital television programming from the
cable broadband network requires a set-top terminal with certain
technology. This security technology has limited the
availability of set-top terminals to those manufactured by a few
cable network manufacturers, including Motorola. The FCC enacted
regulations requiring separation of security functionality from
set-top terminals to increase competition and encourage the sale
of set-top terminals in the retail market. Traditionally, cable
service providers sold or leased the set-top terminal to their
customer. As the retail market develops for set-top terminals,
sales of our set-top terminals may be negatively impacted.

The FCC has mandated that digital tuners to enable access to
cable networks be incorporated into television sets by 2006. As
a result, future sales of set-top terminals may be negatively
impacted.

We rely on complex information technology systems and
networks to operate our business. Any significant system or
network disruption could have a material adverse impact on our
operations, sales and operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex
information technology systems and networks. All information
technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or
interruption from a variety of sources, including but not
limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts,
natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new
or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not
installed properly. We have implemented various measures to
manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but
a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our
operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur
additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these
disruptions or security breaches.

Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.

Our share price has been volatile due, in part, to generally
volatile securities markets, and the volatility in the
telecommunications and technology companies’ securities
markets in particular. Factors other than our financial results
that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to,
market expectations of our performance, capital spending plans
of our customers, and the level perceived growth of the
industries in which we participate.

We rely on third-party distributors and retailers to sell
certain of our products.

In addition to our own distribution force, we offer our products
through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers.
Certain of our distributors market products that compete with
the Company’s products. The loss, termination or failure of
one or more of our distributors to effectively promote our
products could affect the Company’s ability to bring its
products to market. Changes in the financial or business
condition of these distributors and retailers could also subject
the Company to losses.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We outsource the manufacturing of many of our components and
products, and if third-party manufacturers’ lack sufficient
quality control or if there are significant changes in the
financial or business condition of such third-party
manufacturers, it may have a material adverse effect on our
business.

We manufacture many of the components used in our products, but
also increasingly depend on outsourced manufacturing, primarily
by manufacturers located outside of the United States. Our
increasing dependence on third party manufacturers for
outsourced components subjects us to the risk of supplier
failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality or
performance of our products containing such purchased
components. Quality or performance failures by our third-party
manufacturers or changes in their financial or business
condition could disrupt our ability to supply quality products
to our customers and thereby have a material adverse effect on
our business.

In addition, the trend of consolidation is also present amongst
outsource manufacturers in the electronic component industry.
The consolidation of our third-party manufacturers for
outsourced components may increase our cost of component parts.

The level of returns on pension and retirement plan assets
could affect our earnings in future periods.

The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by
the performance of the financial markets, particularly the
equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are
determined under ERISA and are measured each year based on the
value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the
financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are
expected under the ERISA funding calculation, we could be
required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can
be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our
estimate of future contribution requirements can change
dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly,
changes in interest rates can impact our contribution
requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood
of required contributions in the future increases.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance
and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.

Compliance with changing laws, regulations and standards
relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,
including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations
and changes to the New York Stock Exchange rules, has required
us to expend significant resources and incur additional expenses
and will continue to do so. We are committed to maintaining the
highest standards of corporate governance and public disclosure.
As a result, we will continue to invest necessary resources to
comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this
investment may result in increased general and administrative
expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from
revenue-generating activities.

The level at which design wins become actual orders and
sales.

A “design win” occurs when a customer or prospective
customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be
integrated with the customer’s product. There can be delays
of several months or more between the design win and when a
customer initiates actual orders. The design win may never
become an actual order or sale. Further, if the customer’s
plans change, we may commit significant resources to design wins
that do not result in actual orders.

The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of
our income tax returns by the IRS.

We are subject to continued examination of our income tax
returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no
assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations
will not have an adverse effect on future operating results.

Indemnification by Freescale Semiconductor for certain
circumstances arising after the spin-off is limited by their
ability to pay.

We have entered into several agreements with Freescale
Semiconductor, Inc., our former subsidiary. These agreements
address tax sharing, indemnification and insurance, among other
matters. In certain circumstances,



Freescale will indemnify us for liabilities. However, our
ability to recoup such indemnification is limited by
Freescale’s ability to pay.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk

Foreign Currency Risk

As a multinational company, the Company’s transactions are
denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses
financial instruments to hedge, and therefore attempts to reduce
its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on
cash flows. The Company’s policy is not to speculate in
financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price
fluctuation, trade in currencies for which there are no
underlying exposures, or enter into trades for any currency to
intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
are designated as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated
as a hedge at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the
hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
is to offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments
against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
or investments based on the operating business units’
assessment of risk. Almost all of the Company’s
non-functional currency receivables and payables, which are
denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open
markets, are hedged. The Company uses forward contracts and
options to hedge these currency exposures. In addition, the
Company hedges some firmly committed transactions and some
forecasted transactions. The Company expects that it may hedge
investments in foreign subsidiaries in the future. A portion of
the Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not
traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent
reasonably possible, through managing net asset positions,
product pricing, and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had net
outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
$3.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not
subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and
transactions being hedged except for the ineffective portion of
the instruments which are charged to Other within Other
Income(Expense) in the Company’s consolidated



statements of operations. The following table shows, in millions
of U.S. dollars, the five largest net foreign exchange
hedge positions as of December 31, 2004 compared to their
respective positions at December 31, 2003:

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
obligations. However, the Company does not expect any
counterparties, which presently have high credit ratings, to
fail to meet their obligations.

Foreign exchange financial instruments that are subject to the
effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect reported
earnings include derivative financial instruments and other
financial instruments, which are not denominated in the currency
of the legal entity holding the instrument. Derivative financial
instruments consist primarily of forward contracts. Other
financial instruments, which are not denominated in the currency
of the legal entity holding the instrument, consist primarily of
cash, short-term investments, long-term finance receivables,
equity investments, and notes as well as accounts payable and
receivable. Accounts payable and receivable are reflected at
fair value in the financial statements. The fair value of the
remainder of the foreign exchange financial instruments would
hypothetically decrease by $303 million as of
December 31, 2004 if the U.S. dollar were to
appreciate against all other currencies by 10% of current
levels. This hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on
future cash flows under the following conditions: (i) all
current payables and receivables that are hedged were not
realized, (ii) all hedged commitments and anticipated
transactions were not realized or canceled, and
(iii) hedges of these amounts were not canceled or offset.
The Company does not expect that any of these conditions will be
realized. The Company expects that gains and losses on the
derivative financial instruments should offset gains and losses
on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged.
If the hedged transactions were included in the sensitivity
analysis, the hypothetical change in fair value would be
immaterial. The foreign exchange financial instruments are held
for purposes other than trading.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company recorded expense (income) of $(0.1) million,
$(3) million and $2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of fair value hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other Income (Expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company excluded the
change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the
changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward
price from the measure of effectiveness as these amounts are
charged to Other within Other Income(Expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Expense
(income) related to fair value hedges that were discontinued for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are
included in the amounts noted above.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company recorded expense (income) of $11.9 million,
$(1.5) million and $(0.1) million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other Income (Expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company excluded the
change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the
changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward
price from the measure of effectiveness as these amounts are
charged to Other within Other Income (Expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Expense
(income) related to cash flow hedges that were discontinued for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are
included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, on
a pre-tax basis, expense (income) of $27 million,
$(1) million and $(10) million, respectively, was
reclassified from equity to earnings and is included in Other
within Other Income (Expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. If exchange rates do not change from
year-end, the Company estimates that $90 million of pre-tax
net derivative losses included in



Non-Owner Changes to Equity within Stockholders’ Equity
would be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve
months and will be reclassified in the same period that the
hedged item affects earnings. The actual amounts that will be
reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months will vary
from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions.

At December 31, 2004, the maximum term of derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was four years.
However, on average, the duration of the Company’s
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
five months.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not have any
hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
foreign operations. However, the Company expects that it may
hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries in the future.

Investments Hedge

In March 2003, the Company entered into three agreements with
multiple investment banks to hedge up to 25 million of its
shares of Nextel Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”)
common stock. The three agreements are to be settled over
periods of three, four and five years, respectively. Under these
agreements, the Company received no initial proceeds, but has
retained the right to receive, at any time during the contract
periods, the present value of the aggregate contract
“floor” price. Pursuant to these agreements and
exclusive of any present value discount, the Company is entitled
to receive aggregate proceeds of approximately
$333 million. The precise number of shares of Nextel common
stock that the Company would deliver to satisfy the contracts is
dependent upon the price of Nextel common stock on the various
settlement dates. The maximum aggregate number of shares the
Company would be required to deliver under these agreements is
25 million and the minimum number of shares is
18.5 million. Alternatively, the Company has the exclusive
option to settle the contracts in cash. The Company will retain
all voting rights associated with the up to 25 million
hedged Nextel shares. Pursuant to customary market practice, the
covered shares are pledged to secure the hedge contracts. The
Company has recorded $340 million and $310 million as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in Other
Liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets to reflect the
fair value of the Nextel hedge.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
long-term finance receivables, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt, foreign currency
contracts and other financing commitments.

Using available market information, the Company determined that
the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2004 was
$5.4 billion compared to a carrying value of
$5.0 billion. Since considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term
debt is not necessarily indicative of the amount which could be
realized in a current market exchange.

The fair values of the other financial instruments were not
materially different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2004.

Equity Price Market Risk

The value of the available-for-sale securities would change by
$290 million as of year-end 2004 if the price of the stock
in each of the publicly-traded companies were to change by 10%.
These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s short-term debt of
$317 million consisted primarily of $300 million of
commercial paper, priced at short-term interest rates. The
Company had $5.0 billion of long-term debt including
current maturities, which is primarily priced at long-term,
fixed interest rates.



In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
payments. During the year ended December 31, 2004, in
conjunction with the retirement of debt, certain of these swaps
were unwound resulting in income of approximately
$55 million, which is included in Charges Related to Debt
Redemption included in Other within Other Income (Expense) in
the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The
following table displays the interest rate swaps that were in
place at December 31, 2004:

In addition, in June 1999, the Company’s finance subsidiary
entered into interest rate swaps to change the characteristics
of interest rate payments on all $500 million of its 6.75%
Debentures due 2004 from fixed-rate payments to short-term
LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to match the funding
with its underlying assets. This interest rate swap expired in
June 2004, when the underlying fixed-rate debt matured and
was repaid.

The short-term LIBOR-based variable rate on each of the above
interest rate swaps was 5.4% for the three months ended
December 31, 2004. The fair value of all interest rate
swaps at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately
$3 million and $150 million, respectively. The fair
value of the interest rate swaps would hypothetically decrease
by $53 million if LIBOR rates were to increase by 10% from
current levels. Except for these interest rate swaps, the
Company had no outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps
or options relating to debt instruments at December 31,
2004 and 2003.

The Company designates its interest rate hedge arrangements as
hedges of the fair value of fixed-rate debt. Interest expense on
the debt is adjusted to include the payments made or received
under such hedge agreements.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counter-parties to its swap contracts. The
Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
dealing with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions
having long-term debt ratings of “A” or better and,
therefore, does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the
contracts are distributed among several financial institutions,
thus minimizing credit risk concentration.

Environmental Matters

Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment, has no material
effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive
position of Motorola.

Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Motorola, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MOTOROLA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and all
majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s investments in
non-controlled entities in which it has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are
accounted for by the equity method. The Company’s
investments in other entities are accounted for using the cost
method.

Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue for
product sales when title transfers, the risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred to the customer, the fee is
fixed and determinable, and collection of the related receivable
is probable, which is generally at the time of shipment.
Accruals are established, with the related reduction to revenue,
for allowances for discounts and price protection, product
returns and incentive programs for distributors and end
customers related to these sales based on actual historical
exposure at the time the related revenues are recognized. For
long-term contracts, the Company uses the
percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenues and costs
based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to
the total estimated contract costs. For contracts involving new
unproven technologies, revenues and profits are deferred until
technological feasibility is established, customer acceptance is
obtained and other contract-specific terms have been completed.
Provisions for losses are recognized during the period in which
the loss first becomes apparent. Revenue for services is
recognized ratably over the contract term or as services are
being performed. Revenue related to licensing agreements is
recognized over the licensing period or at the time the Company
has fulfilled its obligations and the fee to be received is
fixed and determinable.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of
average cost (which approximates computation on a first-in,
first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement
cost).

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is recorded using declining-balance and
straight-line methods, based on the estimated useful lives of
the assets (buildings and building equipment, 5-40 years;
machinery and equipment, 2-12 years) and commences once the
assets are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill is not
amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least
annually as of October. Intangible assets continue to be
amortized over their respective estimated useful lives ranging
from 2 to 13 years. The Company has no intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

Long-lived assets held
and used by the Company and intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The
Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used
by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net
undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
calculated using a discounted future cash flows analysis. Assets
held for sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Investments:

Investments include, principally,
available-for-sale equity securities at fair value,
held-to-maturity debt securities at amortized cost, securities
that are restricted for more than one year or not publicly
traded at cost, and equity method investments. For the
available-for-sale equity securities, any unrealized holding
gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, are excluded from
operating results and are recognized as a separate component of
Stockholders’ Equity until realized. The fair values of the
securities are determined based on prevailing market prices. The
Company assesses declines in the value of individual investments
to determine whether such decline is other-than-temporary and
thus the investment is impaired. This assessment is made by
considering available evidence including changes in general
market conditions, specific industry and individual company
data, the length of time and the extent to which the market
value has been less than cost, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the individual company, and the
Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment.

Deferred Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the
realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation
allowance is recorded for the



NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MOTOROLA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be
realized based on the level of historical taxable income,
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which
the temporary differences are deductible and allowable tax
planning strategies.

Finance Receivables:

Finance receivables include trade
receivables where contractual terms of the note agreement are
greater than one year. Finance receivables are considered
impaired when management determines it is probable that the
Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
the contractual terms of the note agreement, including principal
and interest. Impaired finance receivables are valued based on
the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at
the receivable’s effective rate of interest, or the fair
value of the collateral if the receivable is collateral
dependent. Interest income and late fees on impaired finance
receivables are recognized only when payments are received.
Previously impaired finance receivables are no longer considered
impaired and are reclassified to performing when they have
performed under a work out or restructuring for four consecutive
quarters.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments:

The fair values of
financial instruments are determined based on quoted market
prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting
period. The Company’s financial instruments include cash
and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt, foreign
currency contracts and other financing commitments. The fair
values of these financial instruments were, with the exception
of long-term debt as disclosed in Note 5, not materially
different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Many of the Company’s
non-U.S. operations use the respective local currencies as
the functional currency. Those non-U.S. operations which do
not use the local currency as the functional currency use the
U.S. dollar. The effects of translating the financial
position and results of operations of local currency functional
operations into U.S. dollars are included in a separate
component of Stockholders’ Equity.

Foreign Currency Transactions:

The effects of remeasuring
the non-functional currency assets or liabilities into the
functional currency, as well as gains and losses on hedges of
existing assets, or liabilities are marked-to-market and the
result is included within Other Income (Expense) in the
consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on
financial instruments that hedge firm future commitments are
deferred until such time as the underlying transactions are
recognized or recorded immediately when the transaction is no
longer expected to occur. Gains or losses on financial
instruments that do not qualify as hedges under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” are
recognized immediately as income or expense.

Stock Compensation Costs:

The Company measures
compensation cost for stock options and restricted stock using
the intrinsic value-based method. Compensation cost, if any, is
recorded based on the excess of the quoted market price at grant
date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
The Company has evaluated the pro forma effects of using the
fair value-based method of accounting and has presented below
the pro forma effects on both earnings (loss) from continuing
operations and on net earnings (loss), which includes
discontinued operations.

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

The weighted-average fair value of options granted was $7.74,
$3.21, and $5.04 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair
value of each option is estimated at the date of grant using a
modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively: dividend yields of 0.9%, 1.8% and 1.3%; expected
volatility of 46.8%, 46.6% and 45.1%; risk-free interest rate of
3.7%, 2.6% and 3.8%; and expected lives of 5 years for each
grant.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts in prior years’
financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to
conform to the 2004 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement No. 123R
(“SFAS 123R”), a revision to Statement
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” This standard requires the Company to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards.
The cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the
vesting period of the awards. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS 123R at the beginning of the third quarter, 2005. The
standard provides for a prospective application. Under this
method, the Company will begin recognizing compensation cost for
equity based compensation for all new or modified grants after
the date of adoption. In addition, the Company will recognize
the unvested portion of the grant date fair value of awards
issued prior to adoption based on the fair values previously
calculated for disclosure purposes. At December 31, 2004,
the aggregate value of unvested options, as determined using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model, was $540 million.
Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the majority of this amount
will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of these
options.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” (“SFAS 151”).
SFAS 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage, be charged to
expense in the period they are incurred rather than capitalized
as a component of inventory costs. Statement 151 is
effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this
standard may result in higher expenses in periods where
production levels are lower than normal ranges of production.
Because actual future production levels are subject to many
factors, including demand for the Company’s products, the
Company cannot determine if the adoption of SFAS 151 will
have a material impact on future results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,”
(“SFAS 153”). SFAS 153 amends Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 29,
“Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” to require
exchanges of nonmonetary assets be accounted for at fair value,
rather than carryover basis. Nonmonetary exchanges that lack
commercial substance are exempt from this requirement.
SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges entered
into in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The
Company does not routinely enter into exchanges that could be
considered nonmonetary, accordingly the Company does not expect
the adoption of SFAS 153 to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

2. Discontinued Operations

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company completed the
separation of its semiconductor operations into a separate
subsidiary, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale
Semiconductor”). Under the terms of the Master Separation
and Distribution Agreement entered into between Motorola and
Freescale Semiconductor, Freescale Semiconductor has agreed to
indemnify Motorola for substantially all past, present and
future liabilities associated with the semiconductor business.
In July 2004, an initial public offering (“IPO”) of a
minority interest of approximately 32.5% of Freescale
Semiconductor was completed. As a result of the IPO the company
recorded additional paid-in capital of $397 million related
to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares
sold. Concurrently in July 2004, Freescale Semiconductor issued
senior debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of
$1.25 billion. On December 2, 2004, Motorola completed
the spin-off of its remaining 67.5% equity interest in Freescale
Semiconductor. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata
non-cash dividend to Motorola stockholders, which reduced
retained earnings by $2.5 billion. Holders of Motorola
stock at the close of business on November 26, 2004
received a dividend of .110415 shares of Freescale
Semiconductor Class B common stock per share of Motorola
common stock. No fractional shares of Freescale Semiconductor
were issued. Stockholders

entitled to fractional shares of Freescale Semiconductor
Class B common stock in the distribution received the cash
value instead. The equity distribution was structured to be
tax-free to Motorola stockholders for U.S. tax purposes (other
than with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional
shares). The historical results of Freescale Semiconductor have
been reflected as discontinued operations in the underlying
financial statements and related disclosures for all periods
presented. As a result, the historical footnote disclosures have
been revised to exclude amounts related to Freescale
Semiconductor.

4. Debt and Credit Facilities

Long-Term Debt

Short-Term Debt

In August 2004, the Company completed the open market purchase
of $110 million of the $409 million aggregate
principal amount outstanding of its 6.50% Debentures due
2028 (the “2028 Debentures”). The $110 million
principal amount of 2028 Debentures was purchased for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $115 million.

In August 2004, pursuant to the terms of the 7.00% Equity
Security Units (the “MEUs”), the $1.2 billion of
6.50% Senior Notes due 2007 (the “2007 MEU
Notes”) that comprised a portion of the MEUs were
remarketed to a new set of holders. In connection with the
remarketing, the interest rate on the 2007 MEU Notes was reset
to 4.608%. None of the other terms of the 2007 MEU Notes were
changed. Shortly after the remarketing, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps to change the characteristics of the
interest rate payments from fixed-rate payments to short-term
LIBOR-based variable rate payments. Additionally, in November
2004, pursuant to the terms of the MEUs, the Company sold 69.4
million shares of common stock to the holders of the MEUs. The
purchase price per share was $17.30 resulting in aggregate
proceeds of $1.2 billion.

In July 2004, the Company commenced a cash tender offer for any
and all of the $300 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding of its 7.60% Notes due 2007 (the “2007
Notes”). The tender offer expired in August 2004 and an
aggregate principal amount of approximately $182 million of
2007 Notes was validly tendered. In August 2004, the Company
repurchased the validly tendered 2007 Notes for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $202 million. This debt was
repurchased with proceeds distributed to the Company by
Freescale Semiconductor.



NOTES TO

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

In July 2004, the Company called for the redemption of the
$1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
6.75% Debentures due 2006 (the “2006
Debentures”). All of the 2006 Debentures were redeemed in
August 2004 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$1.5 billion. This debt was redeemed partially with
proceeds distributed to the Company by Freescale Semiconductor
and partially with available cash balances.

In June 2004, the Company repaid, at maturity, all
$500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
6.75% Debentures due 2004.

In March 2004, Motorola Capital Trust I, a Delaware
statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (the “Trust”), redeemed all outstanding Trust
Originated Preferred
Securities

sm

(“TOPrS”). In February 1999, the Trust sold
20 million TOPrS to the public for an aggregate offering
price of $500 million. The Trust used the proceeds from
that sale, together with the proceeds from its sale of common
stock to the Company, to buy a series of 6.68% Deferrable
Interest Junior Subordinated Debentures due March 31, 2039
(the “Subordinated Debentures”) from the Company with
the same payment terms as the TOPrS. The sole assets of the
Trust were the Subordinated Debentures. Historically, the TOPrS
have been reflected as “Company-Obligated Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding
Solely Company-Guaranteed Debentures” in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. On March 26, 2004, all
outstanding TOPrS were redeemed for an aggregate redemption
price of $500 million plus accrued interest. No TOPrS or
Subordinated Debentures remain outstanding.

In March 2004, the Company also redeemed all outstanding Liquid
Yield Option Notes due September 7, 2009 (the “2009
LYONs”) and all outstanding Liquid Yield Option Notes due
September 27, 2013 (the “2013 LYONs”). On
March  26, 2004, all then-outstanding 2009 LYONs and
2013 LYONs, not validly exchanged for stock, were redeemed for
an aggregate redemption price of approximately $4 million.
No 2009 LYONs or 2013 LYONs remain outstanding.

In September 2003, the Company announced the conclusion of its
offer to purchase its 2013 LYONs. Pursuant to the indenture
under which the 2013 LYONs were issued in September 1993, the
holders’ option to surrender the 2013 LYONs for repurchase
that began on August 29, 2003 expired on September 29,
2003. 2013 LYONs with an aggregate principal amount at maturity
of approximately $98 million were validly tendered and
repurchased by Motorola. This left an aggregate principal amount
of approximately $4 million of 2013 LYONs outstanding. The
purchase price for the LYONs was $799.52 per $1,000
principal amount at maturity. Accordingly, the aggregate
purchase price for all of the LYONs that were validly tendered
was approximately $78 million. Motorola paid the purchase
price with available cash.

In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with
Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“Goldman”) to
repurchase all of the Company’s $825 million of
Puttable Reset Securities
(PURS)

sm

due February 1, 2011 from Goldman. At that time, the
Company paid Goldman $106 million to terminate
Goldman’s annual remarketing rights associated with the
PURS. This charge was included in Other within Other Income
(Expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations. In February 2003, the Company purchased the
$825 million of PURS from Goldman with cash on hand.

Aggregate requirements for long-term debt maturities (assuming
earliest put date) during the next five years are as follows:
2005-$400 million; 2006-$2 million;
2007-$1.3 billion; 2008-$527 million;
2009-$2 million.

In May 2004, the Company signed a new 3 year revolving
credit agreement for $1 billion, replacing two existing
facilities totaling $1.6 billion. At December 31,
2004, the commitment fee assessed against the daily average
amounts unused was 17.5 basis points. Important terms of
the credit agreement include covenants relating to net interest
coverage and total debt to book capitalization ratios. The
Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement
at December 31, 2004. The Company’s current corporate
credit ratings are “BBB” with a “positive”
outlook by S&P, “Baa3” with a “positive”
outlook by Moody’s, and “BBB+” with a
“positive” outlook by Fitch. The Company has never
borrowed under its domestic revolving credit facilities. The
Company also has $1.9 billion of non-U.S. credit
facilities with interest rates on borrowings varying from
country to country depending upon local market conditions. At
December 31, 2004, the Company’s total domestic and
non-U.S. credit facilities totaled $2.9 billion, of
which $76 million was considered utilized.

5. Risk Management

Derivative Financial Instruments

Foreign Currency Risk

As a multinational company, the Company’s transactions are
denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses
financial instruments to hedge, and therefore attempts to reduce
its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on
cash flows. The Company’s policy is not to speculate in
financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price
fluctuation, trade in currencies for which there are no
underlying exposures, or enter into trades for any currency to
intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
are designated as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated
as a hedge at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the
hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
is to offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments
against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
or investments based on the operating business units’
assessment of risk. Almost all of the Company’s
non-functional currency receivables and payables, which are
denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open
markets, are hedged. The Company uses forward contracts and
options to hedge these currency exposures. In addition, the
Company hedges some firmly committed transactions and some
forecasted transactions. The Company expects that it may hedge
investments in foreign subsidiaries in the future. A portion of
the Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not
traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent
reasonably possible, through managing net asset positions,
product pricing, and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had net
outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
$3.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not
subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and
transactions being hedged except for the ineffective portion of
the instruments which are charged to Other within Other Income
(Expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations. The following table shows, in millions of
U.S. dollars, the five largest net foreign exchange hedge
positions as of December 31, 2004 compared to their
respective positions at December 31, 2003:

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
obligations. However, it does not expect any counterparties,
which presently have high credit ratings, to fail to meet their
obligations.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s short-term debt of
$317 million consisted primarily of $300 million of
commercial paper, priced at short-term interest rates. The
Company had $5.0 billion of long-term debt including
current maturities, which is primarily priced at long-term,
fixed interest rates.



NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MOTOROLA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
payments. During the year ended December 31, 2004, in
conjunction with the retirement of debt, certain of these swaps
were unwound resulting in income of approximately
$55 million, which is included in Charges Related to Debt
Redemption included in Other within Other Income (Expense) in
the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The
following table displays the interest rate swaps that were in
place at December 31, 2004:

In addition, in June 1999, the Company’s finance subsidiary
entered into interest rate swaps to change the characteristics
of interest rate payments on all $500 million of its 6.75%
Debentures due 2004 from fixed-rate payments to short-term
LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to match the funding
with its underlying assets. This interest rate swap expired in
June 2004, when the underlying fixed-rate debt matured and was
repaid.

The short-term LIBOR-based variable rate on each of the above
interest rate swaps was 5.4% for the three months ended
December 31, 2004. The fair value of all interest rate
swaps at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately
$3 million and $150 million, respectively. Except for
these interest rate swaps, the Company had no outstanding
commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options relating to
debt instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The Company designates its interest rate hedge arrangements as
hedges of the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. Interest
expense on the debt is adjusted to include the payments made or
received under such hedge agreements.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
dealing with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions
having long-term debt ratings of “A” or better and,
therefore, does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the
contracts are distributed among several financial institutions,
thus minimizing credit risk concentration.

of operations. Expense (income) related to fair value
hedges that were discontinued for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are included in the
amounts noted above.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company recorded expense (income) of $11.9 million,
$(1.5) million and $(0.1) million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other Income (Expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company excluded the
change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the
changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward
price from the measure of effectiveness as these amounts are
charged to Other within Other Income (Expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Expense
(income) related to cash value hedges that were
discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 are included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, on
a pre-tax basis, expense (income) of $27 million,
$(1) million and $(10) million, respectively, was
reclassified from equity to earnings and is included in Other
within Other Income (Expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. If exchange rates do not change from
year-end, the Company estimates that $90 million of pre-tax
net derivative losses included in Non-Owner Changes to Equity
within Stockholders’ Equity would be reclassified into
earnings within the next twelve months and will be reclassified
in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings. The
actual amounts that will be reclassified into earnings over the
next twelve months will vary from this amount as a result of
changes in market conditions.

At December 31, 2004, the maximum term of derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was four years.
However, on average, the duration of the Company’s
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
five months.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not have any
hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
foreign operations. However, the Company expects that it may
hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries in the future.

Investments Hedge

In March 2003, the Company entered into three agreements with
multiple investment banks to hedge up to 25 million of its
shares of common stock of Nextel Communications, Inc.
(“Nextel”). The three agreements are to be settled
over periods of three, four and five years, respectively. Under
these agreements, the Company received no initial proceeds, but
has retained the right to receive, at any time during the
contract periods, the present value of the aggregate contract
“floor” price. Pursuant to these agreements, and
exclusive of any present value discount, the Company is entitled
to receive aggregate proceeds of approximately
$333 million. The precise number of shares of Nextel common
stock that the Company will deliver to satisfy the contracts is
dependent upon the price of Nextel common stock on the various
settlement dates. The maximum aggregate number of shares the
Company would be required to deliver under these agreements is
25 million and the minimum number of shares is
18.5 million. Alternatively, the Company has the exclusive
option to settle the contracts in cash. The Company will retain
all voting rights associated with the up to 25 million
hedged Nextel shares. Pursuant to customary market practice, the
covered shares are pledged to secure the hedge contracts. The
Company has recorded $340 million and $310 million as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in Other
Liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet to reflect the
fair value of the Nextel hedge.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
long-term finance receivables, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt, foreign currency
contracts and other financing commitments.

Using available market information, the Company determined that
the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2004 was
$5.4 billion compared to a carrying value of
$5.0 billion. Since considerable judgment is

required in interpreting market information, the fair value of
the long-term debt is not necessarily indicative of the amount
which could be realized in a current market exchange.

The fair values of the other financial instruments were not
materially different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2004.

Components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:

Deferred tax charges (benefits) that were recorded within
Non-Owner Changes to Equity in the consolidated balance sheets
resulted primarily from fair value adjustments to
available-for-sale securities, losses on derivative instruments
and minimum pension liability adjustments. The adjustments were
$(189) million, $440 million and $(136) million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Except for certain earnings that the Company
intends to reinvest indefinitely, provisions have been made for
the estimated U.S. federal income taxes applicable to
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Undistributed earnings that the Company intends to reinvest
indefinitely, and for which no U.S. Federal income taxes
has been provided, aggregate $5.6 billion,
$5.1 billion and $6.6 billion at December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The portion of earnings not
reinvested indefinitely may be distributed substantially free of
additional U.S. federal income taxes given the
U.S. federal tax provisions accrued on undistributed
earnings and the utilization of available foreign tax credits.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provides for a favorable,
one-time deduction for qualifying repatriations of foreign
earnings if made in 2004 or 2005. The Company has not yet
completed its evaluation of the effect of the new tax law on its
plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings. The
Company will evaluate its repatriation plans and the impact of
the new tax provision throughout 2005.

Differences between income tax expense (benefit) computed at the
U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and income tax
expense (benefit) are as follows:



NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MOTOROLA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

Significant components of deferred tax assets
(liabilities) are as follows:

Gross deferred tax assets were $9.7 billion and
$8.8 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances,
were $8.9 billion and $8.0 billion at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross deferred
tax liabilities were $5.0 billion and $3.9 billion at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company had U.S. tax carryforwards of $1.5 billion and
$1.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. At December 31, 2004, these carryforwards
were comprised of $683 million of net operating loss
carryforwards, $364 million of foreign tax credit
carryovers, $215 million of general business credit
carryovers, $127 million of minimum tax credit
carryforwards and $115 million of capital loss
carryforwards. The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries,
primarily in Germany and the UK, had tax loss carryforwards of
$634 million and $639 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

A majority of the U.S. net operating losses and general business
credits can be carried forward for 20 years, capital losses
can be carried forward for five years and minimum tax credits
can be carried forward indefinitely. The carryforward period for
foreign tax credits was extended to 10 years, from
5 years, during 2004 due to the enactment of the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances for certain state
deferred tax assets, state tax loss carryforwards with
carryforward periods of seven years or less, tax loss
carryforwards of acquired entities that are subject to
limitations and tax loss carryforwards of certain
non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company believes that the
deferred tax assets for the remaining tax carryforwards are
considered more likely than not to be realizable based on
estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax
planning strategies.

During 2004, the Company recorded the reversal of $316 million
of previously-accrued income taxes as a result of settlements
reached with taxing authorities and a reassessment of tax
exposures based on the status of current audits. Of the $316
million reversal, $241 million was recorded as a reduction in
tax expense and $75 million, which related to previously-issued
warrants, was reflected as an increase in Additional Paid-In
Capital in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
During 2003 the Company recorded the reversal of $61 million of
previously-accrued income taxes related to the settlement of tax
audits.

During 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its
field examination of the Company’s 1996 through 2000 tax
returns. In connection with this examination, the Company
received notices of certain adjustments proposed by the IRS,
primarily related to transfer pricing. The Company disagrees
with these proposed transfer pricing-related adjustments and
intends to vigorously dispute this matter through applicable IRS
and judicial procedures, as appropriate. However, if the IRS
were to ultimately prevail on all matters relating to transfer
pricing for the period of the examination, it could result in
additional taxable income for the years 1996 through 2000 of
approximately $1.4 billion, which could result in
additional income tax liability for the Company of approximately
$500 million. The IRS may make similar claims for years
subsequent to 2000 in future audits. Although the final
resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain, based on
current information, in the opinion of the Company’s
management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of
operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a



NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MOTOROLA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the
period in which the matter is ultimately resolved.

7. Employee Benefit and Incentive Plans

Pension Benefits

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the Regular
Pension Plan) covers most U.S. employees who become
eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula is
dependent upon employee earnings and years of service. Effective
January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees will not be eligible
to participate in the Regular Pension Plan.

The Company has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
benefit plan (the Officers’ Plan) for its elected officers.
The Officers’ Plan contains provisions for funding the
participants’ expected retirement benefits when the
participants meet the minimum age and years of service
requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the
Officers’ Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option
to remain in the Officers’ Plan or elect to have their
benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective
December 31, 1999, no new elected officers were eligible to
participate in the Officers’ Plan.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
retirement benefit plan (the Motorola Supplemental Pension
Plan—MSPP), which provides supplemental benefits, to
certain employees, in excess of the limitations imposed by the
Internal Revenue Code on the Regular Pension Plan. Elected
officers covered under the Officers’ Plan or who
participated in the restricted stock buy-out are not eligible to
participate in MSPP. Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired
employees will not be eligible to participate in MSPP.

The Company also provides defined benefit plans to employees of
some of its foreign entities. The information below for Non
U.S. plans covers the Company’s principal foreign
plans; any other plans are not significant to the Company either
individually or in the aggregate.

The net periodic pension cost for the regular pension plan,
officers’ plan, MSPP and Non U.S. plans was as follows:

assets have been measured as of December 31, 2004 for all
U.S. plans and as of October 1, 2004 for all Non

Discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates
for high-quality fixed-income instruments that, if the pension
benefit obligation was settled at the measurement date, would
provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit
obligation when due. At December 31, 2004, the Regular
Pension Plan investment portfolio was predominantly equity
investments and the Officers’ Pension Plan investment
portfolio was predominantly fixed-income securities. The Company
uses long-term historical actual return experience with
consideration to the expected investment mix of the plans’
assets, and future estimates of long-term investment returns to
develop its expected rate of return assumption used in
calculating the net periodic pension cost.

Negative financial market returns during 2000 through 2002
resulted in a decline in the fair-market value of plan assets.
This, when combined with declining discount rate assumptions in
the last several years, has resulted in a decline in the
plans’ funded status. Consequently, the Company’s
accumulated benefits obligation exceeded the fair-market value
of the plan assets for various plans including the Regular
Pension Plan, the Officers’ Pension Plan and certain
non-U.S. plans.

The accumulated benefit obligations for the plans were as
follows:

As required, after-tax charges of $188 million,
$182 million and $647 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
recorded to reflect the net change in the Company’s
additional minimum pension liability associated with these
plans. This charge was included in Non-Owner Changes to Equity
in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has adopted a pension investment policy designed to
meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets
assumption. To achieve this, the pension plans retain
professional investment managers that invest plan assets in
equity and fixed income securities and cash. In addition, some
plans invest in insurance contracts. The Company has the
following target mixes for these asset classes, which are
readjusted at least quarterly, when an asset class weighting
deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the
required return at a reasonable risk level as follows:

Within the equity securities asset class, the investment policy
provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded
securities including both domestic and international stocks.
Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment
policy provides for investments in a broad range of
publicly-traded debt securities ranging from US Treasury issues,
corporate debt securities, mortgages and asset-backed issues, as
well as international debt securities. In the cash and other
investments asset class, investments may be in cash, cash
equivalents or insurance contracts.

The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately
$150 million to its U.S. pension plans and
$45 million to its Non-U.S. pension plans in 2005.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Postretirement Health Care Benefits

Certain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic
employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
termination of employment. For eligible employees hired prior to

Stock Compensation Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through
payroll deductions of up to 10% of compensation on an after-tax
basis. The price an employee pays per share is 85% of the lower
of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the
close of the first trading day or last trading day of the
purchase period. The plan has two purchase periods, the first
one from October 1 through March 31 and the second one
from April 1 through September 30. For the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, employees purchased
13.1 million, 20.5 million and 16.1 million
shares, respectively, at prices ranging from $10.31 to $15.33,
$7.02 to $7.10 and $8.65 to $12.07, respectively.

Stock Options

Under the Company’s stock option plans, options to acquire
shares of common stock have been made available for grant to
certain employees, non-employee directors and to existing option
holders in connection with the merging of option plans following
an acquisition. Each option granted has an exercise price of
100% of the market value of the common stock on the date of
grant. The majority of the options have a contractual life of
10 years and vest and become exercisable at 25% increments
over four years.

Upon the occurrence of a change in control, each stock option
outstanding on the date on which the change in control occurs
will immediately become exercisable in full.

On December 2, 2004, in connection with the distribution of
Freescale Semiconductor to Motorola shareholders, certain
adjustments were made to outstanding stock options. For vested
and unvested options held by Motorola employees and vested
options held by Freescale Semiconductor employees, the number of
underlying shares and the exercise price of the options were
adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value and the ratio of the
exercise price to the fair market value of an underlying share
that existed immediately prior to the distribution. In addition,
the contractual life of the vested options held by Freescale
Semiconductor employees was truncated according to the terms of
the original grant. Unvested options held by Freescale
Semiconductor employees expired according to the terms of the
original grants. No other adjustments were made to the terms of
the original option grants.

$32 million, respectively.

Other Benefits

Defined Contribution Plans:

The Company and
certain subsidiaries have various defined contribution plans, in
which all eligible employees participate. The Company generally
makes two types of contributions to these plans, matching
contributions and profit sharing contributions.

In the U.S., the profit sharing and savings plan is a
contributory plan. Matching contributions are based upon the
amount of the employees’ contributions and do not depend on
the Company’s profits. Effective January 1, 2005,
newly hired employees will have a higher maximum matching
contribution at 4% on the first 6% of employee contributions,
compared to 3% for employees hired prior to January 2005. Profit
sharing contributions are generally based upon pre-tax earnings,
as defined, with an adjustment for the aggregate matching
contribution. Effective January 1, 2005, the plan has been
amended to exclude the profit-sharing component.

Company contributions, primarily relating to the employer match,
to all plans for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 were $74 million, $67 million and
$73 million, respectively. The profit sharing contribution
for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $69 million.
There was no profit sharing contribution for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Motorola Incentive Plan:

The Motorola Incentive
Plan provides eligible employees with an annual payment,
calculated as a percentage of an employee’s eligible
earnings, in the year after the close of the current calendar
year if specified business goals are met. The provision for
awards under these incentive plans for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $771 million,
$422 million and $263 million, respectively.

Mid-Range Incentive Plan:

In 2003, the Long Range
Incentive Program was replaced by the Mid-Range Incentive Plan
(MRIP). MRIP rewards participating elected officers for the
Company’s achievement of outstanding performance during the
period, based on two performance objectives measured over
two-year cycles. The provision for MRIP for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $56 million and
$5 million, respectively. Prior to 2003, the Company’s
Long Range Incentive Program of 1994 rewarded participating
elected officers for the Company’s achievement of
outstanding long-range performance, based on four performance
objectives measured over four-year cycles. There was no
provision for the year ended December 31, 2002.

“Telsim Loan”). The decline represents partial
recovery of amounts owed of $44 million due to collection
efforts. As a result of difficulties in collecting the amounts
due from Telsim, the Company has previously recorded charges
reducing the net receivable from Telsim to zero. At both
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the net receivable from Telsim
was zero. Although the Company continues to vigorously pursue
its recovery efforts, it believes the litigation, collection
and/or settlement process will be very lengthy in light of the
Uzans’ (the family which previously controlled Telsim)
continued resistance to satisfy the judgment against them and
their decision to violate various courts’ orders, including
orders holding them in contempt of court. In addition, the
Turkish government has asserted control over Telsim and certain
other interests of the Uzans and this may make the
Company’s collection efforts more difficult.

The Company sells short-term receivables through the Motorola
Receivables Corporation (“MRC”) short-term receivables
program, which provides for up to $425 million of
short-term receivables to be outstanding with third parties at
any time. In October 2004, the Company renewed the MRC
short-term receivables program at its current level for one
year. In addition, the Company sells short-term receivables
directly to third parties. Total short-term receivables sold by
the Company (including those sold directly to third parties and
those sold through the MRC short-term receivables program) were
$3.8 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. There were $1.1 billion and $771 million
of short-term receivables outstanding under these arrangements
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively (including
$255 million and $170 million, respectively, under the
MRC program). The Company’s total credit exposure to
outstanding short-term receivables that have been sold was
$25 million at both December 31, 2004 and 2003 with
reserves of $4 million and $13 million recorded for
potential losses on this exposure at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Certain purchasers of the Company’s infrastructure
equipment continue to request that suppliers provide financing
in connection with equipment purchases. Financing may include
all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment as well
as working capital. The Company had outstanding commitments to
extend credit to third-parties totaling $294 million and
$149 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment
customers the Company also assists customers in obtaining
financing directly from banks and other sources to fund
equipment purchases. The amount of loans from third parties for
which the Company has committed to provide financial guarantees
totaled $8 million and $10 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, with no payments
being made for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
payments of $28 million made by the Company for the year
ended December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 these
financial guarantees are to four customers and are scheduled to
expire by 2013. Customer borrowings outstanding under these
third party loan arrangements were $4 million and
$10 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company had no accrued liabilities recorded at
December 31, 2004 and $1 million at 2003 to reflect
management’s best estimate of probable losses of
unrecoverable amounts, should these guarantees be called.

Legal

Iridium Program:

Motorola has been named as one of
several defendants in putative class action securities lawsuits
arising out of alleged misrepresentations or omissions regarding
the Iridium satellite communications business, which on
March 15, 2001, were consolidated in the District of
Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications,
Inc., et al

., originally filed on April 22, 1999.
On August 31, 2004, the court denied the motions to dismiss
that had been filed on July 15, 2002 by Motorola and the
other defendants.

Motorola has been sued by the Official Committee of the
Unsecured Creditors of Iridium in the Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York on July 19, 2001.

In re
Iridium Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserts
claims for breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty, and
fraudulent transfer and preferences, and seeks in excess of
$4 billion in damages.

The Company has not reserved for any potential liability that
may arise as a result of litigation related to the Iridium
program. While the still pending cases are in various stages and
the outcomes are not predictable, an unfavorable outcome of one
or more of these cases could have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Other:

The Company is a defendant in various other suits,
claims and investigations that arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, and other than discussed
above with respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

Other

The Company is also a party to a variety of agreements pursuant
to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with
respect to certain matters. Some of these obligations arise as a
result of divestitures of the Company’s assets or
businesses and require the Company to hold the other party
harmless against losses arising from adverse tax outcomes. The
total amount of indemnification under these types of provisions
at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $37 million and
$100 million, respectively, with the Company accruing
$2 million and $42 million as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, for certain claims that have been
asserted under these provisions.

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses
that result from the breach of general warranties contained in
certain commercial, intellectual property and divestiture
agreements. Historically the Company has not made significant
payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant
claims asserted against the Company as of December 31, 2004.

In all cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other
party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the
particular contract, which procedures typically allow the
Company to challenge the other party’s claims. Further, the
Company’s obligations under these agreements are generally
limited in terms of duration, typically not more than
24 months, and or amounts not in excess of the contract
value, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse
against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.

Segment operating results are measured based on operating
earnings (loss) adjusted, if necessary, for certain
segment-specific items and corporate allocations. Intersegment
and intergeographic sales are accounted for on an
arm’s-length pricing basis. Intersegment sales included in
adjustments and eliminations were $963 million,
$816 million and $874 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These sales
were primarily from the Integrated Electronic Systems segment to
the Personal Communications segment. Intersegment sales from the
Integrated Electronic Systems segment were $507 million,
$409 million and $424 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net sales
by geographic region are measured by the location of the
revenue-producing operations.

Domestic export sales to third parties were $2.7 billion,
$1.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Domestic
export sales to affiliates and subsidiaries, which are
eliminated in consolidation, were $1.8 billion,
$1.8 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Identifiable assets (excluding intersegment receivables) are the
Company’s assets that are identified with classes of
similar products or operations in each geographic region.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
approximately 10%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of net sales were
to Nextel Communications, Inc. and its affiliates.

11. Stockholder Rights Plan

The terms of the Preferred Share Purchase Rights Agreement
attach certain rights to existing shares of common stock,
$3 par value, of the Company at the rate of one right for
each share of common stock.

Each right entitles a shareholder to buy, under certain
circumstances, one thirty-thousandth of a share of preferred
stock for $66.66. The rights generally will be exercisable only
if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of the
Company’s common stock or begins a tender or exchange offer
for 10 percent or more of the Company’s common stock.
If a person acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the
Company’s common stock, all holders of rights other than
the acquiring person, will be entitled to purchase the
Company’s common stock (or, in certain cases, common
equivalent shares) at a 50% discount. The Company may redeem the
new rights at a price of $0.0033 per right. The rights will
expire on November 20, 2008.

12. Reorganization of Businesses

The Company records provisions for employee separation and exit
costs when they are probable and estimable. The Company
maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (Severance Plan)
which permits Motorola to offer to eligible employees severance
benefits based on years of service in the event that employment
is involuntarily terminated as a result of a reduction-in-force
or restructuring. Each separate reduction-in-force has qualified
for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and therefore,
such benefits are accounted for in accordance with
Statement No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits” (SFAS 112). Under the provisions of
SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefits based
on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that
future settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated
based on estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is
approved by management. Exit costs primarily consist of future
minimum lease payments on vacated facilities. At each reporting
date, the Company evaluates its accruals for exit costs and
employee separation costs to ensure that the accruals are still
appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer
required because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or
because employees previously identified for separation resigned
from the Company and did not receive severance or were
redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original
plans were initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the
Reorganization of Business income statement line item when it is
determined they are no longer required.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2004

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded
net reversals of $12 million for reserves no longer needed,
including $3 million of charges in Costs of Sales and
$15 million of reversals under Reorganization of Businesses
in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Included in the aggregate $12 million of net reversals are
$59 million of charges for employee separation costs,
$66 million of reversals for employee separation and exit
cost reserves no longer needed, and income of $5 million
related to fixed asset adjustments. The additional charges of
$59 million are a result of the Company’s commitment
to productivity improvement plans aimed at improving the
Company’s ability to meet customer demands and reduce
operating costs. The productivity plans are designed to adjust
the Company’s workforce to align it with the Company’s
focus on seamless mobility and to eliminate positions in its
corporate functions in connection with the complete separation
of the Company’s former semiconductor operations into an
entirely independent company, Freescale Semiconductor.
Businesses impacted by these plans include the Commercial,
Government and Industrial Solutions segment, the Integrated
Electronic Systems segment and the Broadband Communications
segment, as well as various corporate functions.

13. Acquisitions and Related Intangibles

The Company accounts for acquisitions using purchase accounting
with the results of operations for each acquiree included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the period
subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of
these acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements were not significant individually nor in the
aggregate.

The allocation of value to in-process research and development
was determined using expected future cash flows discounted at
average risk adjusted rates reflecting both technological and
market risk as well as the time value of money. Historical
pricing, margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used
in the valuation of the in-process products. The in-process
research and development acquired will have no alternative
future uses if the products are not feasible.

The developmental products for the companies acquired have
varying degrees of timing, technology, costs-to-complete and
market risks throughout final development. If the products fail
to become viable, the Company will unlikely be able to realize
any value from the sale of incomplete technology to another
party or through internal re-use. The risks of market acceptance
for the products under development and potential reductions in
projected sales volumes and related profits in the event of
delayed market availability for any of the products exist.
Efforts to complete all developmental products continue and
there are no known delays to forecasted plans.

goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes, a $16 million charge for acquired in-process
research and development, and $20 million in other
intangibles. The acquired in-process research and development
will have no alternative future uses if the products are not
feasible. At the date of the acquisition, a total of three
projects were in process. The average risk adjusted rate used to
value these projects was 45%. The allocation of value to
in-process research and development was determined using
expected future cash flows discounted at average risk adjusted
rates reflecting both technological and market risk as well as
the time value of money. These research and development costs
were written off at the date of acquisition and have been
included in Other Charges in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. Goodwill and intangible assets are
included in Other Assets in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets. The intangible assets will be amortized over a
period of 5 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of MeshNetworks have been included in

next-generation, packet-based mobile switching centers for
wireless networks, for approximately $179 million in cash.

The Company recorded approximately $93 million in goodwill,
none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, a
$32 million charge for acquired in-process research and
development, and $54 million in other intangibles. The
acquired in-process research and development will have no
alternative future uses if the products are not feasible. At the
date of the acquisition, a total of eight projects were in
process. The average risk adjusted rate used to value these
projects ranged from 25% to 28%. The allocation of value to
in-process research and development was determined using
expected future cash flows discounted at average risk adjusted
rates reflecting both technological and market risk as well as
the time value of money. These research and development costs
were written off at the date of acquisition and have been
included in Other Charges in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. Goodwill and intangible assets are
included in Other Assets in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets. The intangible assets will be amortized over
periods ranging from 3 to 5 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of Winphoria have been included in the
Global Telecom Solutions segment in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of
acquisition. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements were not
significant.

Synchronous

In January 2002, the Broadband Communications segment acquired
Synchronous, Inc. (“Synchronous”), a leading provider
of fiber optic systems for video, data and voice transmission.
Approximately 16.2 million shares of the Company’s
common stock were exchanged for Synchronous’ outstanding
shares. The total purchase price was $270 million, which
includes transaction costs.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The Company recorded $194 million in goodwill,
an $11 million charge for acquired in-process research and
development and $60 million in other intangibles. At the
date of acquisition, a total of four projects were in process.
The average risk adjusted rate used to value these projects was
40%. The acquired in-process research and development is
included in Other Charges in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
2002. Goodwill and other intangible assets are included in Other
Assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Other
intangibles are being amortized over periods ranging from 7 to
10 years on a straight-line basis.

Intangible Assets

Amortized intangible assets, excluding goodwill were comprised
of the following:

Amortization expense on intangible assets was $52 million,
$101 million and $66 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Future
amortization expense is estimated to be as follows:
2005—$57 million; 2006—$52 million;
2007—$45 million; 2008—$31 million; and
2009—$22 million.

The following tables display a rollforward of the carrying
amount of goodwill from January 1, 2003 to
December 31, 2004, by business segment:

(Dollars in millions, except as noted)

The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit
level and is a two-step analysis. First, the fair
value (FV) of the reporting unit is compared to its book
value. If the FV of the reporting unit is less than its book
value, the Company performs a hypothetical purchase price
allocation based on the reporting unit’s fair value to
determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill.
Fair value is determined with the help of independent appraisal
firms using a combination of present value techniques and quoted
market prices of comparable businesses. For the year ended
December 31, 2004 the Company determined that goodwill
related to a sensor group within the Other Products segment was
impaired by a total of $125 million. For the year ended
December 31, 2003 the Company determined that goodwill at
the infrastructure reporting unit of the Broadband
Communications segment was impaired by $73 million. No
impairment charges were required for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior
management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report (the “Evaluation Date”).
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the
information relating to Motorola, including our consolidated
subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is
accumulated and communicated to Motorola’s management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.

Motorola’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
senior management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, using the criteria set forth in the

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of
December 31, 2004. KPMG LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on
management’s assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2004 that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures,
that Motorola, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Motorola,
Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Motorola, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Also, in our opinion, Motorola, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated

Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 4,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.
