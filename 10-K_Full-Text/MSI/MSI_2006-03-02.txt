Business Segments

Motorola reports financial results for the following four
operating business segments:

Mobile Devices Segment

The Mobile Devices segment (“Mobile Devices” or the
“segment”) designs, manufactures, sells and services
wireless handsets, with integrated software and accessory
products. In 2005, the segment’s net sales represented 58%
of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

Our wireless subscriber products include wireless handsets, with
related software and accessory products. We market our products
worldwide to carriers and consumers through direct sales,
distributors, dealers, retailers and, in certain markets,
through licensees.

Our Industry

We believe that total industry shipments of wireless handsets
(also referred to as industry “sell-in”) increased to
approximately 815 million units in 2005, an increase of
approximately 17% compared to 2004. Demand from new subscribers
was strong in emerging markets, including China, Latin America
and Eastern Europe. Replacement sales in highly-penetrated
markets were also strong due to generally improved economic
conditions, as well as compelling new handset designs,
attractive handset features and the increased roll-out in
high-speed data networks, all creating a greater opportunity for
personalization. In this environment, we were able to grow
faster than the market and increase our overall market share.

Industry forecasters predict that the wireless handset industry
will continue to grow over the next several years. Continued
growth will be driven by demand from new subscribers in emerging
markets and replacement sales from a current subscriber base of
over two billion users worldwide.

Our Strategy

The Mobile Devices segment is focused on profitable and
sustainable growth. We believe we can accomplish our strategy by
driving our seamless mobility vision, creating valuable
differentiation of our products through design, and providing
compelling, rich experiences to consumers and carriers.
Motorola’s vision of seamless mobility is to create an
environment where end users are able to interact wirelessly
using a handheld device to realize the experience of a mobile
Internet.

We are differentiating through design by offering the most
compelling products in the six primary form factors in GSM,
CDMA,
iDEN

®

and 3G technologies. Motorola originally invented the clamshell
phone and has reinvented it with the RAZR (V3) and PEBL (U6). We
have also reinvented the candy bar phone with the SLVR (L7) to
show leadership in that category, and the Q will launch in 2006,
reinventing QWERTY-based productivity products.

Our approach to providing rich experiences involves both
partnerships and in-house initiatives. To deliver compelling
experiences to the mobile user in the productivity, imaging and
music segments, we have partnered with Microsoft, Kodak and
Apple, as well as other leaders. Recent announcements with
Yahoo! and Google maintain this momentum by enhancing the
messaging and searching experience. We have already launched
“Screen 3” to enable our carrier customers to offer
rich services such as music and entertainment offerings to
consumers with one-click access.

Underpinning all of these activities is our investment in our
Linux-based platform, which provides cost advantages,
flexibility for carriers, and access to the world’s leading
community of application and software developers.

We are extending our vision with our “Connect the
Unconnected” strategy to bring mobile communications to
underserved markets. This strategy has resulted in two major
contracts with the GSM Association to provide mass-market
handsets to developing regions of the world.



Customers

The Mobile Devices segment customer partnership strategy
continues to focus on strengthening relationships with our top
customers. The segment has several large customers worldwide,
the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse
effect on the segment’s business. In 2005, purchases of
iDEN

®

products by Sprint Nextel Corporation and its affiliates
(“Sprint Nextel”) comprised approximately 11% of
our segment’s net sales.

The largest of our end customers (including sales through
distributors) are Sprint Nextel, Cingular, China Mobile,
América Móvil and T-Mobile. In addition to selling
directly to carriers and operators, Mobile Devices also sells
products through a variety of third-party distributors and
retailers, which account for approximately 36% of the
segment’s net sales. The largest of these distributors,
Brightstar Corporation, is our primary distributor in Latin
America.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
60% of our net sales, are outside the U.S. The largest of these
international markets are China, the United Kingdom, Brazil,
Germany and Mexico. Compared to 2004, the segment experienced
substantial sales growth in all regions of the world as a result
of an improved product portfolio, strong market growth in
emerging markets, and high replacement sales in more mature
markets.

On August 12, 2005, Sprint Corporation and Nextel
Communications, Inc. completed their merger transaction (the
“Sprint Nextel Merger”) that was announced in December
2004. The combined company, Sprint Nextel, is the segment’s
largest customer and Motorola has been its sole supplier of iDEN
handsets and core iDEN network infrastructure equipment for over
ten years. Sprint Nextel uses Motorola’s proprietary iDEN
technology to support its nationwide wireless service business.
Motorola is currently operating under supply agreements for iDEN
handsets and infrastructure equipment that cover the period from
January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The segment
did not experience any significant impact to its business in
2005 as a result of the Sprint Nextel Merger.

Competition

The segment believes it increased its overall market share in
2005 and solidified its hold on the second-largest worldwide
market share of wireless handsets. The segment experiences
intense competition in worldwide markets from numerous global
competitors, including some of the world’s largest
companies. The segment’s primary competitors are European
and Asian manufacturers. Currently, its largest competitors
include Nokia, Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson.

Our strategy of driving our seamless mobility vision, creating
valuable differentiation of our products through design, and
providing compelling, rich experiences (what we call
“mobile me”) to consumers and carriers is intended to
enhance our market position. We also believe that it is critical
to invest in research and development (“R&D”) of
leading technologies and services to remain competitive. In
2005, the segment’s total investment in R&D increased
to support new product development.

General competitive factors in the market for our products
include: time-to-market; brand awareness; technology offered;
price; product performance, features, design, quality, delivery
and warranty; the quality and availability of service; company
image and relationships with key customers.

Payment Terms

The segment’s customers and distributors buy from us
regularly with payment terms that are competitive with current
industry practices. These terms vary globally and range from
cash-with-order to 60 days. Payment terms allow the
customer or distributor to purchase products from us on a
periodic basis and pay for those products at the end of the
agreed term applicable to each purchase. A customer’s
outstanding credit at any point in time is limited to a
predetermined amount as established by management. Extended
payment terms beyond 60 days are provided to customers on a
case-by-case basis. Such extended terms are not related to a
significant portion of our revenues.

Regulatory Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless services. The



growth of the wireless and personal communications industry may
be affected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or,
alternatively, if new technologies are not developed to better
utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use.
Industry growth may also be affected by the cost of the new
licenses required to use frequencies and any related frequency
relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new
wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered
for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network systems,
such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems, such as WiMax.
Other countries have also deregulated portions of the available
spectrum to allow these and other new technologies, which can be
offered without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may
introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
our customers.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $3.0 billion at
December 31, 2005, compared to $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2004. The 2005 backlog is believed to be
generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
recognized as revenue in 2006. The forward-looking estimate of
the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may
cause the amount recognized to change. In 2005, the segment had
strong order growth and backlog increased due to: (i) high
levels of customer demand for new products during the fourth
quarter, certain of which were unable to be shipped in
significant quantities due to supply constraints for select
components, and (ii) the segment’s higher level of
general order input in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to
the fourth quarter of 2004.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing
processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third
parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Motorola is
also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty
and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
subject to licenses. The protection of these licenses is also
important to the segment’s operations. Reference is made to
the material under the heading “Other Information” for
additional information relating to patents and trademarks and
research and development activities with respect to this segment.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
inventory in distribution centers around the world in order to
meet customer delivery requirements in a manner consistent with
industry standards. At the end of 2005, the segment had a
slightly higher inventory balance than at the end of 2004. The
increased inventory was due to select component shortages in the
fourth quarter of 2005 and the need to support higher
anticipated first-quarter 2006 sales compared to the first
quarter of 2005.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
currently source certain materials and components from single
vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Energy necessary for the segment’s manufacturing facilities
consists primarily of electricity and natural gas, which are
currently in generally adequate supply for the segment’s
operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and
freight costs are dependent on world oil prices. A substantial
increase in worldwide oil prices could have a negative impact on
our results of operations. Labor is generally available in
reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing
facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the
aforementioned items could affect the segment’s results.

The segment permits returns under certain circumstances,
generally pursuant to warranties which we consider to be
competitive with current industry practices.

The segment typically experiences increased sales in the fourth
calendar quarter and lower sales in the first calendar quarter
of each year. However, the segment expects less than normal
seasonal sales decline in the first quarter of 2006 due to the
strength of the new product portfolio.



Our Facilities/Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Libertyville, Illinois. Our
major facilities are located in Libertyville, Illinois;
Flensburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; Singapore; Jaguariuna,
Brazil and Malaysia. During the year, we ceased manufacturing
and/or distribution in our facilities in Plantation, Florida and
Seoul, Korea. We also maintain an interest in a joint venture in
Hangzhou, China.

We also use several electronics manufacturing suppliers
(“EMS”) and original design-manufacturers
(“ODM”) to enhance our ability to lower our costs and
deliver products that meet consumer demands in the
rapidly-changing technological environment. On a unit basis,
approximately one-third of our handsets were manufactured
(either completely or substantially) by non-affiliated EMS and
ODM manufacturers.

In 2005, our handsets were primarily manufactured in Asia. We
expect this to continue in 2006. Our largest manufacturing
facilities are located in China, Singapore, Brazil and Malaysia.
Each of these facilities serves multiple countries and regions
of the world. During the year, we stopped manufacturing handsets
in Korea. In addition to our own manufacturing in Asia, the EMS
and ODM manufacturers we utilize primarily manufacture in Asia.

Net sales to our top five customers represented approximately
20% of our total net sales. The loss of one or more of these
customers could have a material adverse effect on the
segment’s business. Net sales to customers in North America
represented 69% of the segment’s net sales.

Competition

Government:

We provide communications and information
systems compliant with both existing industry digital standards,
TETRA and Project 25. We experience widespread competition from
numerous competitors ranging from some of the world’s
largest diversified companies to foreign, state-owned
telecommunications companies to many small, specialized firms.
Many competitors have their principal manufacturing operations
located outside the U.S., which may serve to reduce their
manufacturing costs and enhance their brand recognition in their
locale. Major competitors include: M/

A-Com,

EADS
Telecommunications, Kenwood, EF Johnson and large system
integrators.

We may also act as a subcontractor to a large system integrator
based on a number of competitive factors and customer
requirements. As demand for fully-integrated voice, data and
broadband over wireless systems at the local, state and national
government levels continues, we may face additional competition
from public telecommunications carriers.

Competitive factors for our Government products and systems
include: price; technology offered and standards compliance;
product features, performance, quality and availability; and the
quality and availability of support



services and systems engineering, with no one factor being
dominant. An additional factor is the availability of vendor
financing, as customers continue to look to equipment vendors as
an additional source of financing.

Enterprise:

Demand for enterprise mobility products is
driven by a number of competitors who deliver products in
certain segments of the total Enterprise market. We believe that
we have a unique portfolio to seamlessly connect people, assets
and information to enable customers to grow their business,
increase efficiency and improve customer satisfaction. Security
and manageability are common throughout our portfolio, and we
have the experience and expertise to deliver seamless, secure
and rugged

end-to

-end
solutions to the enterprise. Primary competitors include: Cisco,
Nokia, Symbol and Intermec. Competitive factors for our
Enterprise products and systems include: price; technology
offered and standards compliance; network convergence and
compatibility; product features, performance, quality and
availability; and responsiveness to customers.

Automotive:

Demand for our automotive electronics
products is linked to automobile sales in the United States and
other countries and the level of electronic content per vehicle.
Motorola is a leading provider of automotive electronics
worldwide. Primary competitors in automotive electronics
include: Bosch, Delphi, Visteon, Siemens and Denso. Competitive
factors for our Automotive products and systems include: price;
product quality; performance and delivery; supply integrity;
quality reputation; responsiveness to customers; and design and
manufacturing technology.

Payment Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide. Generally, contract payment terms
range from net 30 to 60 days. As required for competitive
reasons, we may provide or work with

third-party

lenders to
arrange for long-term financing in connection with equipment
purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase
price.

Regulatory Matters

Users of two-way radio communications are regulated by a variety
of governmental and other regulatory agencies throughout the
world. In the U.S., users of two-way radios are licensed by the
FCC, which has broad authority to make rules and regulations and
prescribe restrictions and conditions to carry out the
provisions of the Communications Act of 1934. Regulatory
agencies in other countries have similar types of authority.
Consequently, the business and results of this segment could be
affected by the rules and regulations adopted by the FCC or
regulatory agencies in other countries from time to time.
Motorola has developed products using trunking and data
communications technologies to enhance spectral efficiencies.
The growth and results of the two-way radio communications
industry may be affected by the regulations of the FCC or other
regulatory agencies relating to access to allocated frequencies
for land mobile communications users, especially in urban areas
where such frequencies are heavily used.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network
systems, such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems, such as
Wi4. Other countries have also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow these and other technologies, which
can be offered without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may
introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
our customers.

On February 7, 2005, Sprint Nextel agreed to a plan by
federal regulators designed to address interference from iDEN
phones with hundreds of public safety communications systems in
the U.S. According to the FCC, the agreement should
dramatically reduce the likelihood of interference. Sprint
Nextel will be required to fund certain costs necessary to
relocate those impacted users into the 800MHz spectrum. The
segment will continue to work with our customers that are
impacted by this plan and expects that this will have a neutral
to positive impact on the segment’s business over the next
several years. However, the short-term impact remains uncertain
and is yet to be quantified, as all of the details of the plan
are not finalized.

In February 2006, federal legislation was adopted setting
February 17, 2009 as the date by which key 700MHz spectrum
must be available for first responders throughout the U.S. This
spectrum has historically supported broadcast television. It was
designated for public safety back in 1997, however, prior to
this new legislation, there was no certainty as to when it
actually would be cleared for public safety use in major
markets. Clearing TV from this band will significantly increase
the spectrum public safety entities have available for
communications systems capable of covering their jurisdictions.
This new public safety spectrum is configured to support both
voice and



data. Motorola already has both infrastructure and
mobiles/portables shipping for deployment of public safety voice
and data systems in this band.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $2.4 billion at both
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The 2005
backlog amount is believed to be generally firm, and 75% is
expected to be recognized as revenue during 2006. The
forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is
subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to
change.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is important to the segment’s business.
The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to
its products, technologies and manufacturing processes.
Reference is made to the material under the heading “Other
Information” for information relating to patents and
trademarks and research and development activities with respect
to this segment.

We actively participate in the development of open standards for
interoperable, mission-critical digital two-way radio systems.
We have published our technology and licensed patents to
signatories of the industry’s two primary memorandums of
understanding defined by the Telecommunications Industry
Association (“TIA”) Project 25 and European
Telecommunications Standards Institute
(“ETSI”) Terrestrial Trunked Radio
(“TETRA”). Royalties associated with these licenses
are not expected to be material to the segment’s financial
results.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment provides custom products based on assembling basic
units into a large variety of models or combinations. This
requires the stocking of inventories and large varieties of
piece parts and replacement parts, as well as a variety of basic
level assemblies in order to meet delivery requirements.
Relatively short delivery requirements and historical trends
determine the amounts of inventory to be stocked. To the extent
suppliers’ product life cycles are shorter than the
segment’s, stocking of lifetime buy inventories is
required. In addition, replacement parts are stocked for
delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
currently source certain materials and components from single
vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
primary sources of energy for the segment’s operations,
which are currently in generally adequate supply for the
segment’s operations. In addition, the cost to operate our
facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices.
A substantial increase in worldwide oil prices could have a
negative impact on our results of operations. Labor is generally
available in reasonable proximity to the segment’s
manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any
of these items could affect the segment’s results.

Generally, we do not permit customers to return products. We
typically have stronger sales in the fourth quarter of the year
because of government and commercial spending patterns.

Our headquarters are located in Schaumburg and Deer Park,
Illinois. Our major integration, manufacturing and distribution
facilities are located in: Schaumburg, Illinois; Tianjin, China;
Penang, Malaysia; Berlin and Taunusstein, Germany; Arad, Israel;
Sequin, Texas; Elma, New York; Nogales, Mexico; and Angers,
France. In addition to our own manufacturing, we utilize EMS
manufacturers, primarily in Asia, in order to enhance our
ability to lower our costs and deliver products that meet
consumer demands.

Networks Segment

The Networks segment (“Networks” or the
“segment”) designs, manufactures, sells, installs and
services: (i) cellular infrastructure systems, including
hardware and software,
(ii)

fiber-to

-the-premise
(“FTTP”) and



fiber-to

-the-node
(“FTTN”) transmission systems supporting high-speed
data, video and voice, and (iii) wireless broadband
systems. In addition, the segment designs, manufactures and
sells embedded communications computing platforms. In 2005, the
segment’s net sales represented 17% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

The segment provides

end-to

-end cellular
networks, including radio base stations, base site controllers,
associated software and services, mobility soft switching,
application platforms and third-party switching for CDMA, GSM,
iDEN

®

and UMTS technologies. The segment also provides: optical line
terminals (“OLT”) and optical network terminals
(“ONT”) for passive optical networks
(“PON”); access points, subscriber modules and
backhaul modules for wireless broadband systems; and advanced
TCA and micro TCA communications servers. These products and
services are marketed to wireless and wireline service providers
worldwide through a direct sales force, licensees and agents.

Our Industry

We participate in multiple global markets within the wireline
and wireless segments of the telecommunications industry. Our
primary market is radio access cellular infrastructure systems.
This market grew by approximately 10% in 2005 compared to 2004.
This was the industry’s second year of growth after three
previous years of decline. We expect single digit growth for the
worldwide cellular infrastructure industry in 2006. We also
participate in the emerging PON and wireless broadband systems
markets, which are expected to experience high growth in 2006.

The majority of installed cellular infrastructure systems are
based upon three fundamental technologies: CDMA, GSM and iDEN.
We supply systems based on each of these technologies and are
the sole supplier of proprietary iDEN networks. Advanced
infrastructure systems based on these technologies include:
GPRS, CDMA1X, and EDGE. We also supply systems based on these
technologies.

Some segments of the cellular infrastructure industry are in the
process of migrating to 3G systems, which are high-capacity
radio access wireless networks providing enhanced data services,
improved Internet access and increased voice capacity. The
primary 3G technologies are: W-CDMA (based on either UMTS or
Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (“FOMA”)
technologies) and CDMA2000 1xEVDO. An additional 3G technology
standard is

TD-SCDMA,

driven primarily by the Chinese government and local Chinese
vendors. 3G licenses are expected to be awarded in China during
the second half of 2006. We supply systems based on UMTS and
CDMA2000 1xEVDO technologies. Advanced infrastructure systems
based on 3G technologies include High Speed Downlink Packet
Access (“HSDPA”) and High Speed Uplink Packet Access
(“HSUPA”). We are investing in HSDPA and HSUPA
technologies. Commercial service of 3G technologies was first
introduced in Asia and has expanded to Western Europe and North
America.

Industry standards bodies are in the process of defining the
next-generation of wireless broadband systems after 3G. The
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
(“IEEE”) is currently developing fixed and mobile
broadband standards (802.16d and 802.16e) based on Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (“OFDM technology”),
which offer systems performance utilizing wider channels
enabling triple play services (voice, data, video). Networks
recently announced its MotoWi4 product portfolio that will be
based the 802.16e standard.

A new industry segment of non-traditional wireless broadband
providers has emerged to provide alternative access in targeted
markets. These new providers are using alternative access
technologies such as Metro WiFi with 802.11 standards-based
technology. In addition, alternative broadband providers are
using non-standards based solutions such as Motorola’s
Canopy in licensed and unlicensed spectrum.

The International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) is
also developing next-generation cellular wireless access
standards (“4G”) for the cellular infrastructure
industry, also anticipated to be based upon OFDM technology.

Emerging markets such as China, India, the Middle East, Africa
and Latin America are expected to begin their migration to
next-generation technologies in 2006 and 2007. Because of the
performance offered by OFDM and other alternative technologies,
some emerging markets may forego the deployment of 3G systems
and move directly to other technologies.



Our Strategy

We are executing on a strategy to enable seamless mobility
across multiple access technologies, including cellular, PON and
wireless broadband. The segment continues to invest in the major
cellular radio access technologies: CDMA, GSM,
iDEN

®

,
CDMA2000 1x, GPRS, WiDEN, EDGE, CDMA2000 1x EVDO, UMTS, HSDPA
and HSUPA. Wireline carriers such as Verizon, are expanding
their strategic footprint. We are investing in PON technologies
which will enable these carriers to deliver voice, data and
video over fiber, replacing traditional copper wire connections.

Many cellular operators, particularly in emerging markets, have
not begun their migration to next-generation access
technologies. In addition, wireline operators, such as cable
providers, are looking for new ways to enhance their customer
offering with the addition of a wireless option. Because of its
projected early availability, low cost and superior performance,
wireless broadband technology based on IEEE
standard 802.16e represents a compelling alternative. In
2005, we announced our portfolio of MotoWi4 wireless broadband
products based on this IEEE standard to address this fast
growing market opportunity.

A new industry segment of non-traditional wireless providers has
also emerged. These new providers are using alternative access
technologies such as Metro WiFi which is based on the
IEEE’s 802.11 standard to blanket entire geographic areas
with broadband wireless coverage. Some alternative broadband
providers are also using non-standards based solutions. We
continue to invest in our MotoWi4 Canopy product which enables
low cost, high speed Internet access to customers served by
these providers.

In addition to access, the seamless mobility strategy requires a
converged core network capable of delivering a multiplicity of
applications and services to consumers across multiple access
technologies. This strategy enables consumers to receive these
services seamlessly as they move from one access methodology to
another. The segment will leverage its strong position in
multiple access technologies and cellular Internet protocol
(“IP”) core network capability to deliver
next-generation converged core networks based on IP Multimedia
Subsystem (“IMS”) architectures supporting seamless
mobility.

To facilitate rapid delivery of applications and services to
consumers through the IMS core, Networks has developed the
Global Applications Management Architecture (“GAMA”)
platform providing a standard interface allowing third-party
providers easy integration and deployment of their value-added
services. Examples of these

IP-based

services
include voice over IP (“VoIP”),

Push-to

-Talk,
multi-party gaming, videoconferencing, messaging and content
sharing. Networks has also compiled its own suite of internally,
as well as externally, developed applications which will
complete our

end-to

-end
product offering.

Our network products are further enhanced by a portfolio of
services that reduce operator capital expenditure requirements,
increase network capacity and improve system quality. These
quality improvements benefit operators through increased
customer satisfaction, greater usage and lower churn, all of
which can have a positive impact on operator financial results.

We also continue to build on our industry-leading position in
push-to-talk over cellular (“PoC”) technology. We have
executed agreements to launch our PoC product application on
both GSM and CDMA2000 networks. Networks deployed PoC technology
for 44 wireless carriers in 33 countries and territories in
2005. In addition, Networks has begun executing on its seamless
mobility strategy with major contract wins in PON and wireless
broadband. In 2005, we announced an agreement with Verizon to
supply FTTP access equipment and related services enabling their
triple play offering (voice, data and video). We also signed a
contract with Earthlink to deliver equipment and services
enabling them to become a Metro WiFi broadband provider in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Anaheim, California and other cities.

Customers

Due to the nature of the segment’s business, the agreements
we enter into are primarily long-term contracts with major
operators that require sizeable investments by our customers. In
2005, five customers represented approximately 53% of the
segment’s net sales (Sprint Nextel; KDDI, a service
provider in Japan; China Mobile; Verizon; and China Unicom). The
loss of any of the segment’s large customers, in particular
these customers, could have a material adverse effect on the
segment’s business. Further, because contracts are
long-term, the loss of a major customer would impact revenue and
earnings over several quarters.



Sprint Nextel is our largest customer, representing 23% of
the segment’s net sales in 2005. On August 12, 2005,
Sprint Corporation and Nextel Communications, Inc. completed
their merger transaction (the “Sprint Nextel Merger”)
that was announced in December 2004. The combined company,
Sprint Nextel, is the segment’s largest customer and
Motorola has been its sole supplier of iDEN handsets and core
iDEN network infrastructure equipment for over ten years. Sprint
Nextel uses Motorola’s proprietary iDEN technology to
support its nationwide wireless service business. Motorola is
currently operating under supply agreements for iDEN handsets
and infrastructure equipment that cover the period from
January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The segment
did not experience any significant impact to its business in
2005 as a result of the Sprint Nextel Merger.

Competition

Networks experiences competition in worldwide markets from
numerous competitors, ranging in size from some of the
world’s largest companies to small specialized firms. In
the cellular infrastructure industry, Ericsson is the market
leader, followed by Nokia and four vendors with similar market
share positions, including Motorola, Siemens, Lucent and Nortel.
Alcatel, Samsung and NEC are also significant competitors. We
also experience price competition for both 2G and 3G systems
from Chinese vendors, such as Huawei and ZTE.

Competitive factors in the market for the segment’s
products include: technology offered; price; payment terms;
availability of vendor financing; product and system
performance; product features, quality, delivery, availability
and warranty; the quality and availability of service; company
image; relationship with key customers; and

time-to-market.

Price
is a major area of competition and often impacts margins for
initial system bids, particularly in emerging markets.

Time-to-market

has also
been an important competitive factor, especially for new systems
and technologies.

Payment Terms

The segment’s contracts typically include implementation
milestones, such as delivery, installation and system
acceptance. Generally, these milestones can take anywhere from
30 to 180 days to complete. Customer payments are typically
tied to the completion of these milestones. Once a milestone is
reached, payment terms are generally 30 to 60 days. As
required for competitive reasons, we may arrange or provide for
extended payment terms or long-term financing.

Regulatory Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and
personal communications industry may be affected if adequate
frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new
technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies
currently allocated for such use. Industry growth may also be
affected by the cost of the new licenses required to use
frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network
systems, such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems, such as
Wi4. Other countries have also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow for new technologies, which can be
offered without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may
introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
our customers.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $2.0 billion at both
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The 2005
order backlog is believed to be generally firm and 100% of that
amount is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2006. The
forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is
subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to
change.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
relating to its products, systems, technologies and
manufacturing processes. The segment licenses certain



of its patents to third parties and generates modest revenue
from these licenses. Motorola is also licensed to use certain
patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from
year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and
sales volumes of the products subject to licenses. Reference is
made to the material under the heading “Other
Information” for information relating to patents and
trademarks and research and development activities with respect
to this segment.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a
manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2005,
the segment had a slightly higher inventory balance as compared
to the end of 2004, primarily as result of growth in its
Wireline Networks and Embedded Communications Computing
businesses.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
currently source certain materials and components from single
vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are
primary sources of energy for the segment’s operations,
which are currently in generally adequate supply for the
segment’s operations. In addition, the cost to operate our
facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices.
A substantial increase in worldwide oil prices could have a
negative impact on our results of operations. Labor is generally
available in reasonable proximity to the segment’s
manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any
of these items could affect the segment’s results.

Generally the segment’s contracts do not include a right of
return other than for standard warranty provisions. For new
product introductions, we may enter into milestone contracts
wherein if we do not achieve the milestones, the product could
be returned.

The business does not have seasonal patterns for sales.

facilities in Schaumburg, Illinois; Fort Worth, Texas;
Hangzhou and Tianjin, China; Swindon, U.K.; Munich, Germany and
Nogales, Mexico. A majority of our manufacturing is conducted in
China, with nearly 100% of printed circuit board assembly for
the segment performed by third-party manufacturers in China.

Connected Home Solutions Segment

The Connected Home Solutions segment (the “segment”)
designs, manufactures and sells a wide variety of broadband
products, including: (i) digital systems and set-top boxes
for cable television, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video
and broadcast networks, (ii) high speed data products,
including cable modems and cable modem termination systems
(“CMTS”), and IP-based telephony products,
(iii) hybrid fiber coaxial network transmission systems
used by cable television operators, (iv) digital satellite
program distribution systems,
(v)

direct-to

-home
(“DTH”) satellite networks and private networks for
business communications, and (vi) advanced video
communication products. In 2005, the segment’s net sales
represented 8% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

The segment is a leading provider of

end-to

-end networks
used for the delivery of video, voice and data services over
hybrid fiber coaxial networks. Within the home, the segment
provides interactive digital set-top boxes and Internet gateways
that provide access to entertainment and two-way communications
services. Our in-home products support mobility of content
between devices within the home, integrated access to broadcast,
Internet and personal content, and allow access to wireline and
wireless services using integrated devices within the home.



The segment’s broadband networks include products used to
transport programming by broadcasters and programmers, products
used at the cable operator’s and telephone carrier’s
headends (central office) and products used at the cable
operator’s outside transmission plant. These products
include digital encoders, multiplexers, satellite
receivers/transcoders, content encryption and access control
systems, cable modem termination systems (“CMTS”),
amplifiers, taps, passives and optoelectronics.

Our interactive digital set-top boxes for the end
customer’s home enable advanced interactive entertainment
and informational services, including

video-on

-demand
(“VOD”), digital video recording (“DVR”),
Internet access,

e-mail,

e-commerce,

chat rooms,
pay-per view, and decoding and processing of high-definition
television (“HD”). Our interactive digital set-top
boxes also deliver advanced interactive services focused on
digital video broadcast-compliant (“DVB-compliant”)
markets around the world. We also provide digital system control
equipment, encoders, access control equipment and a wide range
of digital satellite receivers. Our digital business (set-top
boxes and video infrastructure equipment) accounted for
approximately 65% of the segment’s revenue in 2005 and is
expected to account for a substantial portion of the
segment’s revenues for the foreseeable future.

Our cable modems deliver high-speed Internet access to
subscribers over cable networks. These products also include
wireless networking devices with high-speed Internet access for
a complete home, small office or

small-to

-medium
enterprise communications system. Our products also include
voice gateways and cable modems with embedded voice gateways to
enable voice communications over IP using broadband networks.

Our products are marketed primarily to cable television
operators, satellite television programmers, telephone carriers
and other communications providers worldwide and are sold
primarily by our skilled sales personnel. We have also expanded
our traditional distribution channels by selling directly to
consumers in a variety of retail markets. Through retail, we
market and sell primarily cable modems, cordless telephones and
advanced digital set-top boxes.

Our Industry

Demand for our products depends primarily on: (i) capital
spending by providers of broadband services for constructing,
rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems, and
(ii) the marketing of advanced communications services by
those providers. The amount of spending by these providers, and
therefore a majority of our sales and profitability, are
affected by a variety of factors, including: (i) general
economic conditions, (ii) the continuing trend of
consolidation within the cable and telecommunications
industries, (iii) the financial condition of cable
television system operators and alternative communications
providers, including their access to financing, (iv) the
rate of digital penetration, (v) technological
developments, (vi) standardization efforts that impact the
deployment of new equipment, and (vii) new legislation and
regulations affecting the equipment sold by the segment. In
2005, our customers increased their spending on our products,
primarily due to the increase in digital video and data
subscribers and the deployment of advanced video platforms by
cable operators for HD/DVR applications.

Our Strategy

Our strategy is to be the global leader in broadband connected
home solutions and services, enabling customers to be seamlessly
informed, connected and entertained. We continue to focus on our
strategy to innovate and enhance our

end-to

-end network
portfolio, provide for convergence of services and applications
across delivery platforms within the home and develop new
services that leverage our platforms. We are focused on
accelerating the rate of digital penetration by broadband
operators in North America through the introduction of an
enhanced suite of digital set-top boxes, including more
cost-effective products designed to increase the number of
set-top boxes per household, as well as higher-end products for
advanced services, including supporting the growing HD and DVR
markets. During 2005, we shipped the first digital

set-top

boxes capable
of supporting integrated exchange of stored content among
devices in a consumer’s home.

We also continue to focus on growing our business in regions
outside of North America, including the development of digital
video products compliant with technology required in these
regions. During 2005, the segment launched digital video in
Chile with VTR, provided interactive digital terrestrial
receivers for use in Italy and provided

end-to-end

equipment to
support the launch of the first digital cable system in Hungary.
We have also expanded our relationship with Cablevision in
Mexico, adding DVRs to their service portfolio.



The segment is capitalizing upon the introduction of video
services by telecommunication operators to their subscribers
(“Telco TV” or “IPTV”) with products that
support delivery of video content using both
copper-outside-plant and
fiber

-to-the

-premises
networks. During the year, the segment provided

end-to-end

equipment
for the launch of Verizon’s FiOS service and won a contract
to supply advanced IP interactive

set-top

boxes to
AT&T.

We are focused on enhancing and expanding our voice and data
offerings to offer

end-to

-end solutions
for

fixed-mobile

convergence and next-generation converged IP based voice,
data and video delivery. These solutions include:
(i) stand-alone and integrated voice/data/WiFi gateways
with support for handing off a mobile voice or data call to a
WiFi access point and a carrier’s VoIP network, and
(ii) next-generation infrastructure products in the CMTS
and fiber optic network markets which expand the bandwidth
delivered to a home or business. Sales of our CMTS
infrastructure products increased over 20% in 2005 as cable
operators built out their networks to accommodate
high-availability VoIP, higher speed data offerings and
multimedia applications such as streaming video and music as
well as interactive gaming. Our voice gateway business
experienced significant growth in 2005 as cable television
operators, as well as non-facilities based VoIP service
providers, aggressively launched and expanded their services. We
expect this trend to continue in 2006 as the rich capabilities
and value of these services result in continued adoption by
mainstream consumers.

Customers

The vast majority of our sales are in the U.S., where a small
number of large cable television multiple system operators
(“MSOs”) own a large portion of the cable systems and
account for a significant portion of the total capital spending
in the industry. We are dependent upon a small number of
customers for a significant portion of our sales. Comcast
Corporation accounted for approximately 31% of the
segment’s net sales in 2005. The loss of business in the
future from Comcast or any of the other major MSOs could have a
material adverse effect on the segment’s business. Sales of
video headend equipment and set-top boxes to telephone carriers
accounted for approximately 5% of our revenue in 2005. The
opportunity in this market segment is expected to continue to
grow as carriers around the world expand to offer video services.

Competition

The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. The
rapid technological changes occurring in each of the markets in
which we compete are expected to lead to the entry of many new
competitors.

We compete worldwide in the market for digital set-top boxes for
broadband and satellite networks. Based on 2005 annual sales, we
believe we are the leading provider of digital cable set-top
boxes in North America. Our digital cable set-top boxes compete
with products from a number of different companies, including:
(i) those that develop and sell substitute products that
are distributed by direct broadcast satellite
(“DBS”) service providers through retail
channels, (ii) those that develop, manufacture and sell
products of their own design, and (iii) those that license
technology from us or other competitors. In North America, our
largest competitor is Scientific-Atlanta. Other competitors in
North America include Cisco, ARRIS and C-COR. Outside of North
America, where we have a smaller market position, we compete
with many equipment suppliers, including several consumer
electronics companies. Cisco, a major competitor to the
segment’s IP products, home gateways and systems, announced
that it will acquire Scientific-Atlanta, our largest competitor
in conventional hybrid fiber coaxial cable technology. This
combination strengthens Cisco, enabling it to offer end-to-end
solutions in both hybrid fiber coaxial cable and IP networks,
and encompasses a broad set of customer relationships around the
world.

The traditional competitive environment in the North American
cable market continues to change for several reasons. Based on
our customers’ requirements, we have begun and will
continue to license certain of our technology to certain
competitors. In 2005, we formed a joint venture with Comcast
Corporation. This joint venture licenses certain of our
technologies to competitors to build set-top boxes and elements
of headend equipment. Comcast and other network operators can
then purchase these products from these licensees.

Historically, reception of digital television programming from
the cable broadband network required a set-top box with security
technology that was compatible with the network. This security
technology has limited the availability of set-top boxes to
those manufactured by a few cable network manufacturers,
including Motorola. The FCC has enacted regulations requiring
separation of security functionality from set-top boxes by
July 1, 2007. To meet this requirement, we have developed
security modules for sale to cable operators for use with our
own and third-party set-top boxes. As a step towards this
implementation, in 2002, the cable industry and consumer
electronic manufacturers agreed to a uni-directional security
interface that allows third-party devices to access



broadcast programming (not pay-per-view or VOD) with a security
device. These devices became widely available in 2004 and to
date have seen limited use. The limited use of the devices has
not had a significant impact on our business. A full two-way
security interface specification is in development, and
compliant devices are likely to be available in late 2006. These
changes are expected to increase competition and encourage the
sale of set-top boxes to consumers in the retail market.
Traditionally, cable service providers have leased the set-top
box to their customers. These changes could adversely impact our
competitive position and our sales and profitability. Most of
our sales and profits arise from the sale of our set-top boxes.

We also compete worldwide in the market for broadband data and
voice products. We believe that we are the leading provider of
cable modems worldwide, competing with a number of consumer
electronic companies and various original design manufacturers
worldwide.

Competitive factors for our products and systems include:
technology offered; product and system performance, features,
quality, delivery and availability; and price. We believe that
we enjoy a strong competitive position because of our large
installed cable television equipment base, strong relationships
with major communication system operators worldwide,
technological leadership and new product development
capabilities.

Payment Terms

Generally, our payment terms are consistent with the industry
and range from 30 to 60 days. Extended payment terms are
provided to customers from time to time on a case-by-case basis.
Such extended terms are isolated in nature and historically have
not related to a significant portion of our revenues.

Regulatory Matters

Many of our products are subject to regulation by the FCC or
other communications regulatory agencies. In addition, our
customers and their networks, into which our products are
incorporated, are subject to government regulation. Government
regulatory policies affecting either the willingness or the
ability of cable operators and telephone carriers to offer
certain services, or the terms on which the companies offer the
services and conduct their business, may affect the
segment’s results. Regulatory actions also have impacted
competition, as discussed above.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $424 million at
December 31, 2005, compared to $304 million at
December 31, 2004. The increase in backlog and related
orders primarily reflects increased orders from our customers
for advanced set-top boxes. The 2005 order backlog is believed
to be generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
recognized as revenue in 2006. The forward-looking estimates of
the firmness of such orders is subject to future events, which
may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

We seek to build upon our core enabling technologies, such as
digital compression, encryption and conditional access systems,
in order to lead worldwide growth in the market for broadband
communications networks. Our policy is to protect our
proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and
foreign patent applications to protect technology and
improvements that we consider important to the development of
our business. We also rely on our proprietary knowledge and
ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our
competitive position, and will periodically seek to include our
proprietary technologies in certain patent pools that support
the implementation of standards. We are a founder of MPEG LA,
the patent licensing authority established to foster broad
deployment of MPEG-2 compliant systems. We have also licensed
our digital conditional access technology,
DigiCipher

®

II,
to other equipment suppliers and have formed joint ventures with
Comcast Corporation for development and licensing of conditional
access technology. We also enter into other license agreements,
both as licensor and licensee, covering certain products and
processes with various companies. These license agreements
require the payment of certain royalties that are not expected
to be material to the segment’s financial results.



Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

Substantially all of our products are manufactured at our
facilities in Taipei, Taiwan and Nogales, Mexico. Inventory
levels are managed in line with existing business conditions.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
currently source certain materials and components from single
vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Electricity is the primary source of energy required for our
manufacturing operations, which is currently in generally
adequate supply for the segments operations. In addition, the
cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent
on world oil prices. A substantial increase in world-wide oil
prices could have a negative impact on our results of
operations. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity
to the segment’s manufacturing facilities. However,
difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned terms could
affect the segments results.

Generally, we do not permit customers to return products. We
have not experienced seasonal buying patterns for our products
recently. However, as our retail cable modem and digital set-top
box sales increase, we may have increased sales during the
holiday season at the end of each year.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. We also
have research and development and administrative offices in
San Diego, San Jose and Sunnyvale, California;
Lexington and Marlboro, Massachusetts; and Lawrenceville,
Georgia. We have several sales offices throughout North America,
Europe, Latin America and Asia, and we operate manufacturing
facilities in Taipei, Taiwan and Nogales, Mexico. We also use
contract manufacturers with plants in China for a portion of our
cable modem/voice module production in order to enhance our
ability to lower our costs and deliver products that meet
consumer demand.

Other Information

2005 Change in Organizational Structure.

Effective on
January 1, 2005, the Company reorganized its businesses and
functions to align with the Company’s seamless mobility
strategy. The Company was organized into four main business
groups, focused on mobile devices, government and enterprise,
networks and the connected home. The Mobile Devices business is
primarily comprised of the former Personal Communications
segment and the Energy Systems group from the former Integrated
Electronic Systems segment (“IESS”). The Government
and Enterprise Mobility Solutions business is primarily
comprised of the former Commercial, Government and Industrial
Solutions segment and the Automotive Communications and
Electronics Systems group from the former IESS. The Networks
business is primarily comprised of the former Global Telecom
Solutions segment, the Embedded Computing and Communications
group from the former IESS, and the next-generation wireline
networks business from the former Broadband Communications
segment (“BCS”). The Connected Home Solutions business
is primarily comprised of the former BCS, excluding the
next-generation wireline networks business. In addition, the
Company’s key support functions, including supply-chain
operations, information technology, finance, human resources,
legal, strategy and business development, marketing, quality and
technology have been architected centrally and distributed
throughout the Company.

Financial Information About Segments.

The response to
this section of Item 1 incorporates by reference
Note 10, “Information by Segment and Geographic
Region,” of Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data of this document.

Customers.

Motorola has several large customers, the loss
of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on
the Company. Motorola’s largest end customers (including
sales through distributors) are Sprint Nextel, Cingular, China
Mobile, América Móvil and

T-Mobile.

Motorola sold
approximately 12% of its products and services to Sprint Nextel
in 2005.

Approximately 2% of Motorola’s net sales in 2005 were to
various branches and agencies, including the armed services, of
the U.S. Government. All contracts with the
U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the
convenience of the Government.



Government contractors, including Motorola, are routinely
subjected to numerous audits and investigations, which may be
either civil or criminal in nature. The consequences of these
audits and investigations may include administrative action to
suspend business dealings with the contractor and to exclude it
from receiving new business. In addition, Motorola, like other
contractors, reviews aspects of its government contracting
operations, and, where appropriate, takes corrective actions and
makes voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Government. These
audits and investigations could adversely affect Motorola’s
ability to obtain new business from the U.S. Government.

Backlog.

Motorola’s aggregate backlog position for
all Motorola segments, as of the end of the last two fiscal
years was approximately as follows:

December 31, 2005

$7.8 billion

December 31, 2004

$6.3 billion

Except as previously discussed in this Item 1, the orders
supporting the 2005 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table
are believed to be generally firm, and approximately 92% of the
backlog on hand at December 31, 2005 is expected to be
shipped or earned, with respect to contracts accounted for under
the percentage of completion or completed contract accounting,
during 2006. However, this is a forward-looking estimate of the
amount expected to be shipped or earned, and future events may
cause the percentage actually shipped or earned to change.

Research and Development.

Motorola’s business
segments participate in very competitive industries with
constant changes in technology. Throughout its history, Motorola
has relied, and continues to rely, primarily on its research and
development (“R&D”) programs for the development
of new products, and on its production engineering capabilities
for the improvement of existing products. Technical data and
product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola’s
business segments on a regular basis. Management believes,
looking forward, that Motorola’s commitment to R&D
programs, both to improve existing products and services and to
develop new products and services, together with its utilization
of

state-of

-the-art
technology, should allow each of its segments to remain
competitive.

R&D expenditures relating to new product development or
product improvement were approximately $3.7 billion in
2005, compared to $3.4 billion in 2004 and
$3.0 billion in 2003. R&D expenditures increased 8% in
2005 as compared to 2004, after increasing 15% in 2004 as
compared to 2003. Motorola continues to believe that a strong
commitment to research and development is required to drive
long-term growth. Approximately 25,000 professional employees
were engaged in such research activities during 2005.

Patents and Trademarks.

Motorola seeks to obtain patents
and trademarks to protect our proprietary position whenever
possible and practical. As of December 31, 2005, Motorola
owned 8,557 utility and design patents in the U.S. and
12,801 patents in foreign countries. These foreign patents
are mostly counterparts of Motorola’s U.S. patents,
but a number result from research conducted outside the U.S. and
are originally filed in the country of origin. During 2005,
Motorola was granted 548 U.S. utility and design
patents. Many of the patents owned by Motorola are used in its
operations or licensed for use by others, and Motorola is
licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and
licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
subject to licenses.

Environmental Quality.

Compliance with federal, state and
local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment, has no material effect on capital expenditures,
earnings or the competitive position of Motorola.

Employees.

At December 31, 2005, there were
approximately 69,000 employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries,
as compared to approximately 68,000 employees at
December 31, 2004.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations
and Export Sales.

Domestic export sales to third parties
were $2.1 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Domestic export sales to affiliates and
subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation, were
$2.6 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

We wish to caution the reader that the following important
risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this
report or our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document
and elsewhere.

The demand for our products depends in large part on the
continued growth of the industries in which we participate. A
market decline in any one of these industries could have an
adverse effect on our business.

In 2004 and 2005, the portions of the telecommunications
industry in which we participate have returned to double digit
growth. However, our business was very negatively impacted by
the economic slowdown and the corresponding reduction in capital
spending by the telecommunications industry from 2001 to 2003.
The rate at which the portions of the telecommunications
industry in which we participate continue to grow is critical to
our ability to improve our overall financial performance.

Our customers are located throughout the world and, as a
result, we face risks that other companies that are not global
may not face.

Our customers are located throughout the world and more than
half of our net sales are made to customers outside of the
U.S. In addition, we have many manufacturing,
administrative and sales facilities outside the U.S., the
majority of our products are manufactured outside the U.S. and
more than half of our employees are employed outside the U.S.

As with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations
outside the U.S., we are exposed to risks that could negatively
impact sales or profitability, including but not limited to:
(1) tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes;
(2) regulations related to customs and import/export
matters; (3) longer payment cycles; (4) tax issues,
such as tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to
country and as compared to the U.S., and difficulties in
repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient
manner; (5) currency fluctuations, particularly in the
euro, Chinese renminbi and Brazilian real; (6) challenges
in collecting accounts receivable; (7) cultural and
language differences; (8) employment regulations and local
labor conditions; (9) difficulties protecting IP in foreign
countries; (10) instability in economic or political
conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or
anticipated military or political conflicts; (11) natural
disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons;
(12) public health issues or outbreaks; and (13) the
impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and
procurement arrangements.

Many of our products that are manufactured outside of the
U.S. are manufactured in Asia. In particular, we have
sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing
operations, and 8% of our net sales are made to customers in
China. The legal system in China is still developing and is
subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for
products in China could be adversely impacted by changes to or
interpretation of Chinese law. Further, if manufacturing in the
region is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly
reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted.

If the quality of our products does not meet our
customers’ expectations, then our sales and operating
earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be adversely
affected.

Occasionally, some of the products we sell have quality issues
resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from
the software used in the product. Often these issues are
identified prior to the shipment of the products and may cause
delays in shipping products to customers, or even the
cancellation of orders by customers. Sometimes, we discover
quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to
our distributors or end-user customers, requiring us to resolve
such issues in a timely manner that is the least disruptive to
our customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment quality
issues can have legal and financial ramifications, including:
delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future
orders, customer-imposed penalties on Motorola for failure to
meet contractual shipment deadlines, increased costs associated
with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on
our goodwill and brand name reputation.

In some cases, if the quality issue affects the product’s
safety or regulatory compliance, then such a
“defective” product may need to be recalled. Depending
on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the
field, it can cause the Company to incur substantial recall
costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential
loss



of future orders, and the damage to the Company’s goodwill
or brand/reputation. In addition, the Company may be required,
under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for failed
performance that might exceed the revenue that the Company
receives from the contracts. Recalls involving regulatory
agencies can also result in fines and additional costs. Finally,
recalls can result in third-party litigation, including class
action litigation by persons alleging common harm resulting from
the purchase of the products.

We operate in highly-competitive markets and our financial
results will be affected if we are not able to compete
effectively.

The markets for our products are highly competitive with respect
to, among other factors: pricing, product and service quality,
and the time required to introduce new products and services. We
are constantly exposed to the risk that our competitors may
implement new technologies before we do, or may offer lower
prices, additional products or services or other incentives that
we cannot or will not offer. We can give no assurances that we
will be able to compete successfully against existing or future
competitors.

The uncertainty of current economic and political conditions
makes budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce demand
for our products.

Current conditions in the domestic and global economies are
uncertain. The U.S. involvement in Iraq and other global
conflicts, including in the Middle East, as well as public
health issues, have created many economic and political
uncertainties that have impacted the global economy. As a
result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the
world economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate
growth in various parts of the world economy, including the
markets in which we participate. Because all components of our
budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth
in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the
prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future
income and expenditures difficult.

The future direction of the overall domestic and global
economies will have a significant impact on our overall
performance. The potential for future terrorist attacks,
increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing
conflicts and public health issues has created worldwide
uncertainties that have negatively impacted, and may continue to
negatively impact, demand for certain of our products.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to
purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components
to meet the demands of our customers.

Our ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on
our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality
materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We have
experienced shortages in the past that have adversely affected
our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to
avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurances that
we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore,
certain of our components are available only from a single
source or limited sources. We may not be able to diversify
sources in a timely manner. A reduction or interruption in
supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies
could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

Our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new
products and technologies and our results can be impacted by our
significant investments in new products and technologies.

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly
changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, short
product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Our success
depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful
introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to
comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing
technological and product developments carried out by our
competitors. The research and development of new,
technologically-advanced products is a complex and uncertain
process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the
accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may
focus our resources on technologies that do not become widely
accepted and are not commercially viable. In addition, products
may contain defects or errors that are detected only after
deployment. If our products are not competitive or do not work
properly, our business will suffer.

Our results are subject to risks related to our significant
investment in developing and introducing new products, such as:
seamless mobility products, advanced digital wireless handsets;
CDMA2000 1X, UMTS and other advanced technologies for wireless
networks; products for transmission of telephony and high-speed
data over



hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems; integrated digital radios;
and integrated public safety systems. These risks include:
(i) difficulties and delays in the development, production,
testing and marketing of products; (ii) customer acceptance
of products; (iii) the development of industry standards;
(iv) the significant amount of resources we must devote to
the development of new technology; and (v) the ability to
differentiate our products and compete with other companies in
the same markets.

Our success, in part, will be affected by the ability of our
wireless businesses to successfully compete in the ever-evolving
markets in which we participate. We face intense competition in
these markets from both established companies and new entrants.
Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive
to develop and bring to market.

Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form
successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not
develop as expected, our business may be adversely impacted.

We currently partner with industry leaders to meet customer
product and service requirements and to develop innovative
advances in design and technology. Some of our partnerships
allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share
the cost of developing next-generation technologies. Other
partnerships allow us to offer more services and features to our
customers. If such arrangements do not develop as expected, our
business could be adversely impacted.

Our business will be harmed if we are found to have infringed
intellectual property rights of third parties, or if our
intellectual property protection is inadequate to protect our
proprietary rights.

Because our products are comprised of complex technology, we are
involved in litigation regarding patent and other intellectual
property rights. Third parties have asserted, and in the future
may assert, claims against us alleging that we have infringed
their intellectual property rights. If we do not succeed in any
such litigation, we could be required to expend significant
resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual
property or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that
is the subject of such litigation. However, we cannot be certain
that any such licenses, if available at all, will be available
to us on commercially reasonable terms. Also, defending these
claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our
management and employees.

Our patent and other intellectual property rights are important
competitive tools and may generate income under license
agreements. We regard our intellectual property rights as
proprietary and attempt to protect them with patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality
agreements and other methods. We also generally restrict access
to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite
these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to
obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar
technology independently. In addition, effective patent,
copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be
unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third
parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our
intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our
business.

Many of our components and products are manufactured by third
parties and if third-party manufacturers lack sufficient quality
control or if there are significant changes in the financial or
business condition of such third-party manufacturers, it may
have a material adverse effect on our business.

We rely on third-party suppliers for many of the components used
in our products and we rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products. If
such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there
are significant changes in the financial or business condition
of such third parties, it could have a material adverse effect
on our business.

We also have third-party arrangements for the design or
manufacture of certain products, parts and components. If these
third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts and
components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have
difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits
could decline.

There is no guarantee that design wins will become actual
orders and sales.

A “design win” occurs when a customer or prospective
customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be
integrated with the customer’s product. There can be delays
of several months or more between the design win and when a
customer initiates actual orders. The design win may never
become an actual order or sale.



Further, if the customer’s plans change, we may commit
significant resources to design wins that do not result in
actual orders.

We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions.
Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such
actions on our business may be limited by a variety of factors.
The cost reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional
production risk and have an adverse effect on our sales and
profitability.

We have been reducing costs and simplifying our product
portfolios in all of our businesses. We have discontinued
product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing
operations and reduced our employee population.

The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and
profitability may be influenced by factors including, but not
limited to: (1) our ability to successfully complete these
ongoing efforts; (2) our ability to generate the level of
cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to
effectively compete; (3) delays in implementation of
anticipated workforce reductions in highly-regulated locations
outside of the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia;
(4) decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet
operational targets due to the loss of employees, particularly
sales employees; (5) our ability to retain or recruit key
employees; (6) the appropriateness of the size of our
manufacturing capacity, including capacity from third parties;
and (7) the performance of other parties under contract
manufacturing arrangements on which we rely for the manufacture
of certain products, parts and components.

An important cost-reduction action has been to reduce the number
of our facilities, including manufacturing facilities. All of
our businesses have exited certain facilities or consolidated
facilities so that our products are manufactured in fewer
facilities. While we have business continuity and risk
management plans in place in case capacity is significantly
reduced or eliminated at a given facility, the reduced number of
alternative facilities could cause the period of any
manufacturing disruptions to be longer. As a result, we could
have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and
profits could decline.

We may not continue to have access to the capital markets to
obtain long-term and short-term financing on acceptable terms
and conditions, particularly if our credit ratings are
downgraded.

From time to time we access the long-term and short-term capital
markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that we can
continue to access the capital markets in 2006 on acceptable
terms and conditions, our access and the availability of
acceptable terms and conditions are impacted by many factors,
including: (i) our credit ratings, (ii) the liquidity
of the overall capital markets, and (iii) the current state
of the economy, including the telecommunications industry. There
can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to the
capital markets on terms acceptable to the Company.

Our credit ratings have been upgraded by each of the
3 major credit rating agencies during the last year.
However, if our rating by Moody’s Investor Service
(“Moody’s”) were to decline two levels from the
current rating, we would no longer be considered investment
grade by Moody’s. As a result, our financial flexibility
would be reduced and our cost of borrowing would increase. Some
of the factors that impact our credit ratings, including the
overall economic health of the telecommunications industry, are
outside of our control. There can be no assurances that our
current credit ratings will continue.

Our commercial paper is rated “A-2/ P-2/ F-2.” Given
the smaller size of the market for commercial paper rated
“A-2/ P-2/ F-2” and the number of large commercial
paper issuers in this market, commercial paper or other
short-term borrowings may be unavailable or of limited
availability to participants in this market. Although we
continue to issue commercial paper, there can be no assurances
that we will continue to have access to the commercial paper
markets on terms acceptable to the Company.

We may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility
if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing in our
facility.

We view our existing three-year revolving domestic credit
facility as a source of available liquidity. This facility
contains various conditions, covenants and representations with
which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We have
never borrowed under this facility. However, if we wish to
borrow under this facility in the



future, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance
with these conditions, covenants and representations.

We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use
under certain circumstances.

If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable
income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant
change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period
within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable
or deductible, the Company could be required to increase its
valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting
in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact
on future operating results.

We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other
companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce
significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to
integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from
the acquisitions.

In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth
opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the difficulty
in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an
efficient and effective manner; (2) the challenges in
achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits
from acquisitions; (3) the risk that our markets do not
evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not
prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;
(4) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired
businesses; (5) the risk of diverting the attention of
senior management from our operations; (6) the risks of
entering new markets in which we have limited experience;
(7) risks associated with integrating financial reporting
and internal control systems; (8) difficulties in expanding
information technology systems and other business processes to
accommodate the acquired businesses; and (9) future
impairments of goodwill of an acquired business.

Acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate
may carry higher relative valuations (based on their earnings)
than we do. This is particularly evident in software and
services businesses. Acquiring a business that has a higher
valuation than Motorola may be dilutive to our earnings,
especially when the acquired business has little or no revenue.
In addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly
dilutive to near-term earnings and have, in the past, foregone
certain of these acquisitions.

Key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial
value in connection with a transaction in the form of

change-in

-control
agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of
restrictions on other equity-based compensation rights. To
retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we
may offer additional, sometimes costly, retention incentives.

As a supplier to the automotive industry, we face certain
risks due to the nature of the automotive business.

As a supplier of automotive electronics and telematics
communication products, our sales of these products and our
profitability could be negatively impacted by changes in the
operations, products, business models, part-sourcing
requirements, financial condition, market share or consumer
financing and rebate programs of our automotive customers. In
addition, demand for our automotive products is linked to
consumer demand for automobiles, which may be adversely impacted
by the continuing uncertain economic environment.

The value of our investments in the securities of various
companies fluctuates and it may be difficult for us to realize
the value of these investments.

We hold a portfolio of investments in various companies. Since
the majority of these securities represent investments in
technology companies, the fair market values of these securities
are subject to significant price volatility. In addition, the
realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
other conditions.

We also have invested in numerous privately-held companies, many
of which can still be considered in startup or developmental
stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for
the technologies or products they have under development are
typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
could lose all or substantially all of our investments in these
companies, and in some cases have.



It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of
highly-skilled employees that are necessary to remain
competitive.

Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology
industries is intense. We believe that our future success
depends in large part on our continued ability to hire,
assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified
engineers and other highly-skilled personnel needed to compete
and develop successful new products. We may not be as successful
as our competitors at recruiting, assimilating, retaining and
utilizing these highly-skilled personnel.

The unfavorable outcome of litigation pending against or
future litigation could materially impact the Company.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation. See
“Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.” There can
be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation.

We are subject to a wide range of environmental, health and
safety laws.

Our operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are
subject to a wide range of global environmental, health and
safety laws. Compliance with existing or future environmental,
health and safety laws could subject us to future costs,
liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our
ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities and generally
impact our financial performance.

Some of these laws relate to the use, disposal, clean up of, and
exposure to hazardous substances. In the United States, laws
often require parties to fund remedial studies or action
regardless of fault. Motorola continues to incur disposal cost
and has ongoing remediation obligations. Changes to U.S.
environmental laws or our discovery of additional obligations
under these laws could have a negative impact on Motorola.

Over the last several years, the European Union (the
“EU”) countries have enacted environmental laws
regulating electronic products. Our products are impacted by
laws that mandate the recycling of waste in electronic products
sold in the EU and that will limit or prohibit the use of
certain substances in electronic products beginning July 1,
2006. Other countries outside of Europe are expected to adopt
similar laws. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur
additional expenses to comply with these laws.

We may provide financing and financial guarantees to our
customers, some of which may be for significant amounts.

The competitive environment in which we operate may require us
to provide

long-term

customer financing to a customer in order to win a contract.
Customer financing arrangements may include all or a portion of
the purchase price for our products and services, as well as
working capital. In some circumstances, these loans can be very
large. We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from
banks and other sources and may also provide financial
guarantees on behalf of our customers. Our success, particularly
in our infrastructure businesses, may be dependent, in part,
upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive
terms and on our customers’ creditworthiness.

We also provide revolving, short-term financing to certain
customers and distributors that purchase our equipment. Our
success may be dependent, in part, on our ability to provide
this financing. Our financial results could be negatively
impacted if our customers or distributors fail to repay this
revolving, short-term debt and/or our sales to such customers or
distributors could be reduced in the event of real or perceived
issues about the credit quality of the customer or distributor.

When we lend our customers money in connection with the sale
of our equipment, we are at risk of not being repaid.

While we have generally been able to place a portion of our
customer financings with third-party lenders, a portion of these
financings are supported directly by us. There can be higher
risks of default associated with some of these financings,
particularly when provided to

start-up

operations
such as local network providers, customers in developing
countries, or customers in specific financing-intensive areas of
the industry (such as 3G wireless operators). Should customers
fail to meet their obligations on new or existing loans, losses
could be incurred and such losses could negatively impact our
financial results.



Our large system contracts for infrastructure equipment and
the resulting reliance on large customers may negatively impact
our business.

We are exposed to risks due to large system contracts for
infrastructure equipment and the resulting reliance on large
customers. These include: (1) the technological risks of
such contracts, especially when the contracts involve new
technology, and (2) financial risks under these contracts,
including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated
with large contracts and the related impact on operating
results. We are also facing increasing competition from
traditional system integrators and the defense industry as
system contracts become larger and more complicated. Political
developments can impact the nature and timing of these large
contracts.

It is important that we are able to obtain many different
types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance
we are forced to retain the risk.

The Company has many types of insurance coverage and also

self-insures

for some
risks and obligations. Generally, costs and availability of
insurance has improved recently since the disruption to the
market after the events of September 11, 2001. However,
there are still certain types or levels of insurance that remain
unavailable. Natural disasters (hurricanes, windstorms,
earthquakes and floods) and certain risks arising from
securities claims and public liability are potential

self-insured

events
that could negatively impact our financial performance.

Government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the
growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce
barriers to entry for new competitors.

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and
personal communications industry may be affected if adequate
frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new
technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies
currently allocated for such use. Industry growth has been and
may continue to be affected by the cost of new licenses required
to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include Wireless Local Area Network
systems such as WiFi, and Wide Area Network systems such as
WiMax. Other countries have also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow these and other technologies, which
can be offered without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may
introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
our customers.

Changes in government policies and laws or economic
conditions may adversely affect our financial results.

Our results may be affected by changes in trade, monetary and
fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of
U.S. and

non-U.S.

governments,
agencies and similar organizations. Our results may also be
affected by social and economic conditions, which impact our
operations, including in emerging markets in Asia and Latin
America and in markets subject to ongoing political hostilities
and war, including the Middle East.

In addition, there are currently few laws or regulations that
apply directly to access to, or commerce on, the Internet. We
could be adversely affected by any such regulation in any
country where we operate. The adoption of such measures could
decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase
the cost of selling such products.

Consolidations in both the cable and telecommunication
industries may adversely impact our business.

The cable and telecommunication industries have experienced
consolidation, and this trend is expected to continue according
to industry estimates. Industry consolidation could result in
delays of purchases by the merged companies to equipment
suppliers such as Motorola and our competitors.

Because of continuing consolidation within the cable industry
worldwide, a small number of operators own a majority of cable
television systems and account for a significant portion of the
capital spending made by cable television system operators. Net
sales to the Connected Home Solutions segment’s largest
customer, Comcast, which merged with AT&T Broadband in 2002,
represented approximately 31% of the Connected Home Solutions
segment’s total net sales in 2005.



Sprint Nextel is our largest customer, representing 12% of
the Company’s net sales in 2005. On August 12, 2005,
Sprint Corporation and Nextel Communications, Inc. completed
their merger transaction that was announced in December 2004.
The combined company, Sprint Nextel, is the segment’s
largest customer and Motorola has been its sole supplier of
iDEN

®

handsets and core iDEN network infrastructure equipment for over
ten years.

Fewer significant customers will increase our reliance on large
customers and may negatively impact our bargaining position and
profit margins. The loss of, or a lesser role with, a
significant customer due to industry consolidation may
negatively impact our business.

Regulatory changes impacting our cable products may adversely
impact our business.

Currently, reception of digital television programming from the
cable broadband network requires a set-top box with certain
technology. This security technology has limited the
availability of set-top boxes to those manufactured by a few
cable network manufacturers, including Motorola. The FCC enacted
regulations requiring separation of security functionality from
set-top boxes to increase competition and encourage the sale of
set-top boxes in the retail market. Traditionally, cable service
providers sold or leased the set-top box to their customer. As
the retail market develops for set-top boxes and televisions
capable of accepting the security modules, sales of our set-top
boxes may be negatively impacted.

The FCC has mandated that digital tuners to enable access to
cable networks be incorporated into most television sets by
2007. Such televisions can access certain cable programming
without a digital

set-top

box. As a
result, future sales of set-top boxes may be negatively impacted.

We rely on complex information technology systems and
networks to operate our business. Any significant system or
network disruption could have a material adverse impact on our
operations, sales and operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex
information technology systems and networks. All information
technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or
interruption from a variety of sources, including but not
limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts,
natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new
or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not
installed properly. We have implemented various measures to
manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but
a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our
operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur
additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these
disruptions or security breaches.

Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.

Our share price has been volatile due, in part, to generally
volatile securities markets, and the volatility in the
telecommunications and technology companies’ securities
markets in particular. Factors other than our financial results
that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to,
market expectations of our performance, capital spending plans
of our customers, and the level of perceived growth in the
industries in which we participate.

We rely on third-party distributors and retailers to sell
certain of our products.

In addition to our own distribution force, we offer our products
through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers.
Certain of our distributors market products that compete with
the Company’s products. The loss, termination or failure of
one or more of our distributors to effectively promote our
products could affect the Company’s ability to bring its
products to market. Changes in the financial or business
condition of these distributors and retailers could also subject
the Company to losses.

The level of returns on pension and retirement plan assets
could affect our earnings in future periods.

The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by
the performance of the financial markets, particularly the
equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are
determined under ERISA and are measured each year based on the
value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the
financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are
expected under the ERISA funding calculation, we could be
required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can
be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our
estimate of future contribution requirements can change
dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly,
changes in interest rates can impact our contribution
requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood
of required contributions in the future increases.



Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance
and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.

Compliance with changing laws, regulations and standards
relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,
including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations
and changes to the New York Stock Exchange rules, has required
us to expend significant resources and incur additional expenses
and will continue to do so. We are committed to maintaining the
highest standards of corporate governance and public disclosure.
As a result, we will continue to invest necessary resources to
comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this
investment may continue to result in increased general and
administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and
attention from revenue-generating activities.

The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of
our income tax returns by the IRS.

We are subject to continued examination of our income tax
returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no
assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations
will not have an adverse effect on future operating results.

Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2: Properties

Motorola’s principal executive offices are located at 1303
East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196. Motorola also
operates manufacturing facilities and sales offices in other
U.S. locations and in many other countries. (See
“Item 1: Business” for information regarding the
location of the principal manufacturing facilities for each of
Motorola’s business segments.) Motorola owns 49 facilities
(manufacturing, sales, service and office), 28 of which are
located in North America and 21 of which are located in other
countries. Motorola leases 275 facilities, 91 of which are
located in North America and 184 of which are located in other
countries.

As compared to 2004, the number of facilities owned or leased
was reduced primarily because of the optimization of space and
workplace mobility programs being utilized instead of adding
sites and space. In addition, as part of Motorola’s overall
strategy to reduce operating costs and improve the financial
performance of the corporation, a number of businesses and
facilities have either been sold or are currently for sale.
During 2005, facilities in Tianjin, China; Phoenix, AZ;
Harvard, IL; Beijing, China; Elgin, IL and land parcels in Ft.
Worth, TX; Tempe, AZ and Suwanee, GA were sold. Land parcels in
Elgin, IL are currently up for sale.

Motorola generally considers the productive capacity of the
plants operated by each of its business segments to be adequate
and sufficient for the requirements of each business group. The
extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies
from plant to plant and from time to time during the year.

A substantial portion of Motorola’s products are
manufactured in Asia, primarily China, either in our own
facilities or in the facilities of others who manufacture and
assemble products for Motorola. If manufacturing in the region
was disrupted, Motorola’s overall productive capacity could
be significantly reduced.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Personal Injury Cases

Cases relating to Wireless Telephone Usage

Motorola has been the defendant in several cases arising out of
its manufacture and sale of wireless telephones. On May 26,
2000, a purported nationwide class action suit

Naquin, et
al., v. Nokia Mobile Phones, et al

was filed against
Motorola and several other cellular phone manufacturers and
carriers in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans,
State of Louisiana. The case alleges that the failure to
incorporate a remote headset into cellular phones rendered the
phones defective by exposing users to biological injury and
health risks. In the Second Supplemental and Amending Class
Action Complaint, plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and
injunctive relief. Similar state class action suits were filed
on April 19, 2001, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City,
Maryland,



Pinney and Colonell v. Nokia, Inc., et al.

and in the
Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,

Farina v. Nokia, Inc., et al.;

on April 20, 2001, in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Bronx,

Gilliam et al., v. Nokia, Inc., et al.

; and on
June 8, 2001, in the Superior Court of Fulton County, State
of Georgia,

Gimpelson v. Nokia Inc, et. al.

During 2001, after removal to federal court, the Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL Panel”) transferred
these five cases to the United States District Court for the
District of Maryland (the “MDL Court”) for coordinated
or consolidated pretrial proceedings in the matter called

In
re Wireless Telephone Radio Frequency Emissions Products
Liability Litigation

(the “MDL Proceeding”). In
2005, as a result of a decision of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the

Pinney, Gilliam, Farina
and Gimpelson

cases were remanded to the state courts from
which they were removed (Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, and
Georgia, respectively). The Fourth Circuit decision also
reversed the MDL Court’s dismissal of the

Naquin

case on preemption grounds.

Naquin

was remanded to
the MDL Court for further proceedings.

On December 23, 2005, and again on February 9, 2006,
plaintiff filed amended complaints in

Farina

. Defendants
filed preliminary objections to the amended complaints. On
January 31, 2006, plaintiffs filed a second amended
complaint in

Pinney

. Both amended complaints seek
compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.

Farina

also seeks declaratory relief and treble and
statutory damages. For the first time plaintiffs in both

Farina

and

Pinney

added allegations that cellular
telephones sold without headsets are defective because they
present a safety risk when used while driving. On
February 17, 2006, a newly added defendant to the

Farina

and

Pinney

cases removed the cases to federal court.
Motorola asserted additional grounds for the

Pinney

removal in papers filed on February 22, 2006. On
January 30, 2006, plaintiff dismissed

Gimpelson

without prejudice.

On February 15, 2006, the MDL Court issued a suggestion to
the MDL Panel to transfer

Naquin

from the MDL Court to
the federal court in Louisiana. On February 22, 2006,
defendants filed a motion to reconsider that suggestion based on
the removal of

Farina

and

Pinney

to the federal
court.

During 2001 and 2002, several additional cases were filed
alleging that use of a cellular phone caused a malignant brain
tumor

: Murray v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

, filed
November 15, 2001, in the Superior Court of the District of
Columbia;

Agro et. al., v. Motorola, Inc., et al

., filed
February 26, 2002, in the Superior Court of the District of
Columbia;

Cochran et. al., v. Audiovox Corporation, et
al

., filed February 26, 2002, in the Superior Court of
the District of Columbia and S

chofield et. al., v. Matsushita
Electric Corporation of America, et al.

, filed
February 26, 2002, in the Superior Court of the District of
Columbia. Each complaint seeks compensatory damages in excess of
$25 million, consequential damages in excess of
$25 million and punitive and/or exemplary damages in excess
of $100 million. These cases were removed to federal court
and transferred to the MDL Court. On July 19, 2004, the MDL
Court found that there was no federal court jurisdiction over

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

and remanded
those cases to the Superior Court for the District of Columbia.
On November 30, 2004, defendants moved to dismiss the

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

complaints.
That motion remains pending before the Superior Court for the
District of Columbia.

Brower v. Motorola, Inc., et al.,

filed
April 19, 2001, in the Superior Court of the State of
California, County of San Diego, also seeks relief on behalf of
an individual who had brain cancer. A first amended complaint
was filed in

Brower

to add class allegations that
defendants engaged in deceptive and misleading actions by
falsely stating that cellular phones are safe and by failing to
disclose studies that allegedly show cellular phones can cause
harm.

Brower

seeks injunctive relief, restitution,
compensatory and punitive damages and disgorgement of profits.
On September 9, 2002,

Dahlgren v. Motorola, Inc., et
al.,

was filed in the D.C. Superior Court containing class
claims similar to

Brower

.

Dahlgren

seeks
injunctive and equitable relief, actual damages, treble or
statutory damages, punitive damages and a constructive trust.
These two cases were also removed to federal court and
transferred to the MDL Court. On June 10, 2005, the

Dahlgren

case was remanded to the Superior Court for the
District of Columbia. On December 9, 2005, plaintiff filed
an amended complaint in

Dahlgren

. Defendants moved to
dismiss

Dahlgren

on February 3, 2006. On
February 15, 2006, the MDL Court remanded

Brower

to
California state court.

Case relating to Two-Way Radio Usage

On January 23, 2004, Motorola was added as a co-defendant
with New York City in

Virgilio et al. v. Motorola
et al.,

filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs allege that twelve
firefighters died because the Motorola two-way radios they were
using on September 11, 2001 were defective and did not
receive evacuation orders because the City of New York and
Motorola committed wrongful acts in connection with a bid
process that was designed to provide new radios to the New York
City Fire



Department. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages
against Motorola in excess of $5 billion. On March 10,
2004, the court, to which all September 11 litigation has been
assigned, granted Motorola’s and the other defendant’s
motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that all of the

Virgilio

plaintiffs had filed claims with the
September 11th Victims’ Compensation Fund (the
“Fund”), that the statutory scheme clearly required
injured parties to elect between the remedy provided by this
Fund and the remedy of traditional litigation and that
plaintiffs, by pursuing the Fund, had chosen not to pursue
litigation. Subsequent appeals of the issue and petitions to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit have been
denied and the decision of the lower court dismissing the case
was affirmed. On October 13, 2005, plaintiffs filed a
petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court denied the petition on January 17,
2006, terminating all avenues of appeal.

Iridium-Related Cases

Class Action Securities Lawsuits

Motorola has been named as one of several defendants in putative
class action securities lawsuits arising out of alleged
misrepresentations or omissions regarding the Iridium satellite
communications business, which on March 15, 2001, were
consolidated in the District of Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications, Inc.,
et al.,

originally filed on April 22, 1999.

Bankruptcy Court Lawsuit

Motorola was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
Creditors of Iridium in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York on July 19, 2001.

In re Iridium
Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserts claims
for breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty, and fraudulent
transfer and preferences, and seeks in excess of $4 billion
in damages. Trial has been scheduled for August 7, 2006.

On March 30, 2001, the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York presiding over the Iridium
bankruptcy proceeding approved a settlement between the
unsecured creditors of the Iridium Debtors and the Iridium
Debtors’ pre-petition secured lenders. The settlement
agreement creates and provides for the funding of a litigation
vehicle for the purpose of pursuing litigation against Motorola.
Motorola appealed the approval of the settlement to the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On
April 7, 2005, the District Court entered an order denying
Motorola’s appeal and affirming the settlement. On
May 4, 2005, Motorola filed a notice of appeal to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The
appeal is pending.

Iridium India Lawsuits

Motorola and certain of its current and former officers and
directors were named as defendants in a private criminal
complaint filed by Iridium India Telecom Ltd. (“Iridium
India”) in October 2001 in the Court of the Extra Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Khadki, Pune, India. The

Iridium
India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola, Inc. et al.

complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to, and did,
commit the criminal offense of “cheating” by
fraudulently inducing Iridium India to purchase gateway
equipment from Motorola, to acquire Iridium stock, and to invest
in developing a market for Iridium services in India. Under the
Indian penal code, “cheating” is punishable by
imprisonment for up to 7 years and a fine of any amount.
The court may also require defendants to compensate the victim
for its losses, which the complaint estimates at about
$100 million. In August 2003, the Bombay High Court granted
Motorola’s petition to dismiss the criminal action against
Motorola and the individual defendants. Iridium India has
petitioned the Indian Supreme Court to exercise its discretion
to review that dismissal, and that petition is pending.

In September 2002, Iridium India also filed a civil suit in the
Bombay High Court against Motorola and Iridium. The suit alleges
fraud, intentional misrepresentation and negligent
misrepresentation by Motorola and Iridium in inducing Iridium
India to purchase gateway equipment from Motorola, to acquire
Iridium stock, and to invest in developing a market for Iridium
services in India. Iridium India claims in excess of
$200 million in damages and interest. Following extensive
proceedings in the trial court and on appeal related to Iridium
India’s motion for interim relief, Motorola has deposited
approximately $44 million in a specially designated account
in India, and the Indian Supreme Court has accepted for a full
hearing at a later date Motorola’s appeal regarding interim
relief.



Shareholder Derivative Case

M

&

C Partners III v. Galvin, et al.,

filed January 10, 2002, in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois, is a shareholder derivative action against
fifteen current and former members of the Motorola Board of
Directors and Motorola as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit
alleges that the Motorola directors breached their fiduciary
duty to the Company and/or committed gross mismanagement of
Motorola’s business and assets by allowing Motorola to
engage in improper practices with respect to Iridium. Following
the dismissal without prejudice of prior versions of the
complaint, in January 2006, plaintiff filed a motion for leave
to file a Third Amended Complaint, which remains pending.

In May 2004, plaintiff served a demand on the Motorola Board of
Directors to investigate the alleged wrongful conduct. In July
2004, Motorola’s Board appointed an investigatory committee
to evaluate the plaintiff’s demand. On July 26, 2005,
Motorola’s Board, acting on an extensive report from and
recommendations made by the investigatory committee, rejected
plaintiff’s demand.

An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the Iridium-related
cases still pending could have a material adverse effect on
Motorola’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Telsim-Related Cases

In April 2001, Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
(“Telsim”), a wireless telephone operator in Turkey,
defaulted on the payment of approximately $2 billion of
loans owed to Motorola and its subsidiaries (the “Telsim
Loans”). Motorola fully reserved the carrying value of the
Telsim Loans in the second quarter of 2002. The Uzan family
formerly controlled Telsim. Telsim remains under the control of
the Turkish government, pending the closing of the sale of
Telsim described below. Motorola is involved in several matters
related to Telsim.

October 2005 Settlement

On October 28, 2005, Motorola signed an agreement resolving
its disputes regarding the Telsim Loans with Telsim and the
Government of Turkey (the “Telsim Dispute Agreement”).
The parties to the Telsim Dispute Agreement are: Motorola, Inc.,
Motorola Credit Corporation, Motorola Limited, Motorola
Komunikasyon Ticaret ve Servis Limited Sirketi, Telsim, Rumeli
Telefon Sistemleri A.S. and Bayindirbank A.S. The Government of
Turkey and the Turkish Savings and Deposit Insurance Fund
(“TMSF”) are third-party beneficiaries of the Telsim
Dispute Agreement. As part of the Telsim Dispute Agreement, on
October 28, 2005, Motorola received a cash payment of
$500 million. On December 13, 2005, Vodafone agreed to
purchase Telsim for $4.55 billion, pursuant to a sales
process organized by the TMSF. This purchase has not yet been
completed. Pursuant to the Telsim Dispute Agreement, Motorola
has the right to receive 20% of the sale proceeds above
$2.5 billion, in addition to the cash payment of
$500 million it received in 2005, once this transaction is
completed. Although there can be no assurances as to when or if
the sale will close, the Company currently expects to receive
$410 million in the second quarter of 2006.

As part of the Telsim Dispute Agreement, and subject to certain
conditions, Motorola has agreed that it will not pursue
collection efforts against the three corporate defendants under
TMSF control (Unikom Iletisim Hizmetleri Pazarlama A.S.,
Standart Pazarlama A.S., and Standart Telekomunikasyon
Bilgisayar Hizmetleri A.S.) (the “Corporate
Defendants”), that are subject to its final judgment in the
U.S. courts related to the matter. The Telsim Dispute
Agreement permits Motorola to continue its efforts (except in
Turkey and three other countries, which restriction is subject
to certain conditions) to enforce the U.S. Judgment described
below against the Uzan family. In addition, pursuant to the
Telsim Dispute Agreement, Telsim and its related companies have
dismissed all litigation, including arbitrations, pending
against Motorola.

U.S. Judgment

The Company continues to realize collections on its judgment of
$2.13 billion (the “U.S. Judgment”) for
compensatory damages rendered by the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District
Court”) against the Uzans on July 31, 2003 and
affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (the “Second Circuit”) in 2004 and in
connection with foreign proceedings against the Uzan family.
However, the Company believes that the ongoing litigation,
collection and/or settlement processes against the Uzan family
will be very lengthy in light of the Uzans’ continued
resistance to satisfy the judgment against them and their
decision to violate various courts’ orders, including
orders holding them in contempt of court. Following a remand



from the Second Circuit of the July 31, 2003
$2.13 billion punitive damages award by the District Court,
on February 8, 2006, the District Court awarded a judgment
in favor of Motorola for $1 billion in punitive damages
against the Uzan family and their co-conspirator, Antonio Luna
Bettancourt.

Class Action Securities Lawsuits

A purported class action lawsuit,

Barry Family LP v.
Carl F. Koenemann

, was filed against the former chief
financial officer of Motorola on December 24, 2002 in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
SEC Rule

10b-5.

It
has been consolidated before the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois (the “Illinois
District Court”) with 18 additional putative class action
complaints which were filed in various federal courts against
the Company, its former chief financial officer and various
other individuals, alleging that the price of Motorola’s
stock was artificially inflated by a failure to disclose vendor
financing to Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
(Telsim), in connection with the sale of telecommunications
equipment by Motorola as well as other related aspects of
Motorola’s dealings with Telsim. In each of the complaints,
plaintiffs proposed a class period of February 3, 2000
through May 14, 2001, and sought an unspecified amount of
damages. On August 25, 2004, the Illinois District Court
issued its decision on Motorola’s motion to dismiss,
granting the motion in part and denying it in part. The court
dismissed without prejudice the fraud claims against the
individual defendants and denied the motion to dismiss as to
Motorola. The plaintiffs chose not to file an amended complaint;
therefore, the fraud claims against the individual defendants
are dismissed. The court, however, declined to dismiss the
plaintiffs’ claims that the individual defendants were
“controlling persons of Motorola.” During 2005, the
Court certified the case as a class action. No trial date is
scheduled in the case at present.

A purported class action,

Howell v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al.,

was filed against Motorola and various of its
officers and employees in the Illinois District Court on
July 21, 2003, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and
violations of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act
(“ERISA”). The complaint alleged that the defendants
had improperly permitted participants in Motorola’s 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase or hold
shares of common stock of Motorola because the price of
Motorola’s stock was artificially inflated by a failure to
disclose vendor financing to Telsim in connection with the sale
of telecommunications equipment by Motorola. The plaintiff
sought to represent a class of participants in the Plan for
whose individual accounts the Plan purchased or held shares of
common stock of Motorola from “May 16, 2000 to the
present”, and sought an unspecified amount of damages. On
October 3, 2003, plaintiff filed an amended complaint
asserting three claims for breach of fiduciary duties under
ERISA against 24 defendants grouped into five categories and
seeking an unspecified amount of damages. On September 23,
2004, the Illinois District Court dismissed the plan committee
defendants from the case, without prejudice. On October 15,
2004, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (the
“Howell Complaint”) and a motion for class
certification. On December 3, 2004, defendants filed a
motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss the Howell
Complaint and a corresponding motion to deny class
certification. On September 30, 2005, the Illinois District
Court granted defendants’ motion and dismissed the Howell
Complaint. Plaintiff filed an appeal to the dismissal on
October 27, 2005. In addition, on October 19, 2005,
plaintiff’s counsel filed a motion seeking to add a new
lead plaintiff and assert the same claims set forth in the
Howell Complaint.

Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation

Motorola is involved in an ongoing investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding Telsim matters,
which remains outstanding.

Charter Communications Class Action Securities
Litigation

On August 5, 2002, Stoneridge Investment Partners LLC filed
a purported class action in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Missouri against Charter Communications,
Inc. (“Charter”) and certain of its officers, alleging
violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and
Rule

10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to Charter securities. This
complaint did not name Motorola as a defendant, but asserted
that Charter and the other named defendants had violated the
securities laws in connection with,

inter alia,

a
transaction with Motorola. On August 5, 2003, the plaintiff
amended its complaint to add Motorola, Inc. as a defendant. As
to Motorola, the amended complaint alleges a claim under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule

10b-5(a)

-(c)
promulgated thereunder relating to Charter securities and seeks
an award of



compensatory damages. On October 12, 2004, the court
granted Motorola’s motion to dismiss, holding that there is
no civil liability under the federal securities laws for aiding
and abetting. On October 26, 2004, the plaintiff filed a
motion for the reconsideration of the court’s decision. On
December 20, 2004, the court issued its ruling denying
plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of its earlier
decision to dismiss the complaint against Motorola. The court
issued a final judgment dismissing Motorola from the case on
February 15, 2005. Plaintiff appealed to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. An oral argument was
held on that appeal on December 12, 2005.

In re Adelphia Communications Corp. Securities and
Derivative Litigation

On December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a defendant in
two cases relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation

(the “Adelphia
MDL”). The Adelphia MDL consists of at least fourteen
individual cases and one purported class action that were filed
in or have been transferred to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. First, Motorola was named
as a defendant in the Second Amended Complaint in the individual
case of

W.R. Huff Asset Management Co. L.L.C. v.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, et al.

(the “Huff
Complaint”) This case was originally filed by W.R. Huff
Asset Management Co. L.L.C. on June 7, 2002, in the United
States District Court for the Western District of New York and
was subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New
York as related to the Adelphia MDL. Several other individual
and corporate defendants are also named in the amended complaint
along with Motorola.

As to Motorola, the complaint alleges a claim arising under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule

10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to Adelphia securities, and
seeks recovery of the consideration paid by plaintiff for
Adelphia debt securities, compensatory damages, costs and
expenses of litigation and other relief. Motorola filed a motion
to dismiss this complaint on March 8, 2004 which is
awaiting decision.

Also on December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a
defendant in

Stocke v. John J. Rigas, et al.

This case was originally filed in Pennsylvania and was
subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New York as
related to the Adelphia MDL. Several other individual and
corporate defendants are also named in the amended complaint
along with Motorola. As to Motorola, the complaint generally
makes the same allegations as the Huff Complaint and a state law
claim of aiding and abetting fraud relating to Adelphia
securities. The complaint seeks return of the consideration paid
by plaintiff for Adelphia securities, punitive damages and other
relief. Motorola filed a motion to dismiss this complaint on
April 12, 2004 which is awaiting decision.

On July 23, 2004, Motorola was named as a defendant in

Argent Classic Convertible Arbitrage Fund L.P.,
et al. v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., et al.

(the “Argent Complaint”). The Argent Complaint was
filed against Scientific Atlanta and Motorola in the Southern
District of New York. The Argent Complaint generally makes the
same allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases
relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have been
transferred to the Southern District of New York. The complaint
seeks compensatory damages and other relief. On October 12,
2004, Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the Argent Complaint
which is awaiting decision.

On September 14, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
filed in state court in Los Angeles, California, naming Motorola
and Scientific-Atlanta and certain officers of
Scientific-Atlanta,

Los Angeles County Employees Retirement
Association et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

The complaint raises claims under California law for aiding and
abetting fraud and conspiracy to defraud and generally makes the
same allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases
relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have been
transferred to the Southern District of New York. There are no
new substantive allegations. The complaint seeks compensatory
damages, opportunity-cost damages, punitive and other exemplary
damages and other relief. On October 8, 2004, Motorola
filed a motion to remove the California state court case to
federal court in California. On December 1, 2004, the
Multi-District Litigation Panel issued a conditional transfer
order transferring the case to federal court in New York.
Plaintiffs did not object to the conditional transfer order, and
the order transferring the case to New York is now final. On
September 19, 2005, Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint in this action which is awaiting decision.

On October 25, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
filed in state court in Fulton County, Georgia, naming Motorola
and Scientific-Atlanta and certain officers of
Scientific-Atlanta,

AIG DKR SoundShore Holdings, Ltd.,
et al. v. Scientific-Atlanta Inc., et al.

The
complaint raises claims under Georgia law of conspiracy to
defraud and generally makes the same allegations as the other
previously disclosed cases relating to the

In re Adelphia
Communications Corp. Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have already been filed and transferred to the Southern
District of New York. The complaint seeks damages and statutory
compensation, punitive damages and other relief. On
November 22, 2004, Motorola filed a petition to remove the
state court case to federal court in



Georgia and a notice with the Multi-District Litigation
requesting the case be transferred to New York. On
January 5, 2005, the Multi-District Litigation issued a
conditional transfer order, transferring the case to federal
court in New York. On April 18, 2005, the Multi-District
Litigation Panel issued a final order transferring the case to
New York and that transfer is final. On September 19, 2005,
Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in this action
which is awaiting decision.

Motorola is a defendant in various other suits, claims and
investigations that arise in the normal course of business. In
the opinion of management, and other than discussed above with
respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate disposition of the
Company’s pending legal proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial
position and results of operations for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005. This commentary
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto which appear beginning under
“Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.”

Executive Overview

What businesses are we in?

Motorola reports financial results for the following four
operating business segments:

What were our 2005 financial highlights?

•

Net Sales Increased 18%:

Our net sales were
    $36.8 billion in 2005, up 18% from $31.3 billion in
    2004. Sales increased in all four of our operating segments.

•

Operating Earnings Increased 50%:

We generated operating
    earnings of $4.7 billion in 2005, an increase of 50%
    compared to operating earnings of $3.1 billion in 2004.
    Operating margin increased to 12.7% in 2005, compared to 10.0%
    in 2004.

•

Earnings From Continuing Operations Increased by 110%:

We
    generated earnings from continuing operations of
    $4.6 billion in 2005, an increase of 110% compared to
    earnings from continuing operations of $2.2 billion in 2004.

*

When discussing the net sales of each of our four segments, we
    express the segment’s net sales as a percentage of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales. Because certain of our
    segments sell products to other Motorola businesses, our
    intracompany sales were eliminated as part of the consolidation
    process in 2005. As a result, the percentages of consolidated
    net sales for each of our business segments sums to greater than
    100% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

Earnings From Continuing Operations of $1.82 per
    Share:

Our earnings from continuing operations per diluted
    common share were $1.82 in 2005, compared to earnings from
    continuing operations per diluted common share of $0.90 in 2004.

•

Net Cash

*

Increased by $5.1 Billion:

We increased
    our net cash position by $5.1 billion during 2005 and ended
    the year with a record net cash position of $10.5 billion.

What drove the $2.4 billion increase in earnings from
continuing operations?

The key contributors to the substantial increase in earnings
from continuing operations were:

What were the financial highlights for our four operating
segments in 2005?

•

In Mobile Devices:

Net sales increased by
    $4.3 billion, or 25%, to $21.5 billion and operating
    earnings increased by 27% to $2.2 billion. We shipped
    146 million handsets in 2005, up 40% from 2004 and
    solidified our position as the second largest worldwide supplier
    of wireless handsets with an estimated 17% global market share.
    The increase in unit shipments was attributed to an increase in
    the size of the total market and a gain in the segment’s
    market share. The gain in market share reflected strong demand
    for GSM handsets and consumers’ desire for the
    segment’s compelling products that combine innovative style
    leading technology. The segment had increased net sales in all
    regions of the world as a result of an improved product
    portfolio, strong market growth in emerging markets, and high
    replacement sales in more mature markets. Average selling price
    (“ASP”) decreased approximately 10% compared to 2004,
    driven primarily by a higher percentage of lower-tier,
    lower-priced handsets in the overall sales mix.

•

In Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions:

Net
    sales increased $369 million, or 6%, to $6.6 billion
    and operating earnings increased by 5% to $882, primarily due to
    increased sales to the segment’s government and enterprise
    markets, partially offset by a decrease in sales to the
    automotive electronics market, reflecting weak automobile
    industry conditions. The increase in net sales in the government
    market was driven by customer spending on enhanced

mission-critical

communications and the continued focus on homeland security
    initiatives. The increase in net sales in the enterprise market
    reflects enterprise customers’ demand for business-critical
    communications. The overall increase in net sales reflects net
    sales growth in the Americas and Asia.

•

In Networks:

Net sales increased $306 million, or
    5%, to $6.3 billion and operating earnings increased by 38%
    to $990 million, primarily driven by increased customer
    purchases of cellular infrastructure equipment, as well as
    increased sales of wireless broadband systems and embedded
    computing communications systems. On a geographic basis, net
    sales increased in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region
    (“EMEA”) and North America, which offset lower sales
    in Asia and Latin America. The segment’s 5% increase in net
    sales was reflective of the overall sales growth in the
    industry, yet resulted in a slight loss of market share for the
    segment. The 38% increase in operating earnings was primarily
    related to an increase in gross margin, which was due to:
    (i) the 5% increase in net sales, and
    (ii) improvements in cost structure.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

In Connected Home Solutions:

Net sales increased
    $551 million, or 25%, to $2.8 billion and operating
    earnings increased by 27% to $185 million, primarily driven
    by increases in both ASP and unit shipments of digital set-top
    boxes. The segment experienced an increase in net sales in the
    North America, Latin America and Asia regions, which was
    partially offset by a slight decrease in net sales in the EMEA
    region. Net sales of digital set-top boxes increased 34%, driven
    by a product-mix shift towards higher-end products, particularly
    HD/ DVR set-top boxes. The segment continued to be the worldwide
    leader in market share for digital cable set-top boxes. Net
    sales of cable modems increased 9%, primarily due to an increase
    in cable modem unit shipments, which was partially offset by the
    decline in ASP for cable modems. The segment retained its
    leading worldwide market share in cable modems.

What were our other major accomplishments in 2005?

In 2005, we were focused first and foremost on increasing
profitable sales and growing market share. We realigned our
structure to better enable our vision of seamless mobility, now
serving our customers through four business units: Mobile
Devices, Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions,
Networks and Connected Home Solutions.

•

Mobile Devices:

During 2005, Motorola expanded its global
    market share in mobile handsets to 17%. The Company is a strong,
    profitable and growing #2. For example, during the year,
    Motorola grew unit shipments faster than the market and faster
    than all competitors. Motorola ended 2005 as the market-share
    leader in North America and Latin America, as the clear #2 in
    Europe, as the new #2 in North Asia, and as the rapidly growing
    #3 in the world’s high-growth markets. In India, the
    Company announced a new distribution partnership with Bharti to
    expand and extend Motorola’s reach to consumers. Around the
    world, Motorola is driving profitable and sustainable growth
    through a strategy that focuses on design and the
    “re-invention” of each of the six primary handset form
    factors: clamshell, candy bar, PDA, QWERTY, slider and rotator.

Motorola launched this strategy at the end of 2004 with
    MOTORAZR, using the innovative clamshell design to strengthen
    the brand, and transformed 2005 into the “Year of the
    RAZR”. RAZR is available worldwide across the leading
    mobile-interface technologies: GSM, GPRS, UMTS, CDMA 1X,
    EV-DO and Dual-Mode UMA. Additionally, Motorola built consumer
    excitement and demand for MOTORAZR with an expanding series of
    highly sought after fashionable colors from silver to black,
    blue, three shades of pink and the exclusive Dolce & Gabbana
    gold edition. Since its launch, Motorola has sold more than
    23 million RAZRs.

Motorola expanded the ultra-thin platform in 2005 to include an
    additional clamshell — the fashionable Motorola PEBL
    U6 and the game-changing candy-bar design known as SLVR. In
    addition to great design, Motorola is delivering compelling
    mobile experiences from mobile music and mobile imaging to
    mobile search and hands-free/wire-free seamless mobility. For
    example, during 2005, Motorola launched “mobile music
    1.0” with Motorola ROKR E1 — the world’s
    first iTunes-enabled mobile handset. The Company also created a
    new category of wireless wearables — joining forces
    with brands such as Burton for a Bluetooth-enabled, mobile music
    winter-sports jacket and with Oakley to create a new category of
    wireless, Bluetooth-enabled eyewear with MOTORAZR sunglasses.

Additionally, Motorola is expanding to markets that have
    previously been underserved. In February 2005, the GSM
    Association (“GSMA”) named Motorola as its partner in
    the GSMA’s drive to “Connect the Unconnected”
    with the Emerging Market Handset program. The program focuses on
    enabling economic and social development by providing
    affordable, high-quality access to mobile communications in such
    markets as India, the Philippines, Indonesia and Africa. By the
    end of 2006, Motorola and the GSMA expect to have connected more
    than 20 million people for whom wireless communications had
    previously been only an unaffordable and unattainable dream.

•

Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions:

The
    Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions business once again
    delivered solid results in 2005, solidifying its leadership in
    the markets it serves. Motorola remains the market leader in
    embedded telematics systems and is #1 in mission-critical
    wireless communications systems and two-way radio systems. In
    2005, we introduced our first entry into the commercial,
    off-the-shelf rugged handheld mobile computing market.

•

Networks:

At our Networks business, Motorola maintained
    momentum in 2005 by delivering outstanding technologies and
    services for wireless and wireline carriers. The Networks
    business deployed push-to-

talk over cellular (“PoC”) technology for 44 wireless
    carriers in 33 countries and territories in 2005. Based on IMS
    technology, Motorola’s PoC solution lays the foundation for
    further “Push-To” applications. Networks also
    introduced its MOTOwi4 product portfolio for unlicensed spectrum
    and WiMAX broadband solutions — designed to meet the
    different needs of operators for lower-cost delivery of data
    rich multimedia applications and services.

•

Connected Home Solutions:

The Connected Home Solutions
    business is the world’s leading provider of digital video
    set-top boxes and cable modems. In 2005, Motorola shipped its
    40 millionth digital video set-top box and its
    30 millionth cable modem, both significant milestones. We
    shipped over 6.4 million set-top boxes in the year, almost
    half of which were high-definition TV
    (“HDTV”) capable, and 9 million cable
    modems, of which 1.6 million were voice-over-IP
    (“VoIP”) capable.

Motorola also entered into joint ventures with Comcast for the
    development and licensing of next-generation conditional access
    technologies. We began implementing a multi-year contract to
    build Verizon’s digital video network infrastructure and
    provide advanced consumer products, including the first digital
    set-top boxes to incorporate home media networking. We were
    named a set-top box supplier for AT&T’s IPTV
    deployment, our digital video delivery platform was selected by
    VTR in Chile for the launch of digital cable services, and we
    launched a digital terrestrial television
    (“DTT”) set-top box for use in Europe.

During 2005, Motorola was awarded the National Medal of
Technology for its outstanding contributions to America’s
technological innovation and competitiveness over its more than

75-year

history. The
National Medal of Technology, established in 1980 by an act of
Congress, is the highest honor awarded by the President to
America’s leading innovators. The award recognizes that
since its founding in 1928, Motorola has stood on the cutting
edge of innovation in areas such as two-way radios, cellular
communication, paging, space flight communication,
semiconductors and integrated, digital enhanced networks. As a
result, the Company has helped establish entirely new industries
and driven the phenomenal growth of mobile communications.

Looking Forward

In 2006, we will build upon our 2005 achievements with our
continued commitment to quality and our unrelenting focus on
innovation. We will continue to pursue profitable market share
growth across all our businesses.

We are focused on our seamless mobility strategy. Seamless
mobility recognizes that the boundaries between work, home,
entertainment and leisure continue to dissolve. As we move
between different environments, devices and networks, seamless
mobility will deliver fluid experiences across the home,
vehicle, office and beyond. Motorola is a thought leader on
digital convergence.

As we develop seamless mobility, we remain committed to
delivering compelling products in all our businesses. We will
continue to build on the success of the MOTORAZR with ultra thin
products, including the introduction of the QWERTY design known
as the Q, in 2006. We will continue to invest in
next-generation, mission-critical data, video and security, and
mesh technology to enable us to offer the most compelling
products to public-safety agencies and other government
customers. We will continue to build our enterprise business by
offering products that enable the mobile enterprise. We will
continue to develop and offer next-generation infrastructure
networks that enable the mobile Internet and lead us to a
seamless world.

2006 will not be without challenges. We conduct our business in
highly-competitive markets, facing new and established
competitors. We also face technological and other industry
challenges in developing seamless mobility products. Full
digital convergence will require technological advancements and
significant investment in research and development. The research
and development of new, technologically advanced product is a
complex process requiring high levels of innovations, as well as
accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. During
the year, we will continue to focus on improving the quality of
our products and on enhancing our supply chain to ensure that we
can meet customer demand and improve efficiency. However, we
believe that despite these challenges, our seamless mobility
strategy and our compelling products will result in a successful
2006.

Results of Operations— 2005 Compared to 2004

Net Sales

Net sales were $36.8 billion in 2005, up 18% from
$31.3 billion in 2004. Net sales increased in all four of
the Company’s segments in 2005 compared to 2004. The
overall increase in net sales reflected: (i) a
$4.3 billion increase in net sales by the Mobile Devices
segment, driven by a 40% increase in unit shipments, reflecting
strong demand for GSM handsets and consumers’ desire for
the segment’s compelling products that combine innovative
style and leading technology, (ii) a $551 million
increase in net sales by the Connected Home Solutions segment,
primarily driven by increases in both average selling price
(“ASP”) and unit shipments of digital set-top boxes,
(iii) a $369 million increase in net sales by the
Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment, reflecting

automotive electronics market, and (iv) a $306 million
increase in net sales by the Networks segment, driven by
increased customer purchases of cellular infrastructure
equipment, as well as increased sales of wireless broadband
systems and embedded computing communications systems.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $11.8 billion, or 32.0% of net sales, in
2005, compared to $10.4 billion, or 33.1% of net sales, in
2004. Two of the Company’s four operating segments had a
decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales:
(i) Mobile Devices, primarily due to a higher percentage of
lower-tier, lower-priced, lower margin handsets in the overall
sales mix and a charge for past use of Kodak intellectual
property, and (ii) Connected Home Solutions, primarily due
to increased sales of high-definition digital video recording
(“HD/DVR”) products, which carry lower margins. These
changes in gross margin percentage were partially offset by
increased gross margin as a percentage of net sales by Networks,
primarily due to the increase in net sales and cost savings from
improvements in supply-chain management. Gross margin as a
percentage of net sales was relatively flat in 2005 compared to
2004 for the Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions
segment.

The Company’s overall gross margin as a percentage of net
sales can be impacted by the proportion of overall net sales
generated by its various businesses. The decrease in overall
gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared to
2004 can be partially attributed to the fact that an increased
percentage of the Company’s net sales were generated by the
Mobile Devices and Connected Home Solutions segments, two
segments that generate lower gross margins than the overall
Company average.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expenditures increased 4% to $3.9 billion, or 10.5% of net
sales, in 2005, compared to $3.7 billion, or 11.9% of net
sales, in 2004. All four of the Company’s segments had
increased SG&A expenditures in 2005 compared to 2004. These
increases in SG&A for the segments were offset by a decrease
in SG&A expenditures related to corporate functions. The
increase in SG&A expenditures in 2005 compared to 2004 was
due to: (i) increased advertising and promotional
expenditures in Mobile Devices to support higher sales and
promote brand awareness, (ii) increased selling and sales
support expenditures in all four operating segments, driven by
the increase in sales commissions resulting from the increase in
net sales, and (iii) increased marketing expenditures in
three of the four of the segments. SG&A expenditures as a
percentage of net sales decreased in two of the four segments.

Research and Development Expenditures

Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
increased 8% to $3.7 billion, or 10.0% of net sales, in
2005, compared to $3.4 billion, or 10.9% of net sales, in
2004. All four of the Company’s segments had increased
R&D expenditures in 2005 compared to 2004, although R&D
expenditures as percentage of net sales decreased in three of
the four segments. The increase in R&D expenditures was
primarily due to developmental engineering expenditures for new
product development and investment in next-generation
technologies across all segments.

Other Charges (Income)

The Company recorded net Other income of $458 million in
Other charges (income) in 2005, compared to net charges of
$96 million in 2004. The net other income of
$458 million in 2005 primarily consisted of
$500 million in income from the settlement of financial and
legal claims against Telsim. This item was partially offset by a
$66 million net charge for reorganization of businesses.
The reorganization of businesses costs are discussed in further
detail in the “Reorganization of Businesses” section
below.

The net charges of $96 million in 2004 primarily consisted
of: (i) a $125 million charge for goodwill impairment,
related to the sensor business that was divested in 2005, and
(ii) $34 million of charges for in-process research
and development. These items were partially offset by:
(i) $44 million in income from the reversal of
financing receivable reserves due to the partial collection of
the previously-uncollected receivable from Telsim, and
(ii) $15 million in net reorganization of businesses
reversals for reserves no longer needed. The reorganization of
businesses costs are discussed in further detail in the
“Reorganization of Businesses” section below.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Interest Income (Expense)

Net interest income was $71 million in 2005, compared to
net interest expense of $199 million in 2004. The Company
generated net interest income in 2005 and the Company currently
expects to have net interest income in 2006 as well. Net
interest income in 2005 included interest income of
$396 million, partially offset by interest expense of
$325 million. Net interest expense in 2004 included
interest expense of $353 million, partially offset by
interest income of $154 million. The increase in net
interest income in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects: (i) an
increase in interest income due primarily to higher average
cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Funds balances at higher
interest rates, and (ii) the significantly lower levels of
total debt in 2005 compared to 2004.

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
$1.9 billion in 2005, compared to $460 million in
2004. The 2005 net gains were primarily: (i) a
$1.3 billion net gain recognized when the Company received
69.3 million shares of Sprint Nextel Corporation
(“Sprint Nextel”), as well as $46 million in
cash, in exchange for the Company’s shares of Nextel
Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”) when Sprint
Corporation and Nextel completed their merger in August 2005,
and (ii) a $609 million net gain recognized on the
sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Nextel during
the first half of 2005. These gains were partially offset by a
net loss of $70 million on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Sprint Nextel in the fourth quarter of
2005.

The 2004 net gains were primarily: (i) a
$130 million gain on the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation, (ii) a
$122 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel, (iii) an $82 million
gain on the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in
Telus Corporation, and (iv) a $68 million gain on the
sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Nextel
Partners, Inc. (“Nextel Partners”)

Other

Charges classified as Other, as presented in Other income
(expense), were $108 million in 2005, compared to
$141 million in 2004. The $108 million of net charges
in 2005 primarily were (i) $137 million of debt
retirement costs, (ii) foreign currency losses of
$38 million, and (iii) $25 million of investment
impairment charges. These items were partially offset by:
(i) $51 million in income recognized in connection
with a derivative relating to a portion of the Company’s
investment in Sprint Nextel, and (ii) $30 million in
income from the repayment of a previously-reserved loan related
to Iridium.

The $141 million of net charges in 2004 primarily were:
(i) charges of $81 million for costs related to the
redemption of debt, (ii) foreign currency losses of
$44 million, and (iii) $36 million of investment
impairment charges.

Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 29% in 2005, representing a
$1.9 billion net tax expense, compared to a 33% effective
tax rate in 2004, representing a $1.1 billion net tax
expense. The 2005 tax rate reflects a $265 million net tax
benefit related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under
the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and an
$81 million net tax benefit on the stock sale of a sensor
business that was divested in 2005.

The 2004 effective tax rate reflects a $241 million benefit
from the reversal of previously-accrued income taxes as the
result of settlements reached with taxing authorities and a
reassessment of tax exposures based on the status of current
audits, offset by nondeductible charges of $125 million for
goodwill impairment related to a sensor business that was
divested in 2005 and $31 million for in-process research
and development (“IPR&D”) charges related to
acquisitions.

Earnings from Continuing Operations

The Company had earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes of $6.5 billion in 2005, compared to earnings
from continuing operations before income taxes of
$3.3 billion in 2004. After taxes, the Company had earnings
from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or
$1.82 per diluted share from continuing operations, in
2005, compared to earnings from continuing operations of
$2.2 billion, or $0.90 per diluted share from
continuing operations, in 2004.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The $3.3 billion increase in earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes is primarily attributed to:
(i) a $1.4 billion increase in gains on sales of
investments and businesses, due primarily to a $1.3 billion
net gain recognized by the Company when it received cash and
shares of Sprint Nextel in exchange for its shares of Nextel
when Sprint and Nextel completed their merger in August 2005,
(ii) a $1.4 billion increase in gross margin,
primarily due to the $5.5 billion increase in total net
sales, (iii) a $554 million increase in income
classified as Other, primarily due to $500 million received
from the settlement of financial and legal claims against
Telsim, (iv) a $270 million increase in net interest
income, driven primarily by the reduction in total debt and
increased interest income due to higher average cash, cash
equivalents and Sigma Funds balances at higher interest rates,
and (v) a $33 million decrease in Other Charges. These
improvements in earnings were partially offset by: (i) a
$268 million increase in R&D expenditures, due
primarily to an increase in developmental engineering
expenditures as a result of additional investment in new product
development and increased investment in new technologies across
all segments, and (ii) a $145 million increase in
SG&A expenditures.

Results of Operations— 2004 Compared to 2003

Net Sales

Net sales were $31.3 billion in 2004, up 35% from
$23.2 billion in 2003. Net sales increased in all four
segments in 2004 compared to 2003. The overall increase in net
sales was primarily related to: (i) a $5.9 billion
increase in net sales by the Mobile Devices segment, primarily
driven by a 39% increase in unit shipments, reflecting strong
consumer demand for new products, partially offset by a 15%
decrease in ASP, (ii) a $1.2 billion increase in net
sales by the Networks segment, driven by a continued increase in
spending by the segment’s wireless service provider
customers and reflecting sales growth in all technologies and
regions, (iii) a $660 million increase in net sales by
the Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment,
reflecting increased spending by customers in the segment’s
government, enterprise and automotive markets, and (iv) a
$469 million increase in net sales by the Connected Home
Solutions segment, primarily due to increased purchases of
digital cable set-top boxes by cable operators and an increase
in ASP for digital set-top boxes due to a mix shift towards
higher-end products.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $10.4 billion, or 33.1% of net sales, in
2004, compared to $7.5 billion, or 32.4% of net sales, in
2003. All four segments had increased gross margin compared to
2004. Three of the four segments had a higher gross margin as a
percentage of net sales, including: (i) Mobile Devices,
primarily due to the increase in net sales and cost savings from
ongoing cost-reduction activities and improvements in
supply-chain management, (ii) Networks, primarily due to
the increase in net sales and cost savings from improvements in
supply-chain management, and (iii) Government and
Enterprise Mobility Solutions, primarily due to the increase in
net sales, cost savings from supply-chain efficiencies and
overall cost structure improvements. These improvements in gross
margin percentage were partially offset by a decrease in gross
margin as a percentage of net sales in Connected Home Solutions,
primarily due to higher sales of new, higher-tier products
carrying lower initial margins.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenditures increased 13% to $3.7 billion, or
11.9% of net sales, in 2004, compared to $3.3 billion, or
14.2% of net sales, in 2003. Three of the Company’s four
segments had increased SG&A expenditures in 2004 compared to
2003, although SG&A expenditures as percentage of net sales
decreased in all four segments. The increase in SG&A
expenditures in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to:
(i) increased advertising and promotional expenditures in
Mobile Devices to support higher sales and promote brand
awareness, (ii) increased selling and sales support
expenditures in three of the four segments, driven by the
increase in sales commissions resulting from the increase in net
sales, and (iii) increased marketing expenditures in all
four segments.

Research and Development Expenditures

R&D expenditures increased 15% to $3.4 billion, or
10.9% of net sales, in 2004, compared to $3.0 billion, or
12.9% of net sales, in 2003. All four of the Company’s
segments had increased R&D expenditures in 2004 compared to
2003, although R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales
decreased in three of the four segments. The increase in R&D
expenditures was primarily due to increased expenditures by:
(i) Mobile Devices, reflecting an increase in developmental
engineering expenditures due to additional investment in new
product

development, and (ii) Government and Enterprise Mobility
Solutions driven by increased investment in new technologies.

Other Charges (Income)

The Company recorded net charges of $96 million in Other
charges (income) in 2004, compared to net other income of
$34 million in 2003. The net charges of $96 million in
2004 primarily consisted of: (i) a $125 million charge
for goodwill impairment, related to the sensor business that was
divested in 2005, and (ii) $34 million of charges for
IPR&D related to the acquisitions of MeshNetworks, Inc.,
CRISNET, Inc., Quantum Bridge and Force Computers. These items
were partially offset by: (i) $44 million in income
from the reversal of financing receivable reserves due to the
partial collection of the previously-uncollected receivable from
Telsim, and (ii) $15 million in net reorganization of
businesses reversals for reserves no longer needed. The
reorganization of businesses costs are discussed in further
detail in the “Reorganization of Businesses” section
below.

The net other income of $34 million in 2003 primarily
consisted of: (i) $69 million in income from the
reversal of accruals no longer needed due to a settlement with
the Company’s insurer on items related to previous
environmental claims, (ii) $59 million in income due
to the reassessment of remaining reserve requirements as a
result of a litigation settlement agreement with The Chase
Manhattan Bank regarding Iridium, and
(iii) $41 million in income from the sale of
Iridium-related assets that were previously written down. These
items were partially offset by: (i) a $73 million
impairment charge relating to goodwill,
(ii) $32 million of IPR&D charges, and
(iii) a $23 million net charge for reorganization of
businesses. The reorganization of businesses costs are discussed
in further detail in the “Reorganization of
Businesses” section below.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was $199 million in 2004, compared to
$294 million in 2003. Net interest expense in 2004 included
interest expense of $353 million, partially offset by
interest income of $154 million. Net interest expense in
2003 included interest expense of $423 million, partially
offset by interest income of $129 million. The decrease in
net interest expense in 2004 compared to 2003 reflects:
(i) a reduction in total debt during 2004,
(ii) benefits derived from

fixed-to

-floating
interest rate swaps, and (iii) an increase in interest
income due to higher average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma
Funds balances.

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
$460 million in 2004, compared to $539 million in
2003. The 2004 net gains were primarily: (i) a
$130 million gain on the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation, (ii) a
$122 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel, (iii) an $82 million
gain on the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in
Telus Corporation, and (iv) a $68 million gain on the
sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Nextel
Partners.

The 2003 net gains were primarily: (i) a
$255 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel, (ii) an $80 million
gain on the sale of the Company’s shares in Symbian
Limited, (iii) a $65 million gain on the sale of the
Company’s shares in UAB Omnitel of Lithuania, and
(iv) a $61 million gain on the sale of a portion of
the Company’s shares in Nextel Partners.

Other

Charges classified as Other, as presented in Other income
(expense), were $141 million in 2004, compared to
$142 million in 2003. The $141 million of charges in
2004 primarily were: (i) charges of $81 million for
costs related to the redemption of debt, (ii) foreign
currency losses of $44 million, and
(iii) $36 million of investment impairment charges.

The $142 million of charges in 2003 primarily related to:
(i) $96 million of investment impairment charges, and
(ii) foreign currency losses of $73 million.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 33% in both 2004 and 2003,
representing net tax expense of $1.1 billion and
$448 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004
effective tax rate reflects a $241 million benefit from the
reversal of previously-accrued income taxes as the result of
settlements reached with taxing authorities and a reassessment
of tax exposures based on the status of current audits. The 2004
effective tax rate also reflects non-deductible charges of
$125 million for goodwill impairment related to the sensor
business that was divested in 2005 and $31 million for
IPR&D charges related to acquisitions.

The 2003 effective tax rate reflected a $61 million benefit
from the reversal of previously-accrued income taxes as the
result of settlements reached with taxing authorities and
$32 million of IPR&D charges related to acquisitions in
2003.

Earnings from Continuing Operations

The Company had earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes of $3.3 billion in 2004, compared to earnings
from continuing operations before income taxes of
$1.4 billion in 2003. After taxes, the Company had earnings
from continuing operations of $2.2 billion, or
$0.90 per diluted share from continuing operations, in
2004, compared to earnings from continuing operations of
$928 million, or $0.39 per diluted share from
continuing operations, in 2003.

The $1.9 billion increase in earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes is primarily attributed to:
(i) a $2.9 billion increase in gross margin, primarily
due to the $8.2 billion increase in total net sales, as
well as cost savings from improved supply-chain execution,
overall cost structure improvements and ongoing cost reduction
activities, and (ii) a $95 million decrease in net
interest expense, driven primarily by the reduction in total
debt in 2004. These improvements in earnings were partially
offset by: (i) a $429 million increase in SG&A
expenditures, primarily driven by increases in: (a) sales
commissions resulting from the increase in net sales,
(b) advertising and promotions expenditures in Mobile
Devices, and (c) marketing expenditures, (ii) a
$433 million increase in R&D expenditures, due
primarily to an increase in developmental engineering
expenditures in Mobile Devices due to additional investment in
new product development, and increased investment in new
technologies by Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions,
(iii) a $130 million increase in Other charges,
primarily due to charges of $125 million for the impairment
of goodwill related to the sensor business that was divested in
2005 and $34 million in IPR&D charges related to 2004
acquisitions, and (iv) a $79 million decrease in gains
on sales of investments and businesses.

Reorganization of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
“Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
and employment grade level in the event that employment is
involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in

-force or
restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in

-force has
qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and,
therefore, such benefits are accounted for in accordance with
Statement No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits” (“SFAS 112”). Under the provisions
of SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefits
based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time
that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably
estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a
restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs
primarily consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated
facilities. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its
accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure
the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances,
accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in
carrying out the plans or because employees previously
identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not
receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not
foreseen when the original plans were initiated. The Company
reverses accruals through the income statement line item where
the original charges were recorded when it is determined they
are no longer required.

The Company realized cost-saving benefits of approximately
$34 million in 2005 from the plans that were initiated
during 2005, representing $16 million of savings in Costs
of sales, $7 million of savings in research and development
(“R&D”) expenditures, and $11 million of
savings in Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expenditures. Beyond 2005, the Company
expects the reorganization plans initiated during 2005 to
provide annualized cost savings of approximately
$172 million, representing $97 million of savings in
Cost of sales, $27 million of savings in R&D
expenditures, and $48 million of savings in SG&A
expenditures.

2005 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
initiated various productivity improvement plans aimed
principally at improving manufacturing and distribution
efficiencies and reducing costs in its integrated

supply-chain

organization, as well as reducing other operating expenses. The
Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of
$106 million, including $40 million of charges in
Costs of sales and $66 million of charges under Other
charges in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. Included in the aggregate $106 million are
charges of $102 million for employee separation costs,
$15 million for fixed asset adjustments and $5 million
for exit costs, partially offset by $16 million of
reversals for accruals no longer needed. Total employees
impacted by these actions are 2,625.

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs— Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$84 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2005 additional charges of $5 million
were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Government
and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The 2005 adjustments
of $7 million represent reversals of $1 million for
accruals no longer needed and $6 million of translation
adjustments. The $27 million used in 2005 reflects cash
payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of $55 million,
which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$46 million for employee separation costs, representing the
severance costs for approximately 500 employees, of which 50
were direct employees and 450 were indirect employees. The 2005
additional charges of $102 million represent costs for an
additional 2,625 employees, of which 1,350 were direct employees
and 1,275 were indirect employees. The adjustments of
$16 million represent reversals of accruals no longer
needed.

During 2005, approximately 1,500 employees, of which 300 were
direct employees and 1,200 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $79 million used in 2005
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $53 million, which is included in
Accrued Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2005, is expected to be paid to
approximately 1,600 employees to be separated in 2006.

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs— Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$143 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2004 adjustments of $21 million represent
reversals of $32 million for accruals no longer needed,
partially offset by an $11 million translation adjustment.
The $38 million used in 2004 reflects cash payments to
lessors. The remaining accrual of $84 million, which is
included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$116 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 2,100 employees, of which
1,000 were direct employees and 1,100 were indirect employees.
The 2004 additional charges of $59 million represented the
severance costs for approximately 900 employees, of which 100
were direct employees and 800 were indirect employees. The
adjustments of $34 million represent reversals of accruals
no longer needed.

During 2004, approximately 2,500 employees, of which 1,000 were
direct employees and 1,500 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $95 million used in 2004
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $46 million, was included in Accrued
liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2004.

2003 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company
recorded net reorganization of business charges of
$39 million, including $16 million of charges in Costs
of sales and $23 million of charges under Other charges in
the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
Included in the aggregate $39 million are charges of
$212 million, partially offset by $173 million of
reversals for accruals no longer needed. The charges primarily
consisted of: (i) $85 million in the Mobile Devices

activities in Flensburg, Germany and the closure of an
engineering center in Boynton Beach, Florida,
(ii) $50 million in the Government and Enterprise
Mobility Solutions segment for

segment-wide

employee
separation costs, and (iii) $39 million in General
Corporate, primarily for the impairment of assets classified as

held-for-sale

and
employee separation costs. The $212 million of charges were
partially offset by reversals of previous accruals of
$173 million, consisting of: (i) $125 million
relating to unused accruals of

previously-expected

employee separation costs across all segments,
(ii) $28 million, primarily for assets that the
Company intended to use that were previously classified as

held-for-sale,

and
(iii) $20 million for exit cost accruals no longer
required across all segments.

separation costs from January 1, 2003 to December 31,
2003:

(1)

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs— Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2003, the Company had an accrual of
$209 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2003 additional charges of $11 million
were primarily related to the exit of certain manufacturing
activities in Germany by the Mobile Devices segment. The 2003
adjustments of $20 million represent reversals for accruals
no longer needed. The $57 million used in 2003 reflects
cash payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of
$143 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2003, represents future cash payments for
lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2003, the Company had an accrual of
$336 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 5,700 employees, of which
2,000 were direct employees and 3,700 were indirect employees.
The 2003 additional charges of $163 million represented the
severance costs for approximately 3,200 employees, of which
1,200 were direct employees and 2,000 were indirect employees.
The adjustments of $125 million represent the severance
costs for approximately 1,600 employees previously identified
for separation



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

who resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or
were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the
original plans were approved.

During 2003, approximately 5,200 employees, of which 2,000 were
direct employees and 3,200 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $258 million used in 2003
reflects $254 million of cash payments to these separated
employees and $4 million of non-cash utilization. The
remaining accrual of $116 million was included in Accrued
liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are
impacted by four key components: (i) current cash and cash
equivalents, (ii) operating activities,
(iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing
activities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

During 2005, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents (which
are highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less) increased by $928 million to
$3.8 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to
$2.8 billion at December 31, 2004. At
December 31, 2005, $169 million of this amount was
held in the U.S. and $3.6 billion was held by the Company
or its subsidiaries in other countries.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act provided for
a special one-time tax incentive for U.S. multinationals to
repatriate accumulated earnings from their foreign subsidiaries
by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain
qualifying dividends. During 2005, the Company repatriated
approximately $4.6 billion of accumulated foreign earnings
and recorded an associated net income tax benefit of
$265 million. The net income tax benefit included a
$303 million tax benefit relating to the repatriation under
the Act, offset by a $38 million tax charge for the
reassessment of the Company’s cash position and related tax
liability associated with the remaining foreign undistributed
earnings. Repatriation of additional funds held outside the
U.S. could be subject to delay and could have potential
adverse tax consequences.

Reclassification of Sigma Funds:

The Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries invest most of their excess cash in
two funds (the “Sigma Funds”), which are funds similar
to a money market fund. Until the first quarter of 2005, the
Sigma Funds marketable securities balances were classified
together with other money-market type cash investments as cash
and cash equivalents. In the first quarter of 2005, to provide
enhanced disclosure, the Company reclassified the Sigma Funds
investments out of cash and cash equivalents and into a separate
statement line entitled Sigma Funds as described below in
“Investing Activities.” The Sigma Funds balance was
$10.9 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to
$7.7 billion at December 31, 2004. At
December 31, 2005, $8.7 billion of the Sigma Funds
investments were held in the U.S. and $2.2 billion were
held by the Company or its subsidiaries in other countries.

Operating Activities

The Company has generated positive cash flow from continuing
operations in each of the last 5 years. The cash provided
by operating activities from continuing operations in 2005 was
$4.6 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in 2004 and
$2.0 billion in 2003. The primary contributors to cash flow
from operations in 2005 were: (i) earnings from continuing
operations (adjusted for non-cash items) of $4.6 billion,
of which $500 million was received for the settlement of
financial and legal claims against Telsim, (ii) a
$2.3 billion increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities and (iii) a $23 million decrease in
inventories. These positive contributors to operating cash flow
were partially offset by: (i) a $1.3 billion increase
in accounts receivable, (ii) a $703 million increase
in other current assets, and (iii) $371 million
increase in other assets and other liabilities.

Accounts Receivable:

The Company’s net accounts
receivable were $5.8 billion at December 31, 2005,
compared to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2004. The
Company’s days sales outstanding (“DSO”),
including net long-term receivables, were 50 days at
December 31, 2005, compared to 46 days at
December 31, 2004. The Company’s businesses sell their
products in a variety of markets throughout the world. Payment
terms can vary by market type and geographic location.
Accordingly, the Company’s levels of accounts receivable
and DSO can be impacted by the timing and level of sales that
are made by its various businesses and by the geographic
locations in which those sales are made.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Inventory:

The Company’s net inventory was
$2.5 billion at both December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004. The Company’s inventory turns
increased to 11.3 at December 31, 2005, compared to 9.3 at
December 31, 2004. Inventory turns were calculated using an
annualized rolling three months of cost of sales method. The
increase in overall inventory turns was driven by an increase in
turns by Mobile Devices, primarily due to the significant growth
in net sales and effective inventory management programs, and is
evidence of benefits from the continued focus on inventory and
supply-chain management processes throughout the Company.
Inventory management continues to be an area of focus as the
Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels
to ensure competitive delivery performance to its customers
against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly
changing technology and customer spending requirements.

Reorganization of Businesses:

The Company has implemented
reorganization of businesses plans. Cash payments for exit costs
and employee separations in connection with these plans were
$106 million in 2005, as compared to $133 million in
2004. Of the $108 million reorganization of businesses
accrual at December 31, 2005, $53 million relates to
employee separation costs and is expected to be paid in 2006.
The remaining $55 million in accruals relate to lease
termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a
number of years.

Benefit Plan Contributions:

The Company contributed
$370 million to its pension plans during 2005, compared to
$652 million in 2004. The Company expects to make cash
contributions of approximately $275 million to its
U.S. pension plans and $44 million to its
non-U.S. pension plans during 2006. The Company contributed
$43 million to its retiree healthcare plan in 2005 and
expects to contribute $45 million to this plan in 2006.
Retirement-related benefits are further discussed below in the
“Significant Accounting Policies— Retirement-Related
Benefits” section.

Investing Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s investing
activities include: (i) proceeds from sales of investments
and businesses, (ii) purchases of Sigma Funds investments,
(iii) strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, other
companies, and (iv) capital expenditures.

Net cash used for investing activities from continuing
operations was $2.4 billion in 2005, as compared to net
cash used of $1.7 billion in 2004 and $6.1 billion in
2003. The $699 million increase in cash used for investing
activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to: (i) a
$1.6 billion increase in cash used for the purchase of
Sigma Funds investments, (ii) an $89 million increase
in capital expenditures, and (iii) a $35 million
decrease in proceeds received from the disposition of property,
plant and equipment, partially offset by: (i) an
$875 million increase in proceeds from the sales of
investments and businesses, (ii) a $164 million
decrease in cash used for acquisitions and investments, and
(iii) a $21 million increase in proceeds from the sale
of short-term investments. The $6.1 billion in cash used
for investing activities from continuing operations in 2003 was
primarily due to the initial purchase of Sigma Funds investments.

Sales of Investments and Businesses:

The Company received
$1.6 billion in proceeds from the sales of investments and
businesses in 2005, compared to proceeds of $682 million in
2004 and $665 million in 2003. The $1.6 billion in
proceeds in 2005 were primarily comprised of:
(i) $679 million from the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel Communications, Inc.
(“Nextel”) during the first half of 2005,
(ii) $391 million from the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Sprint Nextel Corporation during the
fourth quarter of 2005, (iii) $232 million from the
sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Semiconductor
Manufacturing International Corporation, and
(iv) $96 million received in connection with the
merger of Sprint Corporation and Nextel. The $682 million
in proceeds generated in 2004 were primarily comprised of:
(i) $216 million from the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation,
(ii) $141 million from the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel, (iii) $117 million
from the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Telus
Corporation, and (iv) $77 million from the sale of a
portion of the Company’s shares in Nextel Partners, Inc.
(“Nextel Partners”).

Sigma Funds:

The Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries invest most of their excess cash in two funds (the
“Sigma Funds”), which are funds similar to a money
market fund. The Company used $3.2 billion in net cash for
the purchase of Sigma Funds investments in 2005, compared to
$1.5 billion in net cash for the purchase of Sigma Funds
investments in 2004. The Sigma Funds balance was
$10.9 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to
$7.7 billion at December 31, 2004.

The Sigma Funds portfolios are managed by five major outside
investment management firms and include investments in high
quality (rated at least A/ A-1 by S&P or A2/ P-1 by
Moody’s at purchase date), U.S. dollar-



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

denominated debt obligations including certificates of deposit,
bankers’ acceptances and fixed time deposits, government
obligations, asset-backed securities and commercial paper or
short-term corporate obligations. The Sigma Funds investment
policies require that floating rate instruments acquired must
have a maturity at purchase date that does not exceed thirty-six
months with an interest rate reset at least annually. The
average maturity of the investments held by the funds must be
120 days or less with the actual average maturity of the
investments being 74 days and 64 days at December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Certain
investments with maturities beyond one year have been classified
as short-term based on their highly-liquid nature and because
such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that
is available for current operations.

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:

The Company used
cash for acquisitions and new investment activities of
$312 million in 2005, compared to cash used of
$476 million in 2004 and $279 million in 2003. The
largest components of the $312 million in 2005 expenditures
were: (i) the acquisition of the remaining interest of MIRS
Communications Israel LTD. by the Government and Enterprise
Mobility Solutions segment, (ii) the acquisition of
Wireless Valley Communications, Inc. by the Government and
Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment, (iii) the
acquisition of certain IP assets and R&D workforce from
Sendo by the Mobile Devices segment, (iv) the acquisition
of Ucentric Systems, Inc. by the Connected Home Solutions
segment, and (v) the funding of joint ventures formed by
Motorola and Comcast that will focus on developing the
next-generation of conditional access technologies. The largest
components of the $476 million in 2004 expenditures were:
(i) $169 million for the acquisition of MeshNetworks,
Inc., a leading developer of mobile mesh networking and
position-location technologies by the Government and Enterprise
Mobility Solutions segment, (ii) $121 million, net of
cash assumed, the acquisition of Force Computers by the Networks
segment, (iii) the acquisition of Quantum Bridge
Communications, Inc. by the Networks segment, and (iv) the
acquisition of the remaining interest of Appeal Telecom of Korea
by the Mobile Devices segment.

Capital Expenditures:

Capital expenditures were
$583 million in 2005, compared to $494 million in 2004
and $344 million in 2003. The increase in capital
expenditures is primarily due to: (i) increased corporate
spending on facility and asset upgrades, and (ii) increased
spending in the Mobile Devices segment. The Company’s
emphasis in making capital expenditures is to focus on strategic
investments driven by customer demand and new design capability.

Short-Term Investments:

At December 31, 2005, the
Company had $144 million in short-term investments (which
are highly-liquid fixed-income investments with an original
maturity greater than three months but less than one year),
compared to $152 million of short-term investments at
December 31, 2004.

Available-For-Sale Securities:

In addition to available
cash and cash equivalents, Sigma Funds and short-term
investments, the Company views its available-for-sale securities
as an additional source of liquidity. The majority of these
securities represent investments in technology companies and,
accordingly, the fair market values of these securities are
subject to substantial price volatility. In addition, the
realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
other conditions. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s
available-for-sale securities portfolio had an approximate fair
market value of $1.2 billion, which represented a cost
basis of $1.1 billion and a net unrealized gain of
$157 million. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s
available-for-sale securities portfolio had an approximate fair
market value of $2.9 billion, which represented a cost
basis of $616 million and a net unrealized gain of
$2.3 billion.

Nextel Investment:

During the first half of 2005, the
Company sold 22.5 million shares of common stock of Nextel
Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”). The Company received
approximately $679 million in cash and realized a pre-tax
gain of $609 million from these sales. Subsequent to these
sales, the Company owned 25 million shares of common stock
and 29.7 million shares of non-voting common stock of
Nextel.

On August 12, 2005, Sprint Corporation completed its merger
(the “Sprint Nextel Merger”) with Nextel. In
connection with the Sprint Nextel Merger, Motorola received
$46 million in cash, 31.7 million voting shares and
37.6 million non-voting shares of Sprint Nextel Corporation
(“Sprint Nextel”), in exchange for its remaining
54.7 million shares of Nextel. As a result of this
transaction, the Company realized a gain of $1.3 billion,
comprised of a $1.7 billion gain recognized on the receipt
of cash and the 69.3 million shares of Sprint Nextel in
exchange for its shares of Nextel, net of a $418 million
loss recognized on its hedge of 25 million shares of common
stock of Nextel, as described below.

On December 14, 2004, in connection with the announcement
of the definitive agreement relating to the Sprint Nextel
Merger, Motorola, a Motorola subsidiary and Nextel entered into
an agreement pursuant to which Motorola and its subsidiary
agreed not dispose of their 29.7 million non-voting shares
of Nextel (now 37.6 million



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

shares of non-voting common stock of Sprint Nextel issued in
exchange for Nextel non-voting common stock pursuant to the
Sprint Nextel Merger) for a period of no longer than two years.
In exchange for this agreement, Nextel paid Motorola a fee of
$50 million in the third quarter 2005.

In March 2003, the Company entered into agreements with multiple
investment banks to hedge up to 25 million of its voting
shares of Nextel common stock over periods of three, four and
five years, respectively. Although the precise number of shares
of Nextel common stock the Company was required to deliver to
satisfy the contracts was dependent upon the price of Nextel
common stock on the various settlement dates, the maximum
aggregate number of shares was 25 million and the minimum
number of shares was 18.5 million. Prior to August 12,
2005, changes in the fair value of these variable share forward
purchase agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) were
recorded in Non-owner changes to equity included in Stockholders
equity. As a result of the Sprint Nextel Merger, the Company
realized the cumulative $418 million loss relating to the
Variable Forwards that had previously been recorded in
Stockholder’s equity. In addition, the Variable Forwards
were adjusted to reflect the underlying economics of the Sprint
Nextel Merger. The Company did not designate the adjusted
Variable Forwards as a hedge of the Sprint Nextel shares
received as a result of the merger. Accordingly, the Company
recorded $51 million of gains reflecting the change in
value of the Variable Forwards from August 12, 2005 through
the settlement of the Variable Forwards with the counterparties
during the fourth quarter of 2005.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company elected to settle
the Variable Forwards by delivering 30.3 million shares of
Sprint Nextel common stock, with a value of $725 million,
to the counterparties and selling the remaining 1.4 million
Sprint Nextel common shares in the open market. The Company
received aggregate cash proceeds of $391 million and
realized a loss of $70 million in connection with the
settlement and sale.

Total gains recognized in 2005 related to its investment in
Nextel and Sprint Nextel as described above were approximately
$1.8 billion included in Gains on sales of investments and
businesses in Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations plus $51 million of
gains related to the Variable Forwards included in Other in
Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statement of operations.

Financing Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s financing
activities are: (i) net proceeds from (or repayment of)
commercial paper and short-term borrowings, (ii) net
proceeds from (or repayment of) long-term debt securities,
(iii) the payment of dividends, (iv) proceeds from the
issuances of stock due to the exercise of employee stock options
and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, and
(v) the purchase of the Company’s common stock under
its share repurchase program.

Net cash used for financing activities was $1.2 billion in
2005, compared to $237 million of cash used in 2004 and
$757 million of cash used in 2003. Cash used for financing
activities in 2005 was primarily: (i) $1.1 billion of
cash used to repay debt, (ii) $874 million of cash
used for the purchase of the Company’s common stock under
the share repurchase program, and (iii) $394 million
of cash used to pay dividends, partially offset by proceeds of
$1.2 billion received from the issuance of common stock in
connection with the Company’s employee stock option plans
and employee stock purchase plan.

Cash used for financing activities in 2004 was primarily
attributable to: (i) $2.3 billion to repay debt
(including commercial paper), (ii) $500 million to
redeem all outstanding Trust Originated Preferred
Securities

sm

(the “TOPrS”), and (iii) $378 million to pay
dividends, partially offset by: (i) $1.7 billion in
proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in
connection with the Company’s employee stock option plans
and employee stock purchase plan, and
(ii) $1.3 billion in distributions from discontinued
operations.

Short-term Debt:

At December 31, 2005, the
Company’s outstanding notes payable and current portion of
long-term debt was $448 million, compared to
$717 million at December 31, 2004. In the fourth
quarter of 2004, $398 million of 6.5% Debentures due
2025 (the “2025 Debentures”) were reclassified to
current maturities of long-term debt, as the holders of the
debentures had the right to put their debentures back to the
Company on September 1, 2005. $1 million of the 2025
Debentures were submitted for redemption on September 1,
with the remaining put options expiring unexercised. The
remaining $397 million of 2025 Debentures were reclassified
back to long-term debt in the third quarter of 2005. In
addition, the remaining $118 million of 7.6% Notes due
January 1, 2007 (the “2007 Notes”) were
reclassified to current maturities of long-term debt.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net cash proceeds from the sale of commercial paper and
short-term borrowings were $11 million in 2005, compared to
net cash used of $19 million in 2004. The Company had
$300 million of outstanding commercial paper on both
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

Long-term Debt:

At December 31, 2005, the Company
had outstanding long-term debt of $3.8 billion, compared to
$4.6 billion at December 31, 2004. The change can be
primarily attributed to: (i) the repurchase of
$1.0 billion principal amount of long-term debt in 2005,
(ii) the reclassification of the $397 million of
outstanding 2025 Debentures back to long-term debt as described
above, and (iii) the reclassification of the
$118 million of outstanding 2007 Notes from long-term debt
to current maturities of long-term debt as described above. The
Company used $1.1 billion to repurchase an aggregate
principal amount of $1.0 billion of long-term debt in 2005,
compared to net cash used of $2.8 billion in 2004 to retire
an aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion of debt and
$500 million of
TOPrS.

sm

Although the Company believes that it can continue to access the
capital markets in 2006 on acceptable terms and conditions, its
flexibility with regard to short-term and long-term financing
activity could be limited by: (i) the Company’s
current levels of outstanding long-term debt, and (ii) the
Company’s credit ratings. In addition, many of the factors
that affect the Company’s ability to access the capital
markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets
and the current state of the economy, in particular the
telecommunications industry, are outside of the Company’s
control. There can be no assurances that the Company will
continue to have access to the capital markets on favorable
terms.

Redemptions and Repurchases of Outstanding Debt
Securities:

In August 2005, the Company commenced cash
tender offers for up to $1.0 billion of certain of its
outstanding long-term debt. The tender offers expired on
September 28, 2005 and the Company repurchased an aggregate
principal amount of $1.0 billion of its outstanding
long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of
$1.1 billion. Included in the $1.0 billion of
long-term debt repurchased were repurchases of a principal
amount of: (i) $86 million of the $200 million of
6.50% Notes due 2008 outstanding,
(ii) $241 million of the $325 million of
5.80% Notes due 2008 outstanding, and
(iii) $673 million of the $1.2 billion of
7.625% Notes due 2010 outstanding. In addition, the Company
terminated a notional amount of $1.0 billion

fixed-to

-floating
interest rate swaps associated with the debt repurchased,
resulting in an expense of approximately $22 million. The
aggregate charge for the repurchase of the debt and the
termination of the associated interest rate swaps, as presented
in Other income (expense), was $137 million.

On September 1, 2005, the Company retired $1 million
of the $398 million of the 2025 Debentures in connection
with the holders of the debentures right to put their debentures
back to the Company. The residual put options expired
unexercised and the remaining $397 million of 2025
Debentures were reclassified back to long-term debt.

In 2004, the Company: (i) repaid, at maturity, all
$500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of
6.75% Debentures due 2004, (ii) repurchased a
principal amount of $110 million of the $409 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
6.50% Debentures due 2028, (iii) repurchased a
principal amount of $182 million of the $300 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 7.6% Notes
due 2007, (iv) redeemed all $1.4 billion aggregate
principal amount outstanding of its 6.75% Notes due 2006,
and (v) redeemed all outstanding Liquid Yield Option Notes
due September 7, 2009 and all outstanding Liquid Yield
Option Notes due September 27, 2013 for an aggregate
redemption price of approximately $4 million. In addition,
Motorola Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business
trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, redeemed all
outstanding Trust Originated Preferred
Securities

sm

(“TOPrS”) for an aggregate redemption price of
$500 million, plus accrued interest. Also, pursuant to the
terms of the 7.00% Equity Security Units (the “MEUs”),
the $1.2 billion of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2007 (the
“2007 MEU Notes”) that comprised a portion of the MEUs
were remarketed to a new set of holders. In connection with the
remarketing, the interest rate on the 2007 MEU Notes was reset
to 4.608%. Additionally, in November 2004, pursuant to the terms
of the MEUs, the Company sold 69.4 million shares of common
stock to the holders of the MEUs. The purchase price per share
was $17.30 resulting in aggregate proceeds of $1.2 billion.

Given the Company’s cash position, it may from time to time
seek to opportunistically retire certain of its outstanding debt
through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated
transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend
on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
Subject to these factors, the Company has announced a goal to
further reduce its total debt by an additional $1.0 billion
during 2006.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Share Repurchase Program:

On May 18, 2005, the
Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the
Company to purchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding
common stock over a

36-month

period ending
on May 31, 2008, subject to market conditions. During 2005,
the Company has paid $874 million to
repurchase 41.7 million shares at an average price of
$20.94 per share; all shares repurchased have been retired.

Credit Ratings:

Three independent credit rating agencies,
Fitch Investors Service (“Fitch”), Moody’s
Investor Services (“Moody’s”), and
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), assign
ratings to the Company’s short-term and long-term debt. The
following chart reflects the current ratings assigned to the
Company’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term
debt and the Company’s commercial paper by each of these
agencies.

In June 2005, Moody’s upgraded the Company’s long-term
debt rating to “Baa2” with a “stable”
outlook from “Baa3” with a “positive”
outlook. Moody’s also upgraded the Company’s
short-term debt rating to

“P-2”

from

“P-3”.

In May
2005, S&P upgraded the Company’s long-term debt rating
to “BBB+” with a “stable” outlook from
“BBB” with a “positive” outlook. There was
no change in the short-term rating of

“A-2”.

In
January 2005, Fitch upgraded the Company’s long-term debt
rating to “BBB+” with a “positive” outlook
from “BBB” with a “positive” outlook. There
was no change in the short-term rating of

“F-2”.

The Company’s debt ratings are considered “investment
grade.” If the Company’s senior long-term debt were
rated lower than “BBB-” by S&P or Fitch or
“Baa3” by Moody’s (which would be a decline of
two levels from current Moody’s ratings), the
Company’s long-term debt would no longer be considered
“investment grade.” If this were to occur, the terms
on which the Company could borrow money would become more
onerous. The Company would also have to pay higher fees related
to its domestic revolving credit facility. The Company has never
borrowed under its domestic revolving credit facilities.

The Company continues to have access to the commercial paper and
long-term debt markets. However, the Company generally has had
to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money than it would have
if its credit ratings were higher. The Company has maintained
commercial paper balances of between $300 million and
$500 million for the past four years. This reflects the
fact that the market for commercial paper rated

“A-2/

P-2/

F-2”

is smaller
than that for commercial paper rated

“A-1/

P-1/

F-1”

and
commercial paper or other short-term borrowings may be of
limited availability to participants in the

“A-2/

P-2/

F-2”

market from

time-to

-time or for
extended periods.

As further described under “Customer Financing
Arrangements” below, for many years the Company has
utilized a number of receivables programs to sell a
broadly-diversified group of short-term receivables to third
parties. Certain of the short-term receivables are sold to a
multi-seller commercial paper conduit. This program provides for
up to $300 million of short-term receivables to be
outstanding with the conduit at any time. The obligations of the
conduit to continue to purchase receivables under this
short-term receivables program could be terminated if the
Company’s long-term debt was rated lower than
“BB+” by S&P or “Ba1” by Moody’s
(which would be a decline of three levels from the current
Moody’s rating). If this short-term receivables program
were terminated, the Company would no longer be able to sell its
short-term receivables to the conduit in this manner, but it
would not have to repurchase previously-sold receivables.

Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s total domestic and

non-U.S.

credit
facilities totaled $2.9 billion, of which $95 million
was considered utilized. These facilities are principally
comprised of: (i) a $1.0 billion three-year revolving
domestic credit facility maturing in May 2007 (the

“3-Year

Credit
Facility”) which is not utilized, and
(ii) $1.9 billion of

non-U.S.

credit
facilities (of which $95 million was considered utilized at
December 31, 2005). Unused availability under the existing
credit facilities, together with available cash, cash
equivalents, Sigma Funds balances and other sources of
liquidity, are generally available to support outstanding
commercial paper, which was $300 million at
December 31, 2005.

In order to borrow funds under the

3-Year

Credit Facility,
the Company must be in compliance with various conditions,
covenants and representations contained in the agreements.
Important terms of the

3-Year

Facility include covenants relating to net interest coverage and

-book
capitalization ratios. The Company was in compliance with the
terms of the

3-Year

Credit Facility at December 31, 2005. The Company has never
borrowed under its domestic revolving credit facilities.
Utilization of the non-U.S. credit facilities may also be
dependent on the Company’s ability to meet certain
conditions at the time a borrowing is requested.

Contractual Obligations, Guarantees, and Other Purchase
Commitments

Contractual Obligations

Summarized in the table below are the Company’s obligations
and commitments to make future payments under debt obligations
(assuming earliest possible exercise of put rights by holders),
lease payment obligations, and purchase obligations as of
December 31, 2005.

(1)

Amounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments.

Debt Obligations:

At December 31, 2005, the
Company’s long-term debt obligations, including current
maturities and unamortized discount and issue costs, totaled
$4.0 billion, as compared to $5.0 billion at
December 31, 2004. A table of all outstanding long-term
debt securities can be found in Note 4, “Debt and
Credit Facilities,” to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. As previously discussed, the decrease in
the long-term debt obligations as compared to December 31,
2004, was due to the redemptions and repurchases of
$1.0 billion principal amount of outstanding securities
during 2005. Also, as previously discussed, the remaining
$118 million of 7.6% Notes due January 1, 2007 were
reclassified to current maturities of

long-term

debt.

Lease Obligations:

The Company owns most of its major
facilities, but does lease certain office, factory and warehouse
space, land, and information technology and other equipment
under principally non-cancelable operating leases. At
December 31, 2005, future minimum lease obligations, net of
minimum sublease rentals, totaled $1.2 billion. Rental
expense, net of sublease income, was $254 million in 2005,
$217 million in 2004 and $223 million in 2003.

Purchase Obligations:

The Company has entered into
agreements for the purchase of inventory, license of software,
promotional agreements, and research and development agreements
which are firm commitments and are not cancelable. The longest
of these agreements extends through 2015. Total payments
expected to be made under these agreements total
$992 million.

Commitments Under Other Long-Term Agreements:

The Company
has entered into certain long-term agreements to purchase
software, components, supplies and materials from suppliers.
Most of the agreements extend for periods of one to three years
(three to five years for software). However, generally these
agreements do not obligate the Company to make any purchases,
and many permit the Company to terminate the agreement with
advance notice (usually ranging from 60 to 180 days). If
the Company were to terminate these agreements, it generally
would be liable for certain termination charges, typically based
on work performed and supplier on-hand inventory and raw
materials attributable to canceled orders. The Company’s
liability would only arise in the event it terminates the
agreements for reasons other than “cause.”

In 2003, the Company entered into outsourcing contracts for
certain corporate functions, such as benefit administration and
information technology related services. These contracts
generally extend for 10 years and are expected to expire in
2013. The total payments under these contracts are approximately
$3 billion over 10 years; however, these contracts can
be terminated. Termination would result in a penalty
substantially less than the annual contract payments. The
Company would also be required to find another source for these
services, including the possibility of performing them in-house.

As is customary in bidding for and completing network
infrastructure projects and pursuant to a practice the Company
has followed for many years, the Company has a number of
performance/bid bonds and standby letters of credit outstanding,
primarily relating to projects of Government and Enterprise
Mobility Solutions segment and the Networks segment. These
instruments normally have maturities of up to three years and
are standard in the



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

industry as a way to give customers a convenient mechanism to
seek resolution if a contractor does not satisfy performance
requirements under a contract. A customer can draw on the
instrument only if the Company does not fulfill all terms of a
project contract. If such an occasion occurred, the Company
would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that
issued the bond or letter of credit for the amounts paid. The
Company is not generally required to post any cash in connection
with the issuance of these bonds or letters of credit. In its
long history, it has been extraordinarily uncommon for the
Company to have a performance/bid bond or standby letter of
credit drawn upon. At December 31, 2005, outstanding
performance/bid bonds and standby letters of credit totaled
approximately $1.1 billion, compared to $1.0 billion
at the end of 2004.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

Under the definition
contained in Item 303(a)(4) (ii) of
Regulation

S-K,

the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Adequate Internal and External Funding Resources:

The
Company believes that it has adequate internal and external
resources available to fund expected working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for the next twelve months as supported
by the level of cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Funds in the
U.S., the ability to repatriate cash, cash equivalents and Sigma
Funds from foreign jurisdictions, the ability to borrow under
existing or future credit facilities, the ability to issue
commercial paper, access to the short-term and long-term debt
markets, and proceeds from sales of available-for-sale
securities and other investments.

Customer Financing Commitments and Guarantees

Outstanding Commitments:

Certain purchasers of the
Company’s infrastructure equipment continue to request that
suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment
purchases. Financing may include all or a portion of the
purchase price of the equipment as well as working capital.
Periodically, the Company makes commitments to provide financing
to purchasers in connection with the sale of equipment. However,
the Company’s obligation to provide financing is often
conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of
the Company by a reputable bank to support the purchaser’s
credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to
purchase the receivable from the Company. The Company had
outstanding commitments to extend credit to third-parties
totaling $689 million at December 31, 2005, compared
to $294 million at December 31, 2004. Of these
amounts, $594 million was supported by letters of credit or
by bank commitments to purchase receivables at December 31,
2005, compared to $162 million at December 31, 2004.

Guarantees of Third-Party Debt:

In addition to providing
direct financing to certain equipment customers, the Company
also assists customers in obtaining financing directly from
banks and other sources to fund equipment purchases. The Company
had committed to provide financial guarantees relating to
customer financing totaling $115 million and
$78 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively (including $66 million and
$70 million, respectively, relating to the sale of
short-term receivables). Customer financing guarantees
outstanding were $71 million and $29 million at
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively
(including $42 million and $25 million, respectively,
relating to the sale of short-term receivables).

Customer Financing Arrangements

Outstanding Finance Receivables:

The Company had net
finance receivables of $260 million at December 31,
2005, compared to $170 million at December 31, 2004
(net of allowances for losses of $12 million at
December 31, 2005 and $2.0 billion at
December 31, 2004). These finance receivables are generally
interest bearing, with rates ranging from 3% to 10%. Interest
income recognized on finance receivables for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $7 million,
$9 million and $18 million, respectively.

Telsim Loan:

On October 28, 2005, the Company
announced that it settled the Company’s and its
subsidiaries’ financial and legal claims against Telsim
Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. (“Telsim”). The
Government of Turkey and the Turkish Savings and Deposit
Insurance Fund (“TMSF”) are

third-party

beneficiaries of the settlement agreement. In settlement of its
claims, the Company received $500 million in cash and the
right to receive 20% of any proceeds in excess of
$2.5 billion from any sale of Telsim. On December 13, 2005,
Vodafone agreed to purchase Telsim for $4.55 billion, pursuant
to a sales process organized by the TMSF. This purchase has not
yet been completed. Accordingly, Motorola expects to receive an
additional cash payment of $410 million upon the completion
of the sale. Although there can be no assurances as to when or
if the sale will close, the Company currently expects to receive
the $410 million in the second quarter of 2006. The gross
receivable outstanding from Telsim was zero at December 31,
2005. The Company is permitted to, and will continue to, enforce
its U.S. court judgment against the Uzan family, except in
Turkey and three other countries. As a result of



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

difficulties in collecting the amounts due from Telsim, the
Company had previously recorded charges reducing the net
receivable from Telsim to zero. The net receivable from Telsim
has been zero since 2002.

Sales of Receivables and Loans:

From time to time, the
Company sells short-term receivables, long-term loans and lease
receivables under sales-type leases (collectively, “finance
receivables”) to third parties in transactions that qualify
as “true-sales.” Certain of these finance receivables
are sold to third parties on a one-time, non-recourse basis,
while others are sold to third parties under committed
facilities that involve contractual commitments from these
parties to purchase qualifying receivables up to an outstanding
monetary limit. Committed facilities may be revolving in nature.
Certain sales may be made through separate legal entities that
are also consolidated by the Company. The Company may or may not
retain the obligation to service the sold finance receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2005, these committed
facilities provided for up to $1.1 billion to be
outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
up to $724 million provided at December 31, 2004 and
up to $598 million provided at December 31, 2003. As
of December 31, 2005, $585 million of these committed
facilities were utilized, compared to $305 million utilized
at December 31, 2004 and $295 million utilized at
December 31, 2003. Certain events could cause one of these
facilities to terminate. In addition, before receivables can be
sold under certain of the committed facilities they may need to
meet contractual requirements, such as credit quality or
insurability.

Total finance receivables sold by the Company were
$4.5 billion in 2005 (including $4.2 billion of
short-term receivables), compared to $3.8 billion sold in
2004 (including $3.8 billion of short-term receivables) and
$2.8 billion sold in 2003 (including $2.7 billion of
short-term receivables). As of December 31, 2005, there
were $1.0 billion of receivables outstanding under these
programs for which the Company retained servicing obligations
(including $838 million of short-term receivables),
compared to $720 million outstanding at December 31,
2004 (including $589 of short-term receivables) and
$557 million outstanding at December 31, 2003
(including $378 of short-term receivables).

Under certain of the receivables programs, the value of the
receivables sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from
independent insurance companies, less deductibles or
self-insurance requirements under the policies (with the Company
retaining credit exposure for the remaining portion). The
Company’s total credit exposure to outstanding short-term
receivables that have been sold was $66 million at
December 31, 2005 as compared to $25 million at
December 31, 2004. Reserves of $4 million were
recorded for potential losses on sold receivables at both
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

Other Contingencies

Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying
Contract Value:

In certain circumstances, our businesses may
enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the
damages that could be claimed by the other party for failed
performance might exceed the revenue the Company receives from
the contract. Contracts with these sorts of uncapped damage
provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still
represent meaningful risk. Although it has not previously
happened to the Company, there is a possibility that a damage
claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result
in expenses to the Company that are far in excess of the revenue
received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.

Legal Matters:

The Company has several lawsuits filed
against it relating to the Iridium program, as further described
under “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” of this
document. The Company has not reserved for any potential
liability that may arise as a result of litigation related to
the Iridium program. While the still pending cases are in
preliminary stages and the outcomes are not predictable, an
unfavorable outcome of one or more of these cases could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

The Company is a defendant in various other lawsuits, including
product-related suits, and is subject to various claims which
arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of
management, and other than discussed above with respect to the
still pending Iridium cases, the ultimate disposition of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Segment Information

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the
financial results of each reporting segment as detailed in
Note 10, “Information by Segment and Geographic
Region,” to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. Net sales and operating results for the
Company’s four operating segments for 2005, 2004 and 2003
are presented below.

Mobile Devices Segment

The

Mobile Devices

segment designs, manufactures, sells
and services wireless handsets, with integrated software and
accessory products. In 2005, Mobile Devices’ net sales
represented 58% of the Company’s consolidated net sales,
compared to 55% in 2004 and 49% in 2003.

Segment Results— 2005 Compared to 2004

In 2005, the segment’s net sales increased 25% to
$21.5 billion, compared to $17.1 billion in 2004. This
25% increase in net sales was driven by a 40% increase in unit
shipments in 2005, reflecting strong consumer demand for GSM
handsets and consumers’ desire for the segment’s
compelling products that combine innovative style and leading
technology. The segment had increased net sales in all regions
as a result of an improved product portfolio, strong market
growth in emerging markets and high replacement sales in more
mature markets.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$2.2 billion in 2005, compared to operating earnings of
$1.7 billion in 2004. The 27% increase in operating
earnings was primarily related to an increase in gross margin,
driven by the 25% increase in net sales. The improvements in
operating results were partially offset by: (i) an increase
in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expenses, reflecting increased advertising and promotion
expenditures to support higher sales and brand awareness, and
(ii) an increase in total research and development
(“R&D”) expenditures, as a result of increased
investment in new product development. The segment’s
industry typically experiences short life cycles for new
products. Therefore, it is vital to the segment’s success
that new, compelling products are constantly introduced.
Accordingly, a strong commitment to R&D is required to fuel
long-term growth.

The segment’s backlog was $3.0 billion at
December 31, 2005, compared to $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2004. During the year, the segment had strong
order growth and backlog increased due to: (i) high levels
of customer demand for new products during the fourth quarter,
certain of which were unable to be shipped in significant
quantities due to supply constraints for select components, and
(ii) the segment’s higher level of general order input
in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of
2004.

Unit shipments increased by 40% to 146.0 million in 2005,
compared to 104.5 million in 2004. The increase in unit
shipments was attributed to a 17% increase in the size of the
total worldwide handset market and a gain in the segment’s
market share. The gain in market share was attributed to broad
acceptance of the segment’s product offering, particularly
a strong demand for GSM handsets. For the full year 2005, unit
shipments by the segment increased in all regions.

In 2005, average sales price (“ASP”) decreased
approximately 10% compared to 2004. The overall decrease in ASP
was driven primarily by a higher percentage of lower-tier,
lower-priced handsets in the overall sales mix. By comparison,
ASP increased approximately 15% in 2004 and declined 8% in 2003.
ASP is impacted by numerous factors, including product mix,
market conditions and competitive product offerings, and ASP
trends often vary over time.

A few customers represent a significant portion of the
segment’s net sales. During 2005, purchases of
iDEN

®

products by Sprint Nextel Corporation and its affiliates
(“Sprint Nextel”) comprised approximately 11% of the
segment’s net sales. On August 12, 2005, Sprint
Corporation and Nextel Communications, Inc. completed their
merger transaction (the “Sprint Nextel Merger”) that
was announced in December 2004. The combined company, Sprint
Nextel, is the segment’s largest customer and Motorola has
been its sole supplier of iDEN handsets and core



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

iDEN

®

network infrastructure equipment for over ten years. Sprint
Nextel uses Motorola’s proprietary iDEN technology to
support its nationwide wireless service business. Motorola is
currently operating under supply agreements for iDEN handsets
and infrastructure equipment that cover the period from
January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The segment
did not experience any significant impact to its business in
2005 as a result of the Sprint Nextel Merger.

The largest of the segment’s end customers (including sales
through distributors) are Sprint Nextel, Cingular, China Mobile,
América Móvil and

T-Mobile.

Besides
selling directly to carriers and operators, Mobile Devices also
sells products through a variety of third-party distributors and
retailers, which account for approximately 36% of the
segment’s net sales. The largest of these distributors,
Brightstar Corporation, is our primary distributor in Latin
America. The loss of any of the segment’s key customers
could have a significant impact on the segment’s business.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
60% of our segment’s total net sales, are outside the
U.S. The largest of these international markets are China,
the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany and Mexico.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 52% to
$17.1 billion, compared to $11.2 billion in 2003. This
52% increase in net sales was driven by increases in both unit
shipments and ASP compared to 2003, and reflected strong
consumer demand for new products. The strong demand for these
new handsets was reflected by increased net sales in all regions.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$1.7 billion in 2004, compared to operating earnings of
$511 million in 2003. The 238% increase in operating
earnings was primarily related to an increase in gross margin,
which was driven by: (i) the 52% increase in net sales, and
(ii) a decrease in reorganization of business charges,
primarily due to: (a) charges recorded in 2003 for employee
severance and exit costs, which were primarily related to the
exit of certain manufacturing activities in Flensburg, Germany,
and (b) reversals of accruals recorded in 2004 that were
related to accruals for exit costs and employee severance which
were no longer needed. These improvements to operating results
were partially offset by: (i) an increase in SG&A
expenditures, reflecting increased advertising, promotion and
marketing expenditures to support higher sales and brand
awareness, and (ii) an increase in R&D expenditures,
primarily reflecting increased developmental engineering
expenditures due to additional investment in new product
development.

The segment’s backlog was $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. The decline in backlog was driven
primarily by the segment’s improved ability to meet demand
for new products in a more timely manner. In addition, the
backlog at December 31, 2003 was unusually high due to the
impact of a key component supply constraint that resulted in the
segment’s inability to meet the demand for certain new
products in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Unit shipments increased by 39% to 104.5 million in 2004,
compared to 75.3 million in 2003. The overall increase was
driven by increased unit shipments in all regions.
Correspondingly, the segment’s market share was estimated
to have increased in 2004 compared to 2003.

Also contributing to the increase in net sales in 2004 was an
improvement in the segment’s ASP, which increased
approximately 15% in 2004 compared to 2003. The overall increase
in ASP was driven primarily by a shift in product mix during
2004 towards higher-tier handsets. By comparison, ASP declined
approximately 8% in 2003 and 5% in 2002.

The largest of the segment’s end customers (including sales
through distributors) were Sprint Nextel, Cingular, China Mobile
and Vodafone. During 2004, purchases of
iDEN

®

products by Sprint Nextel comprised approximately 14% of the
segment’s net sales. Besides selling directly to carriers
and operators, the segment also sold products through a variety
of third-party distributors and retailers, which accounted for
approximately 30% of the segment’s net sales. The largest
of these distributors, Brightstar Corporation, and was our
primary distributor in Latin America.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
largest market, sales into

non-U.S.

markets
represented approximately 60% of the segment’s total net
sales in 2004, compared to 52% in 2003. The largest of these
international markets in 2004 were China, the United Kingdom and
Brazil. In North America, the industry saw consolidation of some
major telecommunications carriers in 2004, involving some of the
segment’s largest



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

customers. However, the segment did not see any significant
impact on their business in 2004 due to these consolidations.

Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions Segment

The

Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions

segment
designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and
digital two-way radio, voice and data communications products
and systems to a wide range of public-safety, government,
utility, transportation and other worldwide markets, and
participates in the market for integrated information
management, mobile and biometric applications and services. The
segment also designs, manufactures and sells automotive
electronics systems, as well as telematics systems that enable
communication and advanced safety features for automobiles. In
2005, the segment net sales represented 18% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales, compared to 20% in 2004
and 24% in 2003.

Segment Results—2005 Compared to 2004

In 2005, the segment’s net sales increased 6% to
$6.6 billion, compared to $6.2 billion in 2004. The
increase in net sales reflects increased sales to the
segment’s government and enterprise markets, partially
offset by a decrease in sales to the automotive electronics
market, driven primarily by weak automobile industry conditions.
The increase in net sales in the government market was driven by
increased customer spending on enhanced mission-critical
communications and the continued focus on homeland security
initiatives. The increase in net sales in the enterprise market
reflects enterprise customers’ demand for business-critical
communications. The overall increase in net sales was driven by
net sales growth in the Americas and Asia.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$882 million in 2005, compared to operating earnings of
$842 million in 2004. The 5% increase in operating earnings
was primarily due to a 6% increase in net sales. This
improvement in operating results was partially offset by:
(i) an increase in SG&A expenditures, (ii) an
increase in reorganization of business charges, primarily
relating to employee severance, and (iii) an increase in
R&D expenditures, driven by increased investment in
next-generation technologies across the segment.

Net sales in North America continue to comprise a significant
portion of the segment’s business, accounting for 69% of
the segment’s net sales in both 2005 and 2004. The
principal Automotive customers are large automobile
manufacturers, primarily in North America. Net sales to five
such customers represented approximately 20% of the
segment’s net sales in 2005. The segment’s backlog was
$2.4 billion at both December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004.

Natural disasters and terrorist-related worldwide events in 2005
continued to place an emphasis on mission-critical
communications systems. Spending by the segment’s
government and public safety customers is affected by government
budgets at the national, state and local levels. The segment
will continue to work closely with all pertinent government
departments and agencies to ensure that two-way radio and
wireless communications is positioned as a critical need for
public safety and homeland security. As a global leader in
mission-critical communications, we expect to continue to grow
as spending increases worldwide for mission-critical
communications systems. The segment continues to be
well-positioned to serve the increased worldwide demand for
these systems in 2006 and beyond.

The scope and size of systems requested by some of the
segment’s customers continue to increase, including
requests for country-wide and statewide systems. These larger
systems are more complex and include a wide range of
capabilities. Large-system projects will impact how contracts
are bid, which companies compete for bids and how companies
partner on projects.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 12% to
$6.2 billion, compared to $5.6 billion in 2003. The
increase in net sales reflected: (i) continued emphasis on
spending by customers in the segment’s government market on



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

enhanced mission-critical communications and the continued focus
on homeland security initiatives, (ii) increased spending
by the segment’s enterprise customers on business-critical
communications needs, and (iii) an increase in
automative-related sales. The overall increase in net sales
reflected net sales growth in all regions.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$842 million in 2004, compared to operating earnings of
$663 million in 2003. The 27% increase in operating
earnings was primarily due to: (i) the 12% increase in net
sales, (ii) cost savings from supply-chain efficiencies,
and (iii) overall cost structure improvements. Also
contributing to the increase in operating earnings was a
decrease in reorganization of business charges, primarily due to
a decrease in charges related to segment-wide employee
severance. These improvements in operating results were
partially offset by: (i) an increase in R&D
expenditures driven by increased investment in new technologies,
(ii) an increase in SG&A expenditures, primarily due to
an increase in selling and sales support expenditures, resulting
from the 12% increase in net sales, and
(iii) $17 million of in-process research and
development charges related to the acquisitions of MeshNetworks,
Inc. (“MeshNetworks”) and CRISNET, Inc.
(“CRISNET”)

Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant
portion of the segment’s business, accounting for 67% of
the segment’s net sales in both 2004 and 2003. The
segment’s backlog was $2.4 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $2.0 billion at
December 31, 2003. The increase in backlog at the end of
2004 was driven by the awarding of large, multi-year projects in
the segment’s government market during the latter half of
2004.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company completed the
acquisitions of MeshNetworks and CRISNET. MeshNetworks is a
leading developer of mobile mesh networking and
position-location technologies. CRISNET has a suite of advanced
software applications for law enforcement, justice and public
safety agencies.

Networks Segment

The

Networks

segment designs, manufactures, sells,
installs and services: (i) cellular infrastructure systems,
including hardware and software,
(ii)

fiber-to

-the-premise
(“FTTP”) and

fiber-to

-the-node
(“FTTN”) transmission systems supporting high-speed
data, video and voice, and (iii) wireless broadband
systems. In addition, the segment designs, manufactures, and
sells embedded communications computing platforms. In 2005, the
segment’s net sales represented 17% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales compared to 19% in 2004 and 21% in 2003.

Segment Results— 2005 Compared to 2004

In 2005, the segment’s net sales increased 5% to
$6.3 billion, compared to $6.0 billion in 2004. The 5%
increase in sales was driven by increased customer purchases of
cellular infrastructure equipment, as well as increased sales of
wireless broadband systems and embedded computing communications
systems. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in the
Europe, Middle East and Africa region (“EMEA”) and
North America, which offset lower sales in Asia and Latin
America. Sales into

non-U.S.

markets
represented approximately 58% of the segment’s total net
sales in 2005, compared to approximately 66% in 2004. The
segment’s backlog was $2.0 billion at both
December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$990 million in 2005, compared to operating earnings of
$718 million in 2004. The 38% increase in operating
earnings was primarily related to an increase in gross margin,
which was due to: (i) the 5% increase in net sales, and
(ii) improvements in cost structure. These improvements in
operating results were partially offset by an increase in
SG&A expenditures, primarily due to increased selling and
sales support expenditures, as a result of the 5% increase in
net sales. R&D expenditures also increased compared to 2004,
due to additional investment in the growth businesses of
wireless broadband systems and passive optical networks.

The cellular infrastructure industry experienced its second
straight year of growth in 2005, with estimated worldwide
industry growth of 10%. The segment’s 5% increase in net
sales was reflective of the overall sales growth in the
industry, yet resulted in a slight loss of market share for the
segment in 2005.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The nature of the segment’s business is long-term contracts
with major operators that require sizeable investments by its
customers. In 2005, five customers— Sprint Nextel; KDDI;
China Mobile; Verizon; and China Unicom— represented
approximately 53% of the segment’s net sales. The loss of
one of these major customers could have a significant impact on
the segment’s business and, because contracts are long-term
in nature, could impact revenue and earnings over several
quarters.

On August 12, 2005, Sprint Corporation and Nextel
Communications, Inc. completed their merger transaction (the
“Sprint Nextel Merger”) that was announced in December
2004. The combined company, Sprint Nextel, is the segment’s
largest customer, representing 23% of the segment’s net
sales in 2005. Motorola has been Sprint Nextel’s sole
supplier of
iDEN

®

handsets and core iDEN network infrastructure equipment for over
ten years. Sprint Nextel uses Motorola’s proprietary iDEN
technology to support its nationwide wireless service business.
Motorola is currently operating under supply agreements for iDEN
handsets and infrastructure equipment that cover the period from
January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The segment
did not experience any significant impact to its business in
2005 as a result of the Sprint Nextel Merger.

We also continue to build on our industry-leading position in
push-to-talk over cellular (“PoC”) technology. We have
executed agreements to launch our PoC product application on
both GSM and CDMA2000 networks. The Networks business deployed
PoC technology for 44 wireless carriers in
33 countries and territories in 2005. In addition, the
Networks segment has begun executing on its seamless mobility
strategy with major contract wins in PON and Wireless Broadband.
In 2005, we announced an agreement with Verizon to supply FTTP
access equipment and related services enabling their triple play
offering (voice, data and video). We also signed a contract with
Earthlink to deliver equipment and services enabling them to
become a Metro WiFi broadband provider in Philadelphia, Anaheim
and other cities.

Segment Results—2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 24% to
$6.0 billion, compared to $4.8 billion in 2003. The
24% increase in net sales in 2004 was driven by an increase in
spending by the segment’s wireless service provider
customers and reflects increased net sales in both the
segment’s mature and emerging markets. Net sales growth
occurred in all technologies and in all regions. Sales into

non-U.S.

markets
represented approximately 66% of the segment’s total net
sales in 2004, compared to approximately 63% in 2003. The
segment’s backlog was $2.0 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared to $1.7 billion at
December 31, 2003.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$718 million in 2004, compared to operating earnings of
$148 million in 2003. The 385% increase in operating
earnings was primarily related to an increase in gross margin,
which was due to: (i) the 24% increase in net sales, and
(ii) continued cost containment in the segment’s
supply chain. These improvements in operating results were
partially offset by: (i) an increase in SG&A
expenditures, primarily due to increased selling and sales
support expenditures, as a result of the 24% increase in net
sales, and (ii) an increase in R&D expenditures in 2004
compared to 2003.

The wireless infrastructure industry experienced significant
growth in 2004 after three years of decline. The segment
believes that the 24% increase in net sales outpaced overall
sales growth in the industry, and resulted in increased market
share for the segment in 2004.

In 2004, five customers—China Mobile; China Unicom; KDDI;
Sprint Nextel; and Verizon—represented approximately 54% of
the segment’s net sales. Sprint Nextel was the
segment’s largest customer in 2004, representing 20% of the
segment’s net sales.

In May 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Quantum
Bridge, a leading provider of fiber-to-the-premise
(“FTTP”) solutions. The acquisition complements
Motorola’s existing multiservice technology, enabling the
Company to offer a full-service access platform that broadband
network operators can deploy to deliver the next generation of
advanced services. The Quantum Bridge business became a part of
the Networks segment in 2005 as part of the realignment of the
segments that was effective January 1, 2005.

Connected Home Solutions Segment

The

Connected Home Solutions

segment designs,
manufactures and sells a wide variety of broadband products,
including: (i) digital systems and set-top boxes for cable
television, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and
broadcast networks, (ii) high speed data products,
including cable modems and cable modem termination systems
(“CMTS”) and IP-based telephony products,
(iii) hybrid fiber coaxial network transmission systems
used by cable television

operators, (iv) digital satellite program distribution
systems,
(v)

direct-to

-home
(“DTH”) satellite networks and private networks for
business communications, and (vi) advanced video
communications products. In 2005, the segment’s net sales
represented 8% of the Company’s consolidated net sales,
compared to 7% in 2004 and 8% in 2003.

Segment Results— 2005 Compared to 2004

In 2005, the segment’s net sales increased 25% to
$2.8 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in 2004. The
increase in overall net sales was driven by increases in both
ASP and unit shipments of digital set-top boxes. Net sales
increased in North America, Latin America and Asia, partially
offset by a slight decrease in net sales in EMEA. Net sales in
North America continue to comprise a significant portion of the
segment’s business, accounting for 84% of the
segment’s total net sales in 2005, compared to 83% in 2004.
The segment’s backlog was $424 million at
December 31, 2005, compared to $305 million at
December 31, 2004.

The segment generated operating earnings of $185 million in
2005, compared to $146 million in 2004. The improvement in
operating results was primarily due to the 25% increase in net
sales, partially offset by increased product costs due to
increased sales of higher-end products, mainly HD/DVR set-top
boxes. Although HD/ DVR set-top boxes carry a higher ASP, the
higher costs on the HD/DVR set-top box line caused gross margin
as a percentage of sales to decrease in 2005, compared to 2004.
R&D and SG&A expenditures increased in total, but
decreased as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to the
increase in net sales.

In 2005, net sales of digital set-top boxes increased 34%, due
to increases in both ASP and unit shipments. The increase in ASP
was driven by a product-mix shift towards higher-end products,
particularly HD/ DVR set-top boxes. The increase in unit
shipments was primarily due to the increased spending by cable
operators. The segment continued to be the worldwide leader in
market share for digital cable set-top boxes.

In 2005, net sales of cable modems increased 9%. The increase in
net sales was due to an increase in cable modem unit shipments,
which was partially offset by the decline in ASP for cable
modems. The decrease in ASP was primarily due to increased
competition. The segment retained its leading worldwide market
share in cable modems.

Demand for the segment’s products depends primarily on the
level of capital spending by broadband operators for
constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their communications
systems and services. After a number of years of decreased
capital spending, in 2004 and 2005 our cable operator customers
increased their purchases of the segment’s products and
services, primarily due to increased demand for advanced digital
set-top boxes to provide HD/ DVR functionality.

The segment is dependent upon a small number of customers for a
significant portion of its sales. Because of continuing
consolidation within the cable industry, a small number of large
cable television multiple system operators (“MSOs”)
own a large portion of the cable systems and account for a
significant portion of the total capital spending. In 2005, net
sales to the segment’s top five customers represented 53%
of the segment’s total net sales. Net sales to the
segment’s largest customer, Comcast, accounted for 31% of
the total net sales of the segment. The loss of business from
any major MSO could have a significant impact on the
segment’s business.

During the first quarter of 2005, Motorola and Comcast entered
into a broader strategic relationship that includes an agreement
for a multi-year set-top box commitment. This agreement extended
Comcast and Motorola’s agreement for Comcast to purchase
set-top boxes and network equipment, including HD/ DVR and
standard-definition entry-level set-top box models. As part of
this strategic relationship, Motorola and Comcast also formed
two joint ventures that will focus on developing and licensing
the next generation of conditional access technologies.

On February 24, 2006, the segment completed the acquisition
of Kreatel Communications AB (“Kreatel”), a leading
developer of innovative IP based digital

set-top

boxes. IPTV, or
the video component of the triple play, is expected to be the
primary focus for telecommunication companies around the world
as it offers a significant competitive tool versus cable
operators. The segment plans to integrate Kreatel’s

set-top

boxes into its
current suite

of digital systems and

set-top

boxes for cable
television, IP video and broadcast networks, enabling the
segment to offer a full range of connected home solutions which
enable customers to be seamlessly connected, informed and
entertained.

Segment Results— 2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, the segment’s net sales increased 27% to
$2.2 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in 2003. The
increase in overall net sales was primarily due to:
(i) increased purchases of digital cable set-top boxes by
cable operators, (ii) an increase in ASP due to a mix shift
in digital set-top boxes towards higher-end products, and
(iii) an increase in retail sales. The increase in net
sales reflects net sales growth in all regions, primarily in
North America. Net sales in North America continued to comprise
a significant portion of the segment’s business, accounting
for 83% of the segment’s total net sales in 2004, compared
to 85% in 2003. The segment’s backlog was $305 million
at December 31, 2004, compared to $288 million at
December 31, 2003.

The segment generated operating earnings of $146 million in
2004, compared to operating earnings of $48 million in
2003. The improvement in operating results was due to:
(i) an increase in gross margin, which was driven by the
27% increase in net sales, (ii) a $73 million charge
for impairment of goodwill related to the infrastructure
business that occurred in 2003, and (iii) a decrease in
SG&A expenditures. The decrease in SG&A expenditures was
primarily due to: (i) a decrease in intangible
amortization, and (ii) a decrease in administrative
expenses due to benefits from prior cost-reduction actions.
Although gross margin increased, the segment’s gross margin
as a percentage of net sales decreased, primarily due to sales
of new higher-tier products carrying lower initial margins,
which is typical in the early phases of the segment’s
product life cycles.

In 2004, net sales of digital set-top boxes increased 29%, due
to increases in both ASP and unit shipments. The increase in ASP
was driven by a product-mix shift towards higher-end products,
particularly HD/ DVR set-top boxes. The increase in unit
shipments was primarily due to the increased spending by cable
operators. The segment continued to be the worldwide leader in
market share for digital cable set-top boxes.

In 2004, net sales of cable modems increased 20%. The increase
in net sales was due to an increase in cable modem unit
shipments, which was partially offset by the decline in ASP for
cable modems. The decrease in ASP was primarily due to increased
competition. The segment retained its leading worldwide market
share in cable modems.

The segment was dependent upon a small number of customers for a
significant portion of its sales in 2004. Because of continuing
consolidation within the cable industry, a small number of MSOs
own a large portion of the cable systems and account for a
significant portion of the total capital spending. In 2004, net
sales to the segment’s top five customers represented 47%
of the segment’s total net sales. Net sales to the
segment’s largest customer, Comcast, accounted for 30% of
the total net sales of the segment in 2004.

Significant Accounting Policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations discuss the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current economic and industry conditions and on
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following significant accounting
policies require significant judgment and estimates:

— Revenue recognition

— Allowance for losses on finance receivables

— Inventory valuation reserves

— Deferred tax asset valuation



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

— Valuation of investments and long-lived assets

— Restructuring activities

— Retirement-related benefits

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s arrangements with customers may differ in
nature and complexity and may contain multiple deliverables
including products, equipment, services and software that may be
essential to the functionality of the other deliverables, which
requires the Company to make judgments and estimates in
recognizing revenues.

Product and equipment sales may contain discounts, price
protection, return provisions and other customer incentives. The
Company’s recorded revenues are reduced by allowances for
these items at the time the sales are recorded. The allowances
are based on management’s best estimate of the amount of
allowances that the customer will ultimately earn and is based
on historical experience taking into account the type of
products sold, the type of customer and the type of transaction
specific to each arrangement.

The Company’s long-term contracts involve the design,
engineering, manufacturing and installation of wireless networks
and two-way radio voice and data systems. These systems are
designed to meet specific customer requirements and
specifications and generally require extended periods to
complete. If the Company can reliably estimate revenues and
contract costs and the technology is considered proven, revenue
is recognized under the percentage of completion method as work
progresses towards completion. Estimates of contract revenues,
contract costs and progress towards completion are based on
estimates that consider historical experience and other factors
believed to be relevant under the circumstances. Management
regularly reviews these estimates and considers the impact of
recurring business risks and uncertainties inherent in the
contracts, such as system performance and implementation delays
due to factors within or outside the control of management.

Generally, multiple element arrangements are separated into
specific accounting units when delivered elements have value to
the customer on a stand-alone basis, objective and reliable
evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element(s),
and delivery of the undelivered element(s) is probable and
substantially within the control of the Company. Total
arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate
accounting units based on their relative fair values (if the
fair value of each accounting unit is known) or using the
residual method (if the fair value of the undelivered element(s)
is known). Revenue is recognized for a separate accounting unit
when the revenue recognition criteria are met for that unit. In
certain situations, judgment is required in determining both the
number of accounting units and fair value of the elements,
although generally the fair value of an element can be
objectively determined if the Company sells the element on a
stand alone basis.

Changes in these estimates could negatively impact the
Company’s operating results. In addition, unforeseen
conditions could arise over the contract term that may have a
significant impact on the operating results. It is reasonably
likely that different operating results would be reported if the
Company used other acceptable revenue recognition methodologies,
such as the completed-contract method, or applied different
assumptions.

Allowance for Losses on Finance Receivables

The Company has historically provided financing to certain
customers in connection with purchases of the Company’s
infrastructure equipment where the contractual terms of the note
agreements are greater than one year. Financing provided has
included all or a portion of the equipment purchase price, as
well as working capital for certain purchasers.

Gross financing receivables were $272 million at
December 31, 2005 and $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2004, with an allowance for losses on these
receivables of $12 million and $2.0 billion,
respectively. Of the receivables at December 31, 2005,
$10 million (zero net of allowances for losses of
$10 million) were considered impaired based on
management’s determination that the Company will be unable
to collect all amounts in accordance with the contractual terms
of the relevant agreement. By comparison, impaired receivables
at December 31, 2004 were $2.0 billion
($7 million, net of allowance for losses of
$2.0 billion).

Management periodically reviews customer account activity in
order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for
potential losses. Factors considered include economic
conditions, collateral values and each customer’s payment
history and credit worthiness. Adjustments, if any, are made to
reserve balances following the completion



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

of these reviews to reflect management’s best estimate of
potential losses. The resulting net finance receivable balance
is intended to represent the estimated realizable value as
determined based on: (i) the fair value of the underlying
collateral, if the receivable is collateralized, or
(ii) the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the
underlying receivable.

Inventory Valuation Reserves

The Company records valuation reserves on its inventory for
estimated obsolescence or unmarketability. The amount of the
reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the
inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis,
management in each segment performs an analysis of the
underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and
obsolescence and, for the remaining inventory, assesses the net
realizable value. Management uses its best judgment to estimate
appropriate reserves based on this analysis.

Inventories consisted of the following:

$

$

2,546

The Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory
levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its
customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to
rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As
indicated above, the Company’s inventory reserves
represented 18% of the gross inventory balance at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. These reserve levels are
maintained by the Company to provide for unique circumstances
facing our businesses. The Company has inventory reserves for
pending cancellations of product lines due to technology
changes, long-life cycle products, lifetime buys at the end of
supplier production runs, business exits, and a shift of
production to outsourcing.

If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory
writedowns may be required. Likewise, as with other reserves
based on management’s judgment, if the reserve is no longer
needed, amounts are reversed into income. There were no
significant reversals into income of this type in 2005 or 2004.

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based
on the differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company
regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and
establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable
income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of
the reversals of existing temporary differences and the
implementation of tax-planning strategies. If the Company is
unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain
tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the
actual effective tax rates or time period within which the
underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible,
the Company could be required to increase its valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in an
increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on
operating results.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s deferred
tax assets related to tax carryforwards were $2.1 billion
and $2.2 billion, respectively. The tax carryforwards are
comprised of net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax
credit and other tax credit carryovers for both U.S. and

non-U.S.

subsidiaries.
A majority of the net operating losses and other tax credits can
be carried forward for 20 years. The carryforward period
for foreign tax credits was extended to ten years, from five
years, during 2004 with the enactment of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances totaling
$896 million and $892 million as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, for certain state credits and state
tax loss carryforwards with carryforward periods of seven years
or less, tax loss carryforwards of acquired entities that are
subject to limitations and tax loss



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

carryforwards and other deferred tax assets of certain

non-U.S.

subsidiaries.
The Company believes that the deferred tax assets for the
remaining tax carryforwards are considered more likely than not
to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and
the implementation of tax planning strategies.

Valuation of Investments and Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of investments and
long-lived assets, which includes identifiable intangible
assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that
could trigger an impairment review include:
(i) underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results; (ii) changes in the
manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall
business; (iii) negative industry or economic trends;
(iv) declines in stock price of an investment for a
sustained period; and (v) our market capitalization
relative to net book value.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
intangible assets, goodwill and long-lived assets may not be
recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded. Impairment is
generally measured based on a projected discounted cash flow
method using a discount rate determined by our management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
model or prevailing market rates of investment securities, if
available.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net book values of these
assets were as follows (in millions):

December 31



Property, plant and equipment

2,271

$

2,332

3,241

Intangible assets



Goodwill

1,349

1,283

$

$

7,089

The Company recorded fixed asset impairment charges of
$15 million in 2005, compared to no charges in 2004 and
charges of $10 million in 2003. The 2003 charges primarily
related to certain information technology equipment that was
deemed to be impaired.

The Company recorded impairment charges related to its
investment portfolio of $25 million, $36 million and
$96 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
representing other-than-temporary declines in the value of the
Company’s investment portfolio. The impairment charges in
2005 and 2004 are primarily related to

cost-based

investment

write-downs.

The
$96 million impairment charge in 2003 was primarily
comprised of a $29 million charge to write down to zero the
Company’s debt security holding in a European cable
operator and other cost-based investment writedowns.
Additionally, the available-for-sale securities portfolio
reflected a net pre-tax unrealized gain position of
$157 million and $2.3 billion at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company performs a goodwill impairment test at the reporting
unit level at least annually as of October, or more often should
triggering events occur. In determining the fair value of the
reporting unit, the Company utilizes independent appraisal firms
who employ a combination of present value techniques and quoted
market prices of comparable businesses. No impairment charges
were required in 2005. During 2004, the Company determined that
goodwill related to a sensor business, which was subsequently
divested in 2005, was impaired by $125 million. During
2003, the Company determined that the goodwill at the
infrastructure reporting unit of the Connected Home Solutions
segment was impaired by $73 million.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of future
impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might
have on these reported asset values. Such events may include
strategic decisions made in response to the economic conditions
relative to product lines or operations and the impact of the
economic environment on our customer base.

Restructuring Activities

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
“Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
and employment grade level in the event that employment is
involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in

-force or
restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in

-force has
qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and,
therefore, such



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

benefits are accounted for in accordance with Statement
No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment Benefits”
(“SFAS 112”). Under the provisions of
SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefits based
on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that
future settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated
based on estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is
approved by management. Exit costs primarily consist of future
minimum lease payments on vacated facilities.

At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its accruals for
exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure the accruals
are still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no
longer required because of efficiencies in carrying out the
plans or because employees previously identified for separation
resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were
redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original
plans were initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the
income statement line item where the original charges were
recorded when it is determined they are no longer required.

Retirement-Related Benefits

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
“Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. The Company
also provides defined benefit plans to some of its foreign
entities (the

“Non-U.S.

Plans”).

The Company also has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
elected officers. The Officers’ Plan contains provisions
for funding the participants’ expected retirement benefits
when the participants meet the minimum age and years of service
requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the
Officers’ Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option
to remain in the Officers’ Plan or elect to have their
benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective
December 31, 1999, no new elected officers were eligible to
participate in the Officers’ Plan. Effective June 30,
2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
(“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits in
excess of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code
on the Regular Pension Plan. All

newly-elected

officers
are participants in MSPP. Elected officers covered under the
Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP.

Certain healthcare benefits are available to eligible domestic
employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
termination of employment (the “Postretirement Healthcare
Benefits Plan”). For eligible employees hired prior to
January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Healthcare Benefits
Plan has been closed to new participants.

The Company accounts for its pension benefits and its
postretirement health care benefits using actuarial models
required by SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions,” respectively. These models use an
attribution approach that generally spreads individual events
over the service lives of the employees in the plan. Examples of
“events” are plan amendments and changes in actuarial
assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases. The
principle underlying the required attribution approach is that
employees render service over their service lives on a
relatively consistent basis and, therefore, the income statement
effects of pension benefits or postretirement health care
benefits are earned in, and should be expensed in, the same
pattern.

There are various assumptions used in calculating the net
periodic benefit expense and related benefit obligations. One of
these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets. The required use of expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income
that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan
assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected
long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual
long-term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income
and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of
the services provided by the employees. Differences between
actual and expected returns are recognized in the net periodic
pension calculation over five years.

The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience
with consideration of the expected investment mix of the
plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term
investment returns to develop its expected rate of return
assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost and
the net retirement healthcare expense. The



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Company’s investment return assumption for the Regular
Pension Plan and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan was
8.50% in both 2005 and 2004. The investment return assumption
for the Officers’ Plan was 6.00% in both 2005 and 2004. At
December 31, 2005, the Regular Pension Plan investment
portfolio was predominantly equity investments and the
Officers’ Plan investment portfolio was predominantly
fixed-income securities.

A second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate
assumptions used for pension benefits and postretirement health
care benefits accounting reflects, at December 31 of each
year, the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income
debt instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the
measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows
to pay the benefit obligation when due. The Company’s
discount rate for measuring the pension obligations was 6.00%
both at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The
Company’s discount rate for measuring the retirement
healthcare obligation was 5.75% at December 31, 2005,
compared to 6.00% at December 31, 2004.

A final set of assumptions involves the cost drivers of the
underlying benefits. The rate of compensation increase is a key
assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting
and is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans
for such increases. In both 2005 and 2004, the Company’s
rate for future compensation increase was 4.00% for non-officer
employees. The Company’s 2005 rate for future compensation
increase for the Officers’ Plan was 0% as salaries have
been frozen for this plan. The Company’s 2004 rate for
future compensation increase for the Officers’ Plan was
3.00%. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for health care
costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. Based on
this review, the health care cost trend rate used to determine
the December 31, 2005 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 10% for 2006 with a declining trend rate of 1%
each year until it reaches 5% by 2011, with a flat 5% rate for
2011 and beyond.

Negative financial market returns during 2000 through 2002
resulted in a decline in the fair-market value of plan assets.
This, when combined with declining discount rate assumptions in
the last several years, has resulted in a decline in the funded
status of the Company’s domestic and certain

non-U.S.

plans.
Consequently, the Company’s accumulated benefit obligation
for various plans exceeded the fair-market value of the plan
assets for these plans at December 31, 2005. The Company
recorded a non-cash, after-tax, net charge of $208 million
to equity relating to the Regular Pension Plan, the
Officers’ Plan, and certain

non-U.S.

subsidiaries
retirement programs in the fourth quarter of 2005. This charge
was included in Non-owner changes to equity in the consolidated
balance sheets, and did not impact the Company’s pension
expense, earnings or cash contribution requirements in 2005.

For the Regular Pension Plan, the Company currently estimates
2006 expenses for continuing operations will be approximately
$230 million. The 2005 and 2004 actual expenses, which
include discontinued operations, were $177 million and
$167 million, respectively. Cash contributions of
$275 million were made to the Regular Pension Plan in 2005.
The Company expects to make cash contributions of
$270 million to this plan during 2006. In addition, the
Company expects to make cash contributions of $5 million to
its Officers’ and MSPP plans, collectively, and
$44 million to its Non-U.S. Plans in 2006.

For the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan, the Company
currently estimates 2006 expenses for continuing operations will
be approximately $31 million. The 2005 and 2004 actual
expenses, which include discontinued operations, were
$27 million and $39 million, respectively. The Company
has partially funded its accumulated benefit obligation of
$496 million with plan assets valued at $212 million
at December 31, 2005. Motorola is obligated to transfer to
Freescale Semiconductor $68 million in cash or plan assets,
as permitted by law without adverse tax consequences to
Motorola, with such transfer expected to occur in 2006, plus
investment returns earned on this amount, which was
approximately $7 million as of December 31, 2005. Cash
contributions of $43 million were made to this plan in
2005. No cash contributions were required in 2004. The Company
expects to make a cash contribution of approximately
$45 million to the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan
in 2006.

The impact on the future financial results of the Company in
relation to retirement-related benefits is dependent on economic
conditions, employee demographics, interest rates and investment
performance. The Company’s measurement date of its plan
assets and obligations is December 31. Thus, during the
fourth quarter of each year, management reviews and, if
necessary, adjusts the assumptions associated with its benefit
plans.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
(“SFAS 154”), which replaces APB Opinion
No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and FASB Statement
No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statement”. SFAS 154 retained accounting
guidance related to



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

changes in estimates, changes in a reporting entity and error
corrections; however, changes in accounting principles must be
accounted for retrospectively by modifying the financial
statements of prior periods. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe adoption of
SFAS 154 will have a material impact on our financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123R
(“SFAS 123R”), a revision to Statement
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” This standard requires the Company to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards.
The cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the
vesting period of the awards. The standard provides for a
prospective application. Under this method, the Company will
begin recognizing compensation cost for equity based
compensation for all new or modified grants after the date of
adoption. In addition, the Company will recognize the unvested
portion of the grant date fair value of awards issued prior to
adoption based on the fair values previously calculated for
disclosure purposes. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate
value of unvested options, as determined using a Black-Scholes
option valuation model, was $467 million. Upon adoption of
SFAS 123R, a majority of this amount will be recognized
over the remaining vesting period of these options. The Company
will adopt SFAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. The
Company believes that the adoption of this standard will result
in a reduction of earnings per share by $0.06 to $0.08 in 2006.
This estimate is based on many assumptions including the level
of stock option grants expected in 2006, the Company’s
stock price, and significant assumptions in the option valuation
model including volatility and the expected life of options.
Actual expenses could differ from the estimate.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” (“SFAS 151”).
SFAS 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage, be charged to
expense in the period they are incurred rather than capitalized
as a component of inventory costs. In addition, SFAS 151
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversions based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. The Company is required to adopt
provisions of SFAS 151, on a prospective basis, as of
January 1, 2006. The Company does not believe the adoption
of SFAS 151 will have a material impact on the future
results of operations.

Realignment of Segments Effective January 1, 2005

The Company announced its decision, effective January 1,
2005, to realign its businesses into four operating business
groups: (i) Mobile Devices, (ii) Government and
Enterprise Mobility Solutions, (iii) Networks, and
(iv) Connected Home Solutions. The historical segment
financial information presented in the filing has been
reclassified to reflect the realigned segments. The realignment
had no impact on the Company’s previously-reported
historical consolidated net sales, operating earnings(loss),
earnings(loss) from continuing operations, net earnings(loss) or
earnings(loss) per share.

Reclassification of Incentive Compensation Costs

The consolidated statements of operations include reclassified
incentive compensation costs, which were previously reported as
a component of Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expenditures, to Cost of sales and
Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
based upon the function in which the related employees operate.
The impact of this reclassification was: (i) a reduction in
Gross margin of $89 million, $143 million and
$64 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
(ii) a decrease in SG&A expenditures of
$334 million, $495 million and $244 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and (iii) an increase in
R&D expenditures of $245 million, $352 million and
$180 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
reclassification has also been reflected within the quarterly
financial information provided in Note 15. The reclassifications
did not affect Net sales, Operating earnings, Earnings from
continuing operations, Net earnings or Earnings per share.

elsewhere in this report or our other Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those stated in the forward-looking
statements.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk

Foreign Currency Risk

As a multinational company, the Company’s transactions are
denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses
financial instruments to hedge, or to reduce its overall
exposure to, the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.
The Company’s policy is not to speculate in financial
instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
trade in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures,
or enter into trades for any currency to intentionally increase
the underlying exposure. Instruments that are designated as part
of a hedging relationship must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as
a part of a hedging relationship at the inception of the
contract. Accordingly, changes in market values of hedge
instruments must be highly correlated with changes in market
values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge
and over the life of the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
is to offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments
against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
or investments based on the operating business units’
assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts
for some of the Company’s non-functional currency
receivables and payables, which are denominated in major
currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company uses
forward contracts and options to hedge these currency exposures.
In addition, the Company enters into derivative contracts for
some firm commitments and some forecasted transactions, which
are designated as part of a hedging relationship if it is
determined that the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting.
A portion of the Company’s exposure is from currencies that
are not traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the
extent reasonably possible, through managing net asset
positions, product pricing and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had net
outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
$2.8 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not
subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities
and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the
instruments which are charged to Other within Other income
(expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations. The following table shows, in millions of
U.S. dollars, the five largest net foreign exchange
derivative positions as of December 31, 2005 compared to
their respective positions at December 31, 2004:

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
obligations. However, the Company does not expect any
counterparties, all of whom which presently have high credit
ratings, to fail to meet their obligations.

Foreign exchange financial instruments that are subject to the
effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect reported
earnings, include derivative financial instruments and other
financial instruments which are not denominated in the currency
of the legal entity holding the instrument. Derivative financial
instruments consist primarily of forward contracts. Other
financial instruments, which are not denominated in the currency
of the legal entity holding the instrument, consist primarily of
cash, cash equivalents, Sigma Funds, short-term investments,
long-term finance receivables, equity investments and notes, as
well as accounts payable and receivable. Accounts payable and
receivable are reflected at fair value in the financial
statements. The fair value of the foreign exchange financial
instruments would hypothetically decrease by $192 million
as of December 31, 2005 if the foreign currency rates were
to change unfavorably by 10% of current levels. This
hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on future cash
flows under the following conditions: (i) all current
payables and receivables that are hedged were not realized,
(ii) all hedged commitments and anticipated transactions
were not realized or canceled, and (iii) hedges of these
amounts were not canceled or offset. The Company does not expect
that any of these conditions will be realized. The Company
expects that gains and losses on the derivative financial
instruments should offset gains and losses on the assets,
liabilities and future transactions being hedged. If the hedged
transactions were included in the



sensitivity analysis, the hypothetical change in fair value
would be immaterial. The foreign exchange financial instruments
are held for purposes other than trading.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company recorded income of $1.5 million,
$0.1 million and $3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of fair value hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company excluded the
change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the
changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward
price from the measure of effectiveness as these amounts are
charged to Other within Other income (expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Expense
(income) related to fair value hedges that were discontinued for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are
included in the amounts noted above.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company recorded expense (income) of $(0.5) million,
$11.9 million and $(1.5) million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company excluded the
change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the
changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward
price from the measure of effectiveness as these amounts are
charged to Other within Other income (expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Expense
(income) related to cash flow hedges that were discontinued for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are
included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, on
a pre-tax basis, expense (income) of $(21) million,
$27 million and $(1) million, respectively, was
reclassified from equity to earnings and is included in Other
within Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. If exchange rates do not change from
year-end, the Company estimates that $2 million of pre-tax
net derivative expense included in Non-owner changes to equity
within Stockholders’ equity would be reclassified into
earnings within the next twelve months and will be reclassified
in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings. The
actual amounts that will be reclassified into earnings over the
next twelve months will vary from this amount as a result of
changes in market conditions.

At December 31, 2005, the maximum term of derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was three years.
However, the weighted average duration of the Company’s
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
four months.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company did not have any
hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
foreign operations.

Investments Hedge

In March 2003, the Company entered into agreements with multiple
investment banks to hedge up to 25 million of its voting
shares of Nextel common stock over periods of three, four and
five years, respectively. Although the precise number of shares
of Nextel common stock the Company was required to deliver to
satisfy the contracts was dependent upon the price of Nextel
common stock on the various settlement dates, the maximum
aggregate number of shares was 25 million and the minimum
number of shares was 18.5 million. Prior to August 12,
2005, changes in the fair value of these variable share forward
purchase agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) were
recorded in Non-owner changes to equity included in
Stockholders’ equity. As a result of the Sprint Nextel
Merger, the Company realized the cumulative $418 million
loss relating to the Variable Forwards that had previously been
recorded in Stockholders’ equity. In addition, the Variable
Forwards purchase agreements were adjusted to reflect the
underlying economics of the Sprint Nextel Merger. The Company
did not designate the adjusted Variable Forwards as a hedge of
the Sprint Nextel shares received as a result of the merger.
Accordingly, the Company recorded $51 million of gains
reflecting the change in value of the Variable Forwards from
August 12, 2005 through the settlement of the Variable
Forwards with the counterparties during the fourth quarter of
2005.



During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company elected to settle
the Variable Forwards by delivering 30.3 million shares of
Sprint Nextel common stock, with a value of $725 million,
to the counterparties and selling the remaining 1.4 million
Sprint Nextel common shares in the open market. The Company
received aggregate cash proceeds of $391 million and
realized a loss of $70 million in connection with the
settlement and sale.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
equivalents, Sigma Funds, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt, foreign
currency contracts and other financing commitments.

Using available market information, the Company determined that
the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2005 was
$4.3 billion, compared to a carrying value of
$4.0 billion. Since considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term
debt is not necessarily indicative of the amount which could be
realized in a current market exchange.

The fair values of the other financial instruments were not
materially different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2005.

Equity Price Market Risk

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s available-for-sale
securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value of
$1.2 billion which represented a cost basis of
$1.1 billion and a net unrealized gain of
$157 million. The value of the available-for-sale
securities would change by $122 million as of year-end 2005
if the price of the stock in each of the publicly-traded
companies were to change by 10%. These equity securities are
held for purposes other than trading.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s short-term debt
consisted primarily of $300 million of commercial paper,
priced at short-term interest rates. The Company has
$4.0 billion of long-term debt, including current
maturities, which is primarily priced at long-term, fixed
interest rates.

In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
payments. During the year ended December 31, 2005, in
conjunction with the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount
of $1.0 billion of long-term debt, the Company terminated a
notional amount of $1.0 billion of these swaps that were
associated with the repurchased debt, resulting in expense of
approximately $22 million, which is included in debt
retirement costs within Other income (expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The
following table displays the interest rate swaps that were
outstanding at December 31, 2005:

The short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments on the above
interest rate swaps was 6.9% for the three months ended
December 31, 2005. The fair value of the interest rate
swaps at December 31, 2005 and 2004, was approximately
$(50) million and $3 million, respectively. The fair
value of the interest rate swaps would hypothetically decrease
by $35 million (i.e., would decrease from
$(50) million to $(85) million) if LIBOR rates



were to increase by 10% from current levels. Except for these
interest rate swaps, the Company had no outstanding commodity
derivatives, currency swaps or options relating to debt
instruments at December 31, 2005 or 2004.

The Company designated its interest rate swap agreements as part
of a fair value hedging relationship. Interest expense on the
debt is adjusted to include the payments made or received under
such hedge agreements.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
dealing with leading, creditworthy financial institutions having
long-term debt ratings of “A” or better and, does not
anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts are
distributed among several financial institutions, thus
minimizing credit risk concentration.

Environmental Matters

Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment, has no material
effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive
position of Motorola.

Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Motorola, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
dated February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and all
majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s investments in
non-controlled entities in which it has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are
accounted for by the equity method. The Company’s
investments in other entities are accounted for using the cost
method.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. In
addition to these general revenue recognition criteria, the
following specific revenue recognition policies are followed:

Products and Equipment

— For product and
equipment sales, delivery generally does not occur until the
products or equipment have been shipped, risk of loss has
transferred to the customer, and objective evidence exists that
customer acceptance provisions have been met. The Company
records revenue when allowances for discounts, price protection,
returns and customer incentives can be reliably estimated.
Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. The Company
bases its estimates on historical experience taking into
consideration the type of products sold, the type of customer,
and the type of transaction specific in each arrangement.

Long-Term Contracts

— For long-term contracts
that involve customization or modification of the Company’s
equipment or software, the Company generally recognizes revenue
using the percentage of completion method based on the
percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total
estimated costs to complete the contract. In certain instances,
when revenues or costs associated with long-term contracts
cannot be reliably estimated or the contract involves unproven
technologies or other inherent hazards, revenues and margin are
deferred until the project is complete and customer acceptance
is obtained.

Services

— Revenue for services is generally
recognized ratably over the contract term as services are
performed.

Software and Licenses

— Revenue from pre-paid
perpetual licenses is recognized at the inception of the
arrangement. Revenue from non-perpetual licenses or term
licenses is recognized ratably over the period that the licensee
uses the license. Revenue from software maintenance, technical
support and unspecified upgrades is generally recognized over
the period that these services are delivered.

Multiple Element Arrangements

— Arrangements
with customers may include multiple deliverables, including any
combination of products, equipment, services and software. If
multiple element arrangements include software or software
related elements, the Company applies the provisions of AICPA
Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, “Software
Revenue Recognition”, to determine separate units of
accounting and the amount of the arrangement fee to be allocated
to those separate units of accounting. Multiple element
arrangements that include software are separated into more than
one unit of accounting if the functionality of the delivered
element(s) is not dependent on the undelivered element(s), there
is vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of the
undelivered element(s), and general revenue recognition criteria
related to the delivered elements have been met. For all other
deliverables, elements are separated into more than one unit
accounting if the delivered element(s) have value to the
customer on a stand-alone basis, objective and reliable evidence
of fair value exists for the undelivered element(s), and
delivery of the undelivered element(s) is probable and
substantially in control of the Company. Revenue is allocated to
each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each
accounting unit or using the residual method if objective
evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered
element(s). The revenue recognition criteria described above are
applied to each separate unit of accounting. If these criteria
are not met, revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or
the last element has been delivered.

Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all highly-liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.

Sigma Funds:

The Company and its

wholly-owned

subsidiaries invest most of their excess cash in two Sigma
Reserve funds (the “Sigma Funds”), which are funds
similar to a money market fund. Until the first quarter of 2005,
the Sigma Funds marketable securities balances were classified
together with other

money-market

type cash
investments as cash and cash equivalents.

The Sigma Funds portfolios are managed by five major outside
investment management firms and include investments in high
quality (rated at least

A/A-1

by S&P or

A2/P-1

by Moody’s
at purchase date), U.S.

dollar-denominated

debt
obligations including certificates of deposit, bankers’
acceptances and fixed time deposits,



government obligations,

asset-backed

securities
and commercial paper or

short-term

corporate
obligations. The Sigma Funds investment policies require that
floating rate instruments acquired must have a maturity at
purchase date that does not exceed

thirty-six

months with
an interest rate reset at least annually. The average maturity
of the investments held by the funds must be 120 days or
less with the actual average maturity of the investments being
74 days and 64 days at December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004, respectively. The Company values
investments in the Sigma Funds using the amortized cost method,
which approximates current market value. Under this method,
securities are valued at cost when purchased and thereafter a
constant proportionate amortization of any discount or premium
is recorded until maturity of the security. Certain investments
with maturities beyond one year have been classified as

short-term

based on
their highly liquid nature and because such marketable
securities represent the investment of cash that is available
for current operations.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of
average cost (which approximates computation on a

first-in,

first-out
basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is recorded using declining-balance and
straight-line methods, based on the estimated useful lives of
the assets (buildings and building equipment, 5-40 years;
machinery and equipment, 2-12 years) and commences once the
assets are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill is not
amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least
annually as of October. Intangible assets continue to be
amortized over their respective estimated useful lives ranging
from 2 to 13 years. The Company has no intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

Long-lived assets held
and used by the Company and intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The
Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used
by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net
undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
calculated using a discounted future cash flows analysis. Assets
held for sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Investments:

Investments include, principally,
available-for-sale equity securities at fair value,

held-to

-maturity debt
securities at amortized cost, securities that are restricted for
more than one year or not publicly traded at cost, and equity
method investments. For the available-for-sale equity
securities, any unrealized holding gains and losses, net of
deferred taxes, are excluded from operating results and are
recognized as a separate component of Stockholders’ Equity
until realized. The fair values of the securities are determined
based on prevailing market prices. The Company assesses declines
in the value of individual investments to determine whether such
decline is other-than-temporary and thus the investment is
impaired. This assessment is made by considering available
evidence including changes in general market conditions,
specific industry and individual company data, the length of
time and the extent to which the market value has been less than
cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the
individual company, and the Company’s intent and ability to
hold the investment.

Deferred Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the
realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation
allowance is recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets
that are not expected to be realized based on the level of
historical taxable income, projections for future taxable income
over the periods in which the temporary differences are
deductible and allowable tax planning strategies.

Finance Receivables:

Finance receivables include trade
receivables where contractual terms of the note agreement are
greater than one year. Finance receivables are considered
impaired when management determines it is probable that the
Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
the contractual terms of the note agreement, including principal
and interest. Impaired finance receivables are valued based on
the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at
the receivable’s effective rate of interest, or the fair
value of the collateral if the receivable is collateral
dependent. Interest income and late fees on impaired finance
receivables are recognized only when payments are received.
Previously impaired finance receivables are no longer considered



impaired and are reclassified to performing when they have
performed under a work out or restructuring for four consecutive
quarters.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments:

The fair values of
financial instruments are determined based on quoted market
prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting
period. The Company’s financial instruments include cash
and cash equivalents, Sigma Funds, short-term investments,
accounts receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts
payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt,
foreign currency contracts and other financing commitments. The
fair values of these financial instruments were, with the
exception of long-term debt as disclosed in Note 4, not
materially different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Many of the Company’s
non-U.S. operations use the respective local currency as the
functional currency. These operations that do not have the
U.S. dollar as their functional currency translate assets
and liabilities at current rates of exchange in effect at the
balance sheet date and revenues and expenses using the monthly
average exchange rates in effect for the period in which the
items occur. The resulting translation increases and decreases
are included as a component of Stockholders’ Equity in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For those operations
that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
transactions denominated in the local currency are measured into
U.S. dollars using the current rates of exchange for
monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange
for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from remeasurement of
monetary assets and liabilities are included in Other income
(expense) within the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations.

Foreign Currency Transactions:

The effects of remeasuring
the non-functional currency assets or liabilities into the
functional currency, as well as gains and losses on hedges of
existing assets, or liabilities are

marked-to

-market and
the result is included within Other income (expense) in the
consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on
financial instruments that hedge firm future commitments are
deferred until such time as the underlying transactions are
recognized or recorded immediately when the transaction is no
longer expected to occur. Gains or losses on financial
instruments that do not qualify as hedges under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” are recognized immediately as income or
expense.

Earnings Per Share:

The Company calculates its basic
earnings per share based on the weighted effect of all common
shares issued and outstanding. Net income is divided by the
weighted average common shares outstanding during the period to
arrive at the basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the
weighted average number of common shares used in the basic
earnings per share calculation and the weighted average number
of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or
conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, excluding
those securities that would be anti-dilutive to the earnings per
share calculation. Both basic and diluted earnings per share
amounts are calculated for earnings from continuing operations
and loss from discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Stock Compensation Costs:

The Company measures
compensation cost for stock options and restricted stock using
the intrinsic value-based method. Compensation cost, if any, is
recorded based on the excess of the quoted market price at grant
date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
The Company has evaluated the pro forma effects of using the
fair value-based method of accounting and has presented below the



pro forma effects on both earnings from continuing operations
and on net earnings, which includes discontinued operations.

The weighted-average fair value of options granted was $5.75,
$7.74, and $3.21 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair
value of each option is estimated at the date of grant using a
modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively: dividend yields of 1.0%, 0.9% and 1.8%; expected
volatility of 35.2%, 46.8% and 46.6%; risk-free interest rate of
3.9%, 3.7% and 2.6%; and expected lives of 5 years for each
grant.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts in prior years’
financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to
conform to the 2005 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In October 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
(“SFAS 154”), which replaces APB Opinion
No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and FASB Statement
No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statement”. SFAS 154 retained accounting
guidance related to changes in estimates, changes in a reporting
entity and error corrections; however, changes in accounting
principles must be accounted for retrospectively by modifying
the financial statements of prior periods. SFAS 154 is
effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe
adoption of SFAS 154 will have a material impact on our
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123R
(“SFAS 123R”), a revision to Statement
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” This standard requires the Company to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards.
The cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the
vesting period of the awards. The standard provides for a
prospective application. Under this method, the Company will
begin recognizing compensation cost for equity based
compensation for all new or modified grants after the date of
adoption. In addition, the Company will recognize the unvested
portion of the grant date fair value of awards issued prior to
adoption based on the fair values previously calculated for
disclosure purposes. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate
value of unvested options, as determined using a Black-Scholes
option valuation model, was $467 million. Upon adoption of
SFAS 123R, a majority of this amount will be recognized
over the remaining vesting period of these options. The Company
will adopt SFAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. The
Company believes that the adoption of this standard will result
in a reduction of earnings per share by $0.06 to $0.08 in 2006.
This estimate is based on many assumptions including the level
of stock option grants expected in 2006, the Company’s
stock price, and significant assumptions in the



option valuation model including volatility and the expected
life of options. Actual expenses could differ from the estimate.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” (“SFAS 151”).
SFAS 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage, be charged to
expense in the period they are incurred rather than capitalized
as a component of inventory costs. In addition, SFAS 151
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversions based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. The Company is required to adopt
provisions of SFAS 151, on a prospective basis, as of
January 1, 2006. The Company does not believe the adoption
of SFAS 151 will have a material impact on the future
results of operations.

2. Discontinued Operations

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company completed the
separation of its semiconductor operations into a separate
subsidiary, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale
Semiconductor”). Under the terms of the Master Separation
and Distribution Agreement entered into between Motorola and
Freescale Semiconductor, Freescale Semiconductor has agreed to
indemnify Motorola for substantially all past, present and
future liabilities associated with the semiconductor business.
In July 2004, an initial public offering (“IPO”) of a
minority interest of approximately 32.5% of Freescale
Semiconductor was completed. As a result of the IPO the company
recorded additional paid-in capital of $397 million related
to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares
sold. Concurrently in July 2004, Freescale Semiconductor issued
senior debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of
$1.25 billion. On December 2, 2004, Motorola completed
the spin-off of its remaining 67.5% equity interest in Freescale
Semiconductor. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata
non-cash dividend to Motorola stockholders, which reduced
retained earnings by $2.5 billion. Holders of Motorola
stock at the close of business on November 26, 2004
received a dividend of .110415 shares of Freescale
Semiconductor Class B common stock per share of Motorola
common stock. No fractional shares of Freescale Semiconductor
were issued. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares of
Freescale Semiconductor Class B common stock in the
distribution received the cash value instead. The equity
distribution was structured to be tax-free to Motorola
stockholders for U.S. tax purposes (other than with respect
to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares). The
historical results of Freescale Semiconductor have been
reflected as discontinued operations in the underlying financial
statements and related disclosures for all periods presented.

operations:

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share from
both continuing operations and on a net earnings basis for the
year ended December 31, 2005, the assumed conversion of
44.8 million stock options were excluded because their
inclusion would have been antidilutive. In the computation of
diluted earnings per common share from both continuing
operations and on a net earnings basis for the year ended
December 31, 2004, the assumed conversion of
155.8 million stock options were excluded because their
inclusion would have been antidilutive. In the computation of
diluted earnings per common share from both continuing
operations and on a net earnings basis for the year ended
December 31, 2003, the assumed conversions of the zero
coupon notes due 2009, equity security units and

These impairment charges represent other-than-temporary declines
in the value of the Company’s investment portfolio. The
impairment charges in 2005 and 2004 are primarily related to

cost-based

investment

write-downs.

The
$96 million of impairment charges in 2003 is primarily
comprised of a $29 million charge to write down to zero the
Company’s debt security holdings in a European cable
operator and other cost-based investment write-downs. Investment
impairment charges are included in Other within Other income

During the first half of 2005, the Company sold
22.5 million shares of common stock of Nextel
Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”). The Company received
approximately $679 million in cash and realized a pre-tax
gain of $609 million from these sales. Subsequent to these
sales, the Company owned 25 million shares of common stock
and 29.7 million shares of non-voting common stock of
Nextel.

On August 12, 2005, Sprint Corporation completed its merger
(the “Sprint Nextel Merger”) with Nextel. In
connection with the Sprint Nextel Merger, Motorola received
$46 million in cash, 31.7 million voting shares and
37.6 million non-voting shares of Sprint Nextel Corporation
(“Sprint Nextel”), in exchange for its remaining
54.7 million shares of Nextel. As a result of this
transaction, the Company realized a gain of $1.3 billion,
comprised of a $1.7 billion gain recognized on the receipt
of cash and the 69.3 million shares of Sprint Nextel in
exchange for its shares of Nextel, net of a $418 million
loss recognized on its hedge of 25 million shares of common
stock of Nextel, as described below.

On December 14, 2004, in connection with the announcement
of the definitive agreement relating to the Sprint Nextel
Merger, Motorola, a Motorola subsidiary and Nextel entered into
an agreement pursuant to which Motorola and its subsidiary
agreed not dispose of their 29.7 million non-voting shares
of Nextel (now 37.6 million shares of non-voting common
stock of Sprint Nextel issued in exchange for Nextel non-voting
common stock pursuant to the Sprint Nextel Merger) for a period
of no longer than two years. In exchange for this agreement,
Nextel paid Motorola a fee of $50 million in 2005.

In March 2003, the Company entered into agreements with multiple
investment banks to hedge up to 25 million of its voting
shares of Nextel common stock over periods of three, four and
five years, respectively. Although the precise number of shares
of Nextel common stock the Company was required to deliver to
satisfy the contracts was dependent upon the price of Nextel
common stock on the various settlement dates, the maximum
aggregate number of shares was 25 million and the minimum
number of shares was 18.5 million. Prior to August 12,
2005, changes in the fair value of these variable share forward
purchase agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) were
recorded in Non-owner changes to equity included in
Stockholders’ equity. As a result of the Sprint Nextel
Merger, the Company realized the cumulative $418 million
loss relating to the Variable Forwards that had previously been
recorded in Stockholders’ equity. In addition, the Variable
Forwards purchase agreements were adjusted to reflect the
underlying economics of the Sprint Nextel Merger. The Company
did not designate the adjusted Variable Forwards as a hedge of
the Sprint Nextel shares received as a result of the merger.
Accordingly, the Company recorded $51 million of gains
reflecting the change in value of the Variable Forwards from
August 12, 2005 through the settlement of the Variable
Forwards of the instruments with the counterparties during the
fourth quarter of 2005.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company elected to settle
the Variable Forwards by delivering 30.3 million shares of
Sprint Nextel common stock, with a value of $725 million,
to the counterparties and selling the remaining 1.4 million
Sprint Nextel common shares in the open market. The Company
received aggregate cash proceeds of $391 million and
realized a loss of $70 million in connection with the
settlement and sale.

Total gains recognized in 2005 related to its investment in
Nextel and Sprint Nextel as described above were approximately
$1.8 billion included in Gains on Sales of Investments and
Businesses in Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated Statement of Operations plus $51 million of
gains related to the Variable Forwards included in Other in
Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statement of operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the $460 million
gain on sales of investments and businesses is primarily
comprised of: (i) a $130 million gain on the sale of
the Company’s remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation,
(ii) a $122 million gain on the sale of a portion of
the Company’s shares in Nextel, (iii) an
$82 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Telus Corporation, and (iv) a
$68 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel Partners, Inc.

On May 18, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of
Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to
$4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a

36-month

period ending
on May 31, 2008, subject to



market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2005,
the Company paid $874 million to repurchase
41.7 million shares pursuant to the program. All
repurchased shares have been retired.

4. Debt and Credit Facilities

Long-Term Debt

Short-Term Debt

In August 2005, the Company commenced cash tender offers for up
to $1.0 billion of certain of its outstanding long-term
debt. The tender offers expired on September 28, 2005 and
the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of
$1.0 billion of its outstanding long-term debt for an
aggregate purchase price of $1.1 billion. Included in the
$1.0 billion of long-term debt repurchased were repurchases
of a principal amount of: (i) $86 million of the
$200 million of 6.50% Notes due 2008 outstanding,
(ii) $241 million of the $325 million of
5.80% Notes due 2008 outstanding, and
(iii) $673 million of the $1.2 billion of
7.625% Notes due 2010 outstanding. In addition, the Company
terminated a notional amount of $1.0 billion of

fixed-to

-floating
interest rate swaps associated with the debt repurchased,
resulting in an expense of approximately $22 million. The
aggregate charge for the repurchase of the debt and the
termination of the associated interest rate swaps, as presented
in Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations, was $137 million.

On September 1, 2005, the Company retired approximately
$1 million of the $398 million of 6.5% Debentures
due 2025 (the “2025 Debentures”) in connection with
the holders of the debentures right to put their debentures back
to the Company. The residual put options expired unexercised and
the remaining $397 million of 2025 Debentures were
reclassified to long-term debt.

In August 2004, the Company completed the open market purchase
of $110 million of the $409 million aggregate
principal amount outstanding of its 6.50% Debentures due
2028 (the “2028 Debentures”). The



$110 million principal amount of 2028 Debentures was
purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$115 million.

In August 2004, pursuant to the terms of the 7.00% Equity
Security Units (the “MEUs”), the $1.2 billion of
6.50% Senior Notes due 2007 (the “2007 MEU
Notes”) that comprised a portion of the MEUs were
remarketed to a new set of holders. In connection with the
remarketing, the interest rate on the 2007 MEU Notes was reset
to 4.608%. None of the other terms of the 2007 MEU Notes were
changed. Shortly after the remarketing, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps to change the characteristics of the
interest rate payments from fixed-rate payments to short-term
LIBOR-based variable rate payments. Additionally, in November
2004, pursuant to the terms of the MEUs, the Company sold
69.4 million shares of common stock to the holders of the
MEUs. The purchase price per share was $17.30 resulting in
aggregate proceeds of $1.2 billion.

In July 2004, the Company commenced a cash tender offer for any
and all of the $300 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding of its 7.60% Notes due 2007 (the “2007
Notes”). The tender offer expired in August 2004 and an
aggregate principal amount of approximately $182 million of
2007 Notes was validly tendered. In August 2004, the Company
repurchased the validly tendered 2007 Notes for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $202 million. This debt was
repurchased with proceeds distributed to the Company by
Freescale Semiconductor.

In July 2004, the Company called for the redemption of the
$1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
6.75% Notes due 2006 (the “2006 Notes”). All of
the 2006 Notes were redeemed in August 2004 for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. This debt was
redeemed partially with proceeds distributed to the Company by
Freescale Semiconductor and partially with available cash
balances.

In June 2004, the Company repaid, at maturity, all
$500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
6.75% Debentures due 2004.

In March 2004, Motorola Capital Trust I, a Delaware
statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (the “Trust”), redeemed all outstanding
Trust Originated Preferred
Securities

sm

(“TOPrS”). In February 1999, the Trust sold
20 million TOPrS to the public for an aggregate offering
price of $500 million. The Trust used the proceeds from
that sale, together with the proceeds from its sale of common
stock to the Company, to buy a series of 6.68% Deferrable
Interest Junior Subordinated Debentures due March 31, 2039
(the “Subordinated Debentures”) from the Company with
the same payment terms as the TOPrS. The sole assets of the
Trust were the Subordinated Debentures. Historically, the TOPrS
have been reflected as “Company-Obligated Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding
Solely Company-Guaranteed Debentures” in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. On March 26, 2004, all
outstanding TOPrS were redeemed for an aggregate redemption
price of $500 million plus accrued interest. No TOPrS or
Subordinated Debentures remain outstanding.

In March 2004, the Company also redeemed all outstanding Liquid
Yield Option Notes due September 7, 2009 (the “2009
LYONs”) and all outstanding Liquid Yield Option Notes due
September 27, 2013 (the “2013 LYONs”). On
March 26, 2004, all then-outstanding 2009 LYONs and 2013
LYONs, not validly exchanged for stock, were redeemed for an
aggregate redemption price of approximately $4 million. No
2009 LYONs or 2013 LYONs remain outstanding.

Aggregate requirements for long-term debt maturities (assuming
earliest put date) during the next five years are as follows:
2006-$119 million;

2007-$1.2

billion;
2008-$200 million;

2009-$2

million.;
2010-$529 million

In May 2004, the Company signed a new

3-year

revolving credit
agreement for $1 billion, replacing two existing facilities
totaling $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2005, the
commitment fee assessed against the daily average amounts unused
was 12.5 basis points. Important terms of the credit
agreement include covenants relating to net interest coverage
and total debt to book capitalization ratios. The Company was in
compliance with the terms of the credit agreement at
December 31, 2005. The Company’s current corporate
credit ratings are “BBB+” with a “stable”
outlook by S&P, “Baa2” with a “stable”
outlook by Moody’s, and “BBB+” with a
“positive” outlook by Fitch. The Company has never
borrowed under its domestic revolving credit facilities. The
Company also has $1.9 billion of

non-U.S.

credit
facilities with interest rates on borrowings varying from
country to country depending upon local market conditions. At
December 31, 2005, the Company’s total domestic and

non-U.S.

credit
facilities totaled $2.9 billion, of which $95 million
was considered utilized.

5. Risk Management

Derivative Financial Instruments

Foreign Currency Risk

As a multinational company, the Company’s transactions are
denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses
financial instruments to hedge, or to reduce its overall
exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.
The Company’s policy is not to speculate in financial
instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
trade in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures,
or enter into trades for any currency to intentionally increase
the underlying exposure. Instruments that are designated as part
of a hedging relationship must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as
a part of a hedging relationship at the inception of the
contract. Accordingly, changes in market values of hedge
instruments must be highly correlated with changes in market
values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge
and over the life of the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
is to offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments
against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
or investments based on the operating business units’
assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts
for some of the Company’s non-functional currency
receivables and payables, which are denominated in major
currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company uses
forward contracts and options to hedge these currency exposures.
In addition, the Company enters into derivative contracts for
some firm commitments and some forecasted transactions which are
designated as part of a hedging relationship if it is determined
that the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting. A portion
of the Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not
traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent
reasonably possible, through managing net asset positions,
product pricing, and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had net
outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
$2.8 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not
subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities
and transactions except for the ineffective portion of the
instruments which are charged to Other within Other income
(expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations. The following table shows, in millions of
U.S. dollars, the five largest net foreign exchange
derivative positions as of December 31, 2005 compared to
their respective positions at December 31, 2004:

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
obligations. However, the Company does not expect any
counterparties, which presently have high credit ratings, to
fail to meet their obligations.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s short-term debt
consisted primarily of $300 million of commercial paper,
priced at short-term interest rates. The Company has
$4.0 billion of long-term debt, including current
maturities, which is primarily priced at long-term, fixed
interest rates.



In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
fixed-rate payments to short-term, LIBOR-based variable rate
payments. During the year ended December 31, 2005, in
conjunction with the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount
of $1.0 billion of long-term debt, the Company terminated a
notional amount of $1.0 billion of these swaps that were
associated with the repurchased debt resulting in expense of
approximately $22 million which is identified as debt
retirement within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The following table
displays which interest rate swaps were outstanding at
December 31, 2005:

The short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments on the above
interest rate swaps was 6.9% for the three months ended
December 31, 2005. The fair value of the interest rate
swaps at December 31, 2005 and 2004, was approximately
$(50) million and $3 million, respectively. Except for
these interest rate swaps, the Company had no outstanding
commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options relating to
debt instruments at December 31, 2005 or 2004.

The Company designated its interest rate swap agreements as part
of a fair value hedging relationship. Interest expense on the
debt is adjusted to include the payments made or received under
such hedge agreements.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
dealing with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions
having long-term debt ratings of “A” or better and,
does not anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts
are distributed among several financial institutions, thus
minimizing credit risk concentration.

Stockholders’ Equity

Derivative instruments activity, net of tax, included in
Non-Owner Changes to Equity within Stockholders’ Equity for
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:

Fair Value Hedges

The Company recorded income of $1.5 million,
$0.1 million and $3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of fair value hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company excluded the
change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the
changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward
price from the measure of effectiveness as these amounts are
charged to Other within Other income (expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Expense
(income) related to fair value hedges that were discontinued for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are
included in the amounts noted above.



Cash Flow Hedges

The Company recorded expense (income) of $(0.5) million,
$11.9 million and $(1.5) million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company excluded the
change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the
changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward
price from the measure of effectiveness as these amounts are
charged to Other within Other income (expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Expense
(income) related to cash flow hedges that were discontinued for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2004 are
included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, on
a pre-tax basis, expense (income) of $(21) million,
$27 million and $(1) million, respectively, was
reclassified from equity to earnings and is included in Other
within Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. If exchange rates do not change from
year-end, the Company estimates that $2 million of pre-tax
net derivative expense included in Non-Owner Changes to Equity
within Stockholders’ Equity would be reclassified into
earnings within the next twelve months and will be reclassified
in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings. The
actual amounts that will be reclassified into earnings over the
next twelve months will vary from this amount as a result of
changes in market conditions.

At December 31, 2005, the maximum term of derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was three years.
However, the weighted average duration of the Company’s
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
4 months.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company did not have any
hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
foreign operations.

Investments Hedge

In March 2003, the Company entered into agreements with multiple
investment banks to hedge up to 25 million of its voting
shares of Nextel common stock over periods of three, four and
five years, respectively. Although the precise number of shares
of Nextel common stock the Company was required to deliver to
satisfy the contracts was dependent upon the price of Nextel
common stock on the various settlement dates, the maximum
aggregate number of shares was 25 million and the minimum
number of shares was 18.5 million. Prior to August 12,
2005, changes in the fair value of these variable share forward
purchase agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) were
recorded in Non-owner changes to equity included in
Stockholders’ equity. As a result of the Sprint Nextel
Merger, the Company realized the cumulative $418 million
loss relating to the Variable Forwards that had previously been
recorded in Stockholders’ equity. In addition, the Variable
Forwards purchase agreements were adjusted to reflect the
underlying economics of the Sprint Nextel Merger. The Company
did not designate the adjusted Variable Forwards as a hedge of
the Sprint Nextel shares received as a result of the merger.
Accordingly, the Company recorded $51 million of gains
reflecting the change in value of the Variable Forwards from
August 12, 2005 through the settlement of the Variable
Forwards with the counterparties during the fourth quarter of
2005.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company elected to settle
the Variable Forwards by delivering 30.3 million shares of
Sprint Nextel common stock, with a value of $725 million,
to the counterparties and selling the remaining 1.4 million
Sprint Nextel common shares in the open market. The Company
received aggregate cash proceeds of $391 million and
realized a loss of $70 million in connection with the
settlement and sale.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
equivalents, Sigma Funds, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt, foreign
currency contracts and other financing commitments.

Using available market information, the Company determined that
the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2005 was
$4.3 billion compared to a carrying value of
$4.0 billion. Since considerable judgment is



required in interpreting market information, the fair value of
the long-term debt is not necessarily indicative of the amount
which could be realized in a current market exchange.

The fair values of the other financial instruments were not
materially different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2005.

6. Income Taxes

Components of earnings (loss) from continuing operations before
income taxes are as follows:

1,376

Components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:

Deferred tax charges (benefits) that were recorded within
Non-Owner Changes to Equity in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets resulted primarily from fair value adjustments to
available-for-sale securities, losses on derivative instruments
and minimum pension liability adjustments. The adjustments were
$(753) million, $(189) million and $440 million
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Except for certain earnings that the Company
intends to reinvest indefinitely, provisions have been made for
the estimated U.S. federal income taxes applicable to
undistributed earnings of

non-U.S.

subsidiaries.
Undistributed earnings that the Company intends to reinvest
indefinitely, and for which no U.S. Federal income taxes
has been provided, aggregate $2.8 billion,
$5.6 billion and $5.1 billion at December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The portion of earnings not
reinvested indefinitely may be distributed substantially free of
additional U.S. federal income taxes given the
U.S. federal tax provisions accrued on undistributed
earnings and the utilization of available foreign tax credits.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(“the Act”) was signed into law. The Act provides for
a special one-time tax incentive for U.S. multinationals to
repatriate accumulated earnings from their foreign subsidiaries
by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain
qualifying dividends. The Company repatriated approximately
$4.6 billion of accumulated foreign earnings under the Act
and recorded an associated net income tax benefit of
$265 million. The net income tax benefit included a
$303 million tax benefit relating to the repatriation under
the Act, offset by a $38 million tax charge for the
reassessment of the Company’s cash position and related tax
liability associated with the remaining foreign undistributed
earnings.



Differences between income tax expense (benefit) computed at the
U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and income tax
expense (benefit) are as follows:

Significant components of deferred tax assets
(liabilities) are as follows:

Gross deferred tax assets were $10.0 billion,
$9.8 billion and $8.8 billion at December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Deferred tax assets, net of
valuation allowances, were $9.1 billion, $8.9 billion
and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Gross deferred tax liabilities were
$5.5 billion, $5.0 billion and $3.9 billion at
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company had deferred tax assets for U.S. tax
carryforwards totaling $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At
December 31, 2005, these carryforwards were comprised of
$247 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards,
$135 million of state net operating loss carryforwards,
$780 million of foreign tax credit carryovers,
$270 million of general business credit carryovers,
$75 million of minimum tax credit carryforwards,
$7 million of capital loss carryforwards and
$54 million of state tax credit and other carryforwards.

A majority of the U.S. net operating losses and general
business credits can be carried forward for 20 years,
capital losses can be carried forward for five years and minimum
tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. The
carryforward period for foreign tax credits was extended to
10 years, from 5 years, during 2004 due to the
enactment of the Act. The Company has $35 million of
foreign tax credits scheduled to expire in 2011 and the
remaining from 2013 through 2015 and $50 million of general
business credits scheduled to expire in 2018 and the remaining
from 2019 through 2025. The Company has deferred tax assets of
$168 million, $7 million and $9 million of
Federal net operating loss, capital loss and general business
credit carryforwards, respectively, from acquired subsidiaries
which have limitations placed on their availability and the
Company has recorded $184 million



of valuation allowances against these carryforwards. The Company
has also recorded $87 million of valuation allowance
against certain state tax loss carryforwards and state tax
credits with carryforward period of seven years or less. During
2005, the Company reduced its valuation allowance against
certain State tax carryforwards by $15 million based on the
likelihood that the Company will utilize the tax carryforwards
before they expire. The Company believes that the remaining
U.S. deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be
realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and the
implementation of tax planning strategies.

The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries, primarily in Germany
and the UK, had deferred tax assets from tax carryforwards of
$530 million and $634 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had $428 million of deferred tax assets for tax
carryforwards which can be carried forward indefinitely,
$78 million which will expire in seven years or less and
$24 million which will expire in 15 years or less. At
December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded valuation
allowances of $461 million against its German, UK and
certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries tax loss and credit
carryforwards and valuation allowances of $164 million
against other deferred tax assets of its non-U.S. subsidiaries.
During 2005, the Company realized tax benefits of
$76 million relating to the reversal of foreign valuation
allowances on tax carryforwards and deferred tax assets that
were utilized during the year. The Company believes that the
remaining deferred tax assets of its non-U.S. subsidiaries are
more likely than not to be realizable based on estimates of
future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning
strategies.

During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
started its field examination of the Company’s 2001 through
2003 tax returns. The IRS has proposed certain adjustments to
the Company’s income and credit for these tax years that
would result in additional tax. In the Company’s opinion,
the final disposition of these proposed adjustments will not
have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company. The
Company anticipates the completion of the field examination
during 2006.

During 2004, the IRS completed its field examination of the
Company’s 1996 through 2000 tax returns. The examination is
now at the appellate level of the IRS. In connection with this
examination, the Company received notices of certain adjustments
proposed by the IRS, primarily related to transfer pricing. The
Company disagrees with these proposed transfer pricing-related
adjustments and intends to vigorously dispute this matter
through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate.
However, if the IRS were to ultimately prevail on all matters
relating to transfer pricing for the period of the examination,
it could result in additional taxable income for the years 1996
through 2000 of approximately $1.4 billion, which could
result in additional income tax liability for the Company of
approximately $500 million. The IRS may make similar claims
for years subsequent to 2000 in future audits. Although the
final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain, based
on current information, in the opinion of the Company’s
management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of
operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the
period in which the matter is ultimately resolved.

During 2005, the Company reached favorable agreements with
several

non-U.S.

taxing
authorities that resulted in net income tax benefits of
$28 million. The Company has several other non-U.S. income
tax audits pending and while the final resolution is uncertain,
in the opinion of the Company’s management the ultimate
disposition of the audits will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

7. Employee Benefit and Incentive Plans

Pension Benefits

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
“Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. The Company
also provides defined benefit plans to some of its foreign
entities (the

“Non-U.S.

Plans”).

The Company also has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
elected officers. The Officers’ Plan contains provisions
for funding the participants’ expected retirement benefits
when the participants meet the minimum age and years of service
requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the
Officers’ Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option
to remain in the Officers’ Plan or elect to have their
benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective
December 31, 1999, no new elected officers were eligible to
participate in the Officers’ Plan. Effective June 30,
2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.



The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
(“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits in
excess of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code
on the Regular Pension Plan. All newly elected officers are
participants in MSPP. Elected officers covered under the
Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP.

The net U.S. periodic pension cost for the regular pension
plan, officers’ plan, MSPP and Non U.S. plans was as
follows:

Regular Pension Plan

Officers’ Plan and MSPP

Non-U.S. Plans



The status of the Company’s plans is as follows:

The Company uses a five-year, market-related asset value method
of amortizing asset-related gains and losses. Prior service
costs are being amortized over periods ranging from 9 to
15 years. The benefit obligation and related assets have
been measured as of December 31, 2005 for all
U.S. plans and as of October 1, 2005 for all
Non-U.S. plans. Benefits under all U.S. pension plans
are valued based upon the projected unit credit cost method.

Certain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the
long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant
effect on the amounts reported for net periodic cost as well as
the related obligation amounts of the Company’s plans. The
assumed discount rates reflects the prevailing market rates of a
large population of high-quality, non-callable, corporate bonds
currently available that, if the obligation was settled at the
measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows
to pay the benefit obligation when due. The long-term rate of
return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term
returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of
equities, fixed income, and cash and other investments. In
determining the long-term return on plan assets, the Company
considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both
historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the plan
funds to be invested.



Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs
for the plans were as follows:

Negative financial market returns during 2000 through 2002
resulted in a decline in the fair-market value of plan assets.
This, when combined with declining discount rate assumptions in
the last several years, has resulted in a decline in the
plans’ funded status. Consequently, the Company’s
accumulated benefits obligation exceeded the fair-market value
of the plan assets for various plans including the Regular
Pension Plan, the Officers’ Pension Plan and certain Non
U.S. plans.

The accumulated benefit obligations for the plans were as
follows:

As required, after-tax charges of $208 million,
$188 million and $182 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were
recorded to reflect the net change in the Company’s
additional minimum pension liability associated with these
plans. This change was included in Non-Owner Changes to Equity
in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has adopted an pension investment policy designed to
meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets
assumption. To achieve this, the pension plans retain
professional investment managers that invest plan assets in
equity and fixed income securities and cash. In addition, some
plans invest in insurance contracts. The Company has the
following target mixes for these asset classes, which are
readjusted at least quarterly, when an asset class weighting
deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the
required return at a reasonable risk level as follows:

The weighted-average pension plan asset allocation at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 by asset categories was as
follows:



Within the equity securities asset class, the investment policy
provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded
securities including both domestic and international stocks.
Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment
policy provides for investments in a broad range of
publicly-traded debt securities ranging from US Treasury issues,
corporate debt securities, mortgages and asset-backed issues, as
well as international debt securities. In the cash and other
investments asset class, investments may be in cash, cash
equivalents or insurance contracts.

The Company expects to make a cash contribution of approximately
$275 million to its U.S. pension plans and
$44 million to its Non-U.S. pension plans in 2006.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

Postretirement Health Care Benefits

Certain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic
employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
termination of employment. For eligible employees hired prior to
January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
January 1, 2005, the postretirement healthcare plan has
been closed to new participants.

In connection with the spin-off of Freescale Semiconductor,
post-retirement health care benefit obligations relating to
eligible former and active vested Freescale Semiconductor
employees on December 2, 2004 (Spin-off Date) and active
Freescale Semiconductor employees who vest within the three year
period following the Spin-off Date, were transferred to
Freescale Semiconductor. Benefit obligations transferred were
$217 million with $99 million of unrecognized net
losses also transferred to Freescale Semiconductor. Such amounts
have been excluded from the Motorola amounts for both periods
presented above. Additionally under the terms of the Employee
Matters Agreement entered into between Motorola and Freescale
Semiconductor, Motorola is obligated to transfer to Freescale
Semiconductor $68 million in cash or Plan assets plus
approximately $7 million of investment returns earned on
these plan assets as of December 31, 2005, as permitted by
law without adverse tax consequences to Motorola. This
obligation is included in Accrued Liabilities in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has adopted an investment policy for plan assets
designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan
assets assumption. To achieve this, the plan retains
professional investment managers that invest plan assets in
equity and fixed income securities and cash. The Company has the
following target mixes for these asset classes, which are
readjusted at least quarterly, when an asset class weighting
deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the

Cash contributions of $43 million were made to the retiree
healthcare plan in 2005. The Company expects to make a cash
contribution of $45 million to the retiree health care plan
in 2006.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future

2011-2015


The health care trend rate used to determine the
December 31, 2005 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation is 10.0% for 2006. Beyond 2006 the trend rate is
graded down 1.0% per year until it reaches 5.0% by 2011 and
then remains flat. The health care trend rate used to determine
the December 31, 2004 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 10.0% for 2005 with the trend rate graded down
per year until reaching 5.0% by 2010 and then remaining flat.

Changing the health care trend rate by one percentage point

Due to the Company’s lifetime maximum cap on postretirement

trend assumption has a small impact on the liability and related
expense.

The Company has no significant postretirement health care
benefit plans outside the United States.



Stock Compensation Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through
payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible compensation on an
after-tax basis. The price an employee pays per share is 85% of
the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s stock
on the close of the first trading day or last trading day of the
purchase period. The plan has two purchase periods, the first
one from October 1 through March 31 and the second one
from April 1 through September 30. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, employees purchased
11.7 million, 13.1 million and 20.5 million
shares, respectively, at prices ranging from $12.66 to $12.72,
$10.31 to $15.33 and $7.02 to $7.10, respectively.

Stock Options

Under the Company’s stock option plans, options to acquire
shares of common stock have been made available for grant to
certain employees, non-employee directors and to existing option
holders in connection with the merging of option plans following
an acquisition. Each option granted has an exercise price of
100% of the market value of the common stock on the date of
grant. The majority of the options have a contractual life of
10 years and vest and become exercisable at 25% increments
over four years.

Upon the occurrence of a change in control, each stock option
outstanding on the date on which the change in control occurs
will immediately become exercisable in full.

On December 2, 2004, in connection with the distribution of
Freescale Semiconductor to Motorola shareholders, certain
adjustments were made to outstanding stock options. For vested
and unvested options held by Motorola employees and vested
options held by Freescale Semiconductor employees, the number of
underlying shares and the exercise price of the options were
adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value and the ratio of the
exercise price to the fair market value of an underlying share
that existed immediately prior to the distribution. In addition,
the contractual life of the vested options held by Freescale
Semiconductor employees was truncated according to the terms of
the original grant. Unvested options held by Freescale
Semiconductor employees expired according to the terms of the
original grants. No other adjustments were made to the terms of
the original option grants.

Stock options activity was as follows (in thousands, except
exercise price and employee data):

*

The 39,447 options terminated, cancelled or expired includes
    approximately 22,000 options that were unvested and forfeited by
    employees of Freescale Semiconductor as of the spin-off.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, 79.6 million shares and
111.2 million shares, respectively, were available for
future grants under the terms of these plans.



The following table summarizes information about stock options
outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2005 (in
thousands, except exercise price and years):

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Grants

Restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants
(“restricted stock”) consist of shares or the rights
to shares of the Company’s common stock which are awarded
to employees. The grants are restricted such that they are
subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and to restrictions on
their sale or other transfer by the employee. Upon the
occurrence of a change in control, the restrictions on all
shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units
outstanding on the date on which the change in control occurs
will lapse.

Total restricted stock and restricted stock units issued and
outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were
4.4 million and 6.0 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the amount of related deferred
compensation reflected in Stockholders’ Equity in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets was $37 million
and $36 million, respectively. Net additions to deferred
compensation for both the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004 were $15 million and $10 million, respectively.
An aggregate of approximately 1.7 million,
1.1 million, and 2.5 million shares of restricted
stock and restricted stock units were granted in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The amortization of deferred compensation
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
$14 million, $24 million and $36 million,
respectively.

Other Benefits

Defined Contribution Plans:

The Company and
certain subsidiaries have various defined contribution plans, in
which all eligible employees participate.

In the U.S., the 401(k) plan is a contributory plan. Matching
contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’
contributions. Effective January 1, 2005, newly hired
employees have a higher maximum matching contribution at 4% on
the first 6% of employee contributions, compared to 3% for
employees hired prior to January 2005.

Company contributions, primarily relating to the employer match,
to all plans for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 were $81 million, $74 million and
$67 million, respectively. Effective January 1, 2005,
the plan was amended to exclude the profit sharing component.
The profit sharing contribution for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was $69 million. There was no profit
sharing contribution for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Before 2005, profit sharing contributions were generally based
upon pre-tax earnings, as defined, with an adjustment for the
aggregate matching contribution.

Motorola Incentive Plan:

The Motorola Incentive
Plan provides eligible employees with an annual payment,
calculated as a percentage of an employee’s eligible
earnings, in the year after the close of the current calendar
year if specified business goals are met. The provision for
awards under these incentive plans for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $548 million,
$771 million and $422 million, respectively.

Mid-Range Incentive Plan:

The Mid-Range Incentive
Plan (“MRIP”) rewards participating elected officers
for the Company’s achievement of outstanding performance
during the period, based on two performance



objectives measured over two-year cycles. The provision for MRIP
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
$19 million, $56 million and $5 million,
respectively.

Long-Range Incentive Plan:

In 2005, a Long Range
Incentive Plan (“LRIP”) was introduced to replace the
current MRIP. LRIP rewards participating elected officers for
the Company’s achievement of outstanding performance during
the period, based on two performance objectives measured over
three-year cycles. The provision for LRIP for the year ended
December 31, 2005 was $15 million.

Reclassification of Incentive Compensation Costs:

The consolidated statements of operations include reclassified
incentive compensation costs, which were previously reported as
a component of Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expenditures, to Cost of sales and
Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
based upon the function in which the related employees operate.
The impact of this reclassification was: (i) a reduction in
Gross margin of $89 million, $143 million and
$64 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
(ii) a decrease in SG&A expenditures of
$334 million, $495 million and $244 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and (iii) an increase in
R&D expenditures of $245 million, $352 million and
$180 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
reclassification has also been reflected within the quarterly
financial information provided in Note 15. The reclassifications
did not affect Net sales, Operating earnings, Earnings from
continuing operations, net earnings or earnings per share.

Current finance receivables are included in Accounts Receivable
and long-term finance receivables are included in Other Assets
in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Interest
income recognized on finance receivables for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $7 million,
$9 million and $18 million, respectively.

An analysis of impaired finance receivables included in total
finance receivables is as follows:

Interest income on impaired finance receivables is recognized as
cash is collected and totaled less than $1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005 and $2 million and
$5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

On October 28, 2005, the Company announced that it settled
the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ financial and
legal claims against Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri
A.S. (“Telsim”). The Government of Turkey and the
Turkish Savings and Deposit Insurance Fund (“TMSF”)
are third-party beneficiaries of the settlement agreement. In
settlement of its claims, the Company received $500 million
in cash and the right to receive 20% of any proceeds in excess
of $2.5 billion from any sale of Telsim. On
December 13, 2005, Vodafone agreed to purchase Telsim for
$4.55 billion, pursuant to a sales process organized by the
TMSF. This purchase has not yet been completed. Accordingly,
Motorola expects to receive an additional cash payment of
$410 million upon the completion of the sale. The gross
receivable outstanding from Telsim was zero at December 31,
2005. The Company is permitted to, and will continue to, enforce
its U.S. court judgment against the Uzan family, except in
Turkey and three other countries. As a result of difficulties in
collecting the amounts due from Telsim, the



Company had previously recorded charges reducing the net
receivable from Telsim to zero. The net receivable from Telsim
has been zero since 2002.

From time to time, the Company sells short-term receivables,
long-term loans and lease receivables under sales-type leases
(collectively, “finance receivables”) to third parties
in transactions that qualify as “true-sales.” Certain
of these finance receivables are sold to third parties on a
one-time, non-recourse basis, while others are sold to third
parties under committed facilities that involve contractual
commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying
receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
facilities may be revolving in nature. Certain sales may be made
through separate legal entities that are also consolidated by
the Company. The Company may or may not retain the obligation to
service the sold finance receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2005, these committed
facilities provided for up to $1.1 billion to be
outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
up to $724 million provided at December 31, 2004 and
up to $598 million provided at December 31, 2003. As
of December 31, 2005, $585 million of these committed
facilities were utilized, compared to $305 million utilized
at December 31, 2004 and $295 million utilized at
December 31, 2003. Certain events could cause one of these
facilities to terminate. In addition, before receivables can be
sold under certain of the committed facilities they may need to
meet contractual requirements, such as credit quality or
insurability.

Total finance receivables sold by the Company were
$4.5 billion in 2005 (including $4.2 billion of
short-term receivables), compared to $3.8 billion sold in
2004 (including $3.8 billion of short-term receivables) and
$2.8 billion sold in 2003 (including $2.7 billion of
short-term receivables). As of December 31, 2005, there
were $1.0 billion of receivables outstanding under these
programs for which the Company retained servicing obligations
(including $838 million of short-term receivables),
compared to $720 million outstanding at December 31,
2004 (including $589 of short-term receivables) and
$557 million outstanding at December 31, 2003
(including $378 of short-term receivables).

Under certain of the receivables programs, the value of the
receivables sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from
independent insurance companies, less deductibles or
self-insurance requirements under the policies (with the Company
retaining credit exposure for the remaining portion). The
Company’s total credit exposure to outstanding short-term
receivables that have been sold was $66 million at
December 31, 2005 as compared to $25 million at
December 31, 2004. Reserves of $4 million were
recorded for potential losses on sold receivables at both
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

Certain purchasers of the Company’s infrastructure
equipment continue to request that suppliers provide financing
in connection with equipment purchases. These requests may
include all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment
as well as working capital. Periodically, the Company makes
commitments to provide financing to purchasers in connection
with the sale of equipment. However, the Company’s
obligation to provide financing is often conditioned on the
issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a
reputable bank to support the purchaser’s credit or a
pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the
receivable from the Company. The Company had outstanding
commitments to extend credit to third-parties totaling
$689 million at December 31, 2005, compared to
$294 million at December 31, 2004. Of these amounts,
$594 million was supported by letters of credit or by bank
commitments to purchase receivables at December 31, 2005,
compared to $162 million at December 31, 2004.

In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment
customers, the Company also assists customers in obtaining
financing directly from banks and other sources to fund
equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide
financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling
$115 million and $78 million at December 31, 2005
and December 31, 2004, respectively (including
$66 million and $70 million, respectively, relating to
the sale of short-term receivables). Customer financing
guarantees outstanding were $71 million and
$29 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively (including $42 million and
$25 million, respectively, relating to the sale of
short-term receivables).

9. Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

The Company owns most of its major facilities, but does lease
certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, and
information technology and other equipment under principally
non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense, net of sublease
income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
was $254 million,



$217 million and $223 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2005, future minimum lease obligations, net of
minimum sublease rentals, for the next five years and beyond are
as follows: 2006— $438 million; 2007—
$190 million; 2008— $134 million; 2009—
$109 million; 2010— $84 million; beyond—
$195 million.

Legal

Iridium Program:

The Company has been named as one of
several defendants in putative class action securities lawsuits
arising out of alleged misrepresentations or omissions regarding
the Iridium satellite communications business, which on
March 15, 2001, were consolidated in the District of
Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications,
Inc., et al.

, originally filed on April 22, 1999.
On August 31, 2004, the court denied the motions to dismiss
that had been filed on July 15, 2002 by the Company and the
other defendants.

The Company was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
Creditors of Iridium in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York on July 19, 2001.

In re Iridium
Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserts claims
for breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty, and fraudulent
transfer and preferences, and seeks in excess of $4 billion
in damages. Trial has been scheduled for August 7, 2006.

The Company has not reserved for any potential liability that
may arise as a result of the litigation described above related
to the Iridium program. While the still pending cases are in
various stages and the outcomes are not predictable, an
unfavorable outcome of one or more of these cases could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Other:

The Company is a defendant in various other suits,
claims and investigations that arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, and other than as
discussed above with respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

Other

The Company is also a party to a variety of agreements pursuant
to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with
respect to certain matters. Some of these obligations arise as a
result of divestitures of the Company’s assets or
businesses and require the Company to hold the other party
harmless against losses arising from adverse tax outcomes. The
total amount of indemnification under these types of provisions
at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $28 million and
$37 million, respectively, with the Company accruing
$1 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively, for certain claims that have been
asserted under these provisions.

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses
that result from the breach of general warranties contained in
certain commercial, intellectual property and divestiture
agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant
payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant
claims asserted against the Company.

In all cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other
party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the
particular contract, which procedures typically allow the
Company to challenge the other party’s claims. Further, the
Company’s obligations under these agreements are generally
limited in terms of duration, typically not more than
24 months, and for amounts not in excess of the contract
value, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse
against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.

attach certain rights to existing shares of common stock,
$3 par value, of the Company at the rate of one right for
each share of common stock.

Each right entitles a shareholder to buy, under certain
circumstances, one thirty-thousandth of a share of preferred
stock for $66.66. The rights generally will be exercisable only
if a person or group acquires 10% or more of the Company’s
common stock or begins a tender or exchange offer for 10% or
more of the Company’s common stock. If a person acquires
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the Company’s common
stock, all holders of rights other than the acquiring person,
will be entitled to purchase the Company’s common stock
(or, in certain cases, common equivalent shares) at a 50%
discount. The Company may redeem the new rights at a price of
$0.0033 per right. The rights will expire on
November 20, 2008.

12. Reorganization of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
“Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
and employment grade level in the event that employment is
involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in

-force or
restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in

-force has
qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and,
therefore, such benefits are accounted for in accordance with
Statement No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits” (“SFAS 112”). Under the provisions
of SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefits
based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time
that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably
estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a
restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs
primarily consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated
facilities. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its



accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure
the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances,
accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in
carrying out the plans or because employees previously
identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not
receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not
foreseen when the original plans were initiated. The Company
reverses accruals through the income statement line item where
the original charges were recorded when it is determined they
are no longer required.

2005 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
initiated various productivity improvement plans aimed
principally at improving manufacturing and distribution
efficiencies and reducing costs in its integrated

supply-chain

organization, as well as reducing other operating expenses. The
Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of
$106 million, including $40 million of charges in
Costs of Sales and $66 million of charges under Other
Charges in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. Included in the aggregate $106 million are
charges of $102 million for employee separation costs,
$15 million for fixed asset adjustments and $5 million
for exit costs, partially offset by $16 million of
reversals for accruals no longer needed. Total employees
impacted by these actions are 2,625.

The following table displays the net reorganization of business
charges by segment:

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$84 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2005 additional charges of $5 million
were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Government
and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. The 2005 adjustments
of $7 million represent reversals of $1 million for
accruals no longer needed and $6 million of translation
adjustments. The $27 million used in 2005 reflects cash
payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of $55 million,
which is included in Accrued Liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$46 million for employee separation costs, representing the
severance costs for approximately 500 employees, of which 50
were direct employees and 450 were indirect employees. The 2005
additional charges of $102 million represent costs for an
additional 2,625 employees, of



which 1,350 were direct employees and 1,275 were indirect
employees. The adjustments of $16 million represent
reversals of accruals no longer needed.

During 2005, approximately 1,500 employees, of which 300 were
direct employees and 1,200 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $79 million used in 2005
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $53 million, which is included in
Accrued Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2005, is expected to be paid to
approximately 1,600 employees to be separated in 2006.

2004 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
recorded net reorganization of business reversals of
$12 million, including $3 million of charges in Costs
of Sales and $15 million of reversals under Other Charges
in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
Included in the aggregate $12 million are charges of
$59 million for employee separation costs and
$5 million for fixed asset adjustment income, partially
offset by $66 million of reversals for accruals no longer
needed. Total employees impacted by these action were
approximately 900.

partially offset by an $11 million translation adjustment.
The $38 million used in 2004 reflects cash payments to
lessors. The remaining accrual of $84 million, which is

consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

severance costs for approximately



900 employees, of which 100 were direct employees and 800
were indirect employees. The adjustments of $34 million
represent reversals of accruals no longer needed.

During 2004, approximately 2,500 employees, of which 1,000 were
direct employees and 1,500 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $95 million used in 2004
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $46 million was included in Accrued
Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2004.

2003 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company
recorded net reorganization of business charges of
$39 million, including $16 million of charges in Costs
of Sales and $23 million of charges under Other Charges in
the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
Included in the aggregate $39 million are charges of
$212 million, partially offset by $173 million of
reversals for accruals no longer needed. The charges primarily
consisted of: (i) $85 million in the Mobile Devices
segment, primarily related to the exit of certain manufacturing
activities in Flensburg, Germany and the closure of an
engineering center in Boynton Beach, Florida,
(ii) $50 million in the Government and Enterprise
Mobility Solutions segment for

segment-wide

employee
separation costs, and (iii) $39 million in General
Corporate, primarily for the impairment of assets classified as

held-for-sale

and
employee separation costs. The $212 million of charges were
partially offset by reversals of previous accruals of
$173 million, consisting of: (i) $125 million
relating to unused accruals of

previously-expected

employee separation costs across all segments,
(ii) $28 million, primarily for assets that the
Company intended to use that were previously classified as

held-for-sale,

and
(iii) $20 million for exit cost accruals no longer
required across all segments.

no longer needed. The $57 million used in 2003 reflects
cash payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of
$143 million, which is included in Accrued Liabilities in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2003, represents future cash payments for
lease termination obligations.



Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2003, the Company had an accrual of
$336 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 5,700 employees, of which

severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen
when the original plans were approved.

During 2003, approximately 5,200 employees, of which 2,000 were
direct employees and 3,200 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $258 million used in 2003
reflects $254 million of cash payments to these separated
employees and $4 million of non-cash utilization. The
remaining accrual of $116 million was included in Accrued
Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2003.

13. Acquisitions and Related Intangibles

The Company accounts for acquisitions using purchase accounting
with the results of operations for each acquiree included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the period
subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of
these acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements were not significant individually nor in the
aggregate.

The allocation of value to in-process research and development
was determined using expected future cash flows discounted at
average risk adjusted rates reflecting both technological and
market risk as well as the time value of money. Historical
pricing, margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used
in the valuation of the in-process products. The in-process
research and development acquired will have no alternative
future uses if the products are not feasible.

The developmental products for the companies acquired have
varying degrees of timing, technology,

costs-to

-complete and
market risks throughout final development. If the products fail
to become viable, the Company will unlikely be able to realize
any value from the sale of incomplete technology to another
party or through internal re-use. The risks of market acceptance
for the products under development and potential reductions in
projected sales volumes and related profits in the event of
delayed market availability for any of the products exist.
Efforts to complete all developmental products continue and
there are no known delays to forecasted plans.

The Company did not have any significant acquisitions in 2005.
The following is a summary of significant acquisitions in 2004
and 2003:



The following table summarizes net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and the consideration provided for the
acquisitions identified above:

MeshNetworks

In November 2004, the Company acquired MeshNetworks, Inc.
(“MeshNetworks”), a developer of mobile mesh
networking and position location technologies that allow
customers to deploy high-performance, Internet Protocol-based
wireless broadband networks, for $169 million in cash.

The Company recorded approximately $119 million in
goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes, a $16 million charge for acquired in-process
research and development, and $20 million in other
intangibles. The acquired in-process research and development
will have no alternative future uses if the products are not
feasible. At the date of the acquisition, a total of three
projects were in process. The average risk adjusted rate used to
value these projects was 45%. The allocation of value to
in-process research and development was determined using
expected future cash flows discounted at average risk adjusted
rates reflecting both technological and market risk as well as
the time value of money. These research and development costs
were written off at the date of acquisition and have been
included in Other Charges in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. Goodwill and intangible assets are
included in Other Assets in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets. The intangible assets will be amortized over a
period of 5 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of MeshNetworks have been included in
the Government and Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent to
the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of this
acquisition on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements were not significant.

Force Computers

In August 2004, the Company acquired Force Computers,
(“Force”), a worldwide designer and supplier of open,
standards-based and custom embedded computing solutions, for
$121 million in cash.

The Company recorded approximately $59 million in goodwill,
none of which was deductible for tax purposes, a $2 million
charge for acquired in-process research and development, and
$35 million in other intangibles. The in-process research
and development costs were written off at the date of
acquisition and have been included in Other Charges in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill
and intangible assets are included in Other Assets in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The intangible
assets will be amortized over a period of 5 years on a
straight-line basis.

The results of operations of Force have been included in the
Networks segment in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma
effects of this acquisition on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements were not significant.

Winphoria Networks

In May 2003, the Company acquired Winphoria Networks, Inc.
(“Winphoria”), a core infrastructure provider of
next-generation, packet-based mobile switching centers for
wireless networks, for approximately $179 million in cash.



The Company recorded approximately $93 million in goodwill,
none of which was deductible for tax purposes, a
$32 million charge for acquired in-process research and
development, and $54 million in other intangibles. The
acquired in-process research and development will have no
alternative future uses if the products are not feasible. At the
date of the acquisition, a total of eight projects were in
process. The average risk adjusted rate used to value these
projects ranged from 25% to 28%. The allocation of value to
in-process research and development was determined using
expected future cash flows discounted at average risk adjusted
rates reflecting both technological and market risk as well as
the time value of money. These research and development costs
were written off at the date of acquisition and have been
included in Other Charges in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. Goodwill and intangible assets are
included in Other Assets in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets. The intangible assets will be amortized over
periods ranging from 3 to 5 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of Winphoria have been included in the
Networks segment in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma
effects of this acquisition on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements were not significant.

Intangible Assets

Amortized intangible assets, excluding goodwill were comprised
of the following:

Amortization expense on intangible assets was $69 million,
$53 million and $101 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Future
amortization expense is estimated to be as follows: 2006—
$75 million; 2007— $61 million; 2008—
$42 million; 2009— $30 million and 2010—
$14 million.

The following tables display a rollforward of the carrying
amount of goodwill from January 1, 2004 to
December 31, 2005, by business segment:

The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit
level and is a two-step analysis. First, the fair value
(FV) of each reporting unit is compared to its book value.
If the FV of the reporting unit is less than its book value, the
Company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation based
on the reporting unit’s fair value



to determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s
goodwill. Fair value is determined with the help of independent
appraisal firms using a combination of present value techniques
and quoted market prices of comparable businesses. No impairment
charges were required for the year ended December 31, 2005.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
determined that goodwill related to a sensor group, which was
subsequently divested in 2005, was impaired by a total of
$125 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003 the
Company determined that goodwill at the infrastructure reporting
unit of the Connected Home Solutions segment was impaired by
$73 million.

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior
management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective such that the information
relating to Motorola, including our consolidated subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated
and communicated to Motorola’s management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.

Motorola’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in
Rule

13a-15(f)

of
the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our senior management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, we assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, using the criteria set forth in
the

Internal Control— Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is
effective as of December 31, 2005. KPMG LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
audit report on management’s assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2005 that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures,
that Motorola, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Motorola,
Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Motorola, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Also, in our opinion, Motorola, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated
February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.
