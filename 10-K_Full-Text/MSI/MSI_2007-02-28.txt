Business Segments

Motorola reports financial results for the following three
operating business segments:

Mobile Devices Segment

The Mobile Devices segment (“Mobile Devices” or the
“segment”) designs, manufactures, sells and services
wireless handsets with integrated software and accessory
products, and licenses intellectual property. In 2006, the
segment’s net sales represented 66% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.



Principal Products and Services

Our wireless subscriber products include wireless handsets with
related software and accessory products. We also sell and
license our intellectual property. We market our products
worldwide to carriers and consumers through direct sales,
distributors, dealers, retailers and, in certain markets,
through licensees.

Our Industry

We believe that total industry shipments of wireless handsets
(also referred to as industry “sell-in”) increased to
approximately 980 million units in 2006, an increase of
approximately 20% compared to 2005. Demand from new subscribers
was strong in emerging markets, particularly India and China.
Replacement sales in highly-penetrated markets were also strong
due to generally favorable economic conditions, as well as
compelling new handset designs, attractive handset features and
the increased roll-out of high-speed data networks, all creating
a greater opportunity for personalization. In this environment,
we were able to increase our unit shipments faster than the
market and we believe we increased our overall market share to
approximately 22%.

Industry forecasters predict that the wireless handset industry
will continue to grow over the next several years, although the
annual rate of growth is expected to be in the 10% range as
opposed to the annual growth in the 20% range the industry has
experienced over each of the last four years. Continued growth
will be driven by demand from new subscribers in emerging
markets and replacement sales from the current subscriber base.

Our Strategy

The Mobile Devices segment is focused on profitable and
sustainable growth while maintaining a strong commitment to
quality and an unrelenting focus on technology and innovation.
We recognize the role the mobile device plays in digital
convergence by breaking down the boundaries between work, home,
business, entertainment and leisure. A central theme to Mobile
Devices’ strategy is our vision of seamless mobility, which
leverages the trends in digital convergence by enabling the
consumer to enjoy simple, rich, compelling experiences
regardless of environment, device or network.

We continue to invest in our popular MOTORAZR franchise by
refreshing the product line with new designs, cobranding, new
features and network extensions. New flagship additions to the
franchise were introduced in 2006 with the launch of MOTOKRZR
and MOTORIZR Z3, our first quad-band, globally available slider
designed for GSM-based networks. The franchise was expanded into
3G technologies with the launch of MOTORAZR V3x which
earned “Best 3GSM Handset” at the 2006 3GSM World
Congress in February. Further extensions of the franchise into
high-speed downlink packet access (“HSDPA”) were
accomplished with the launch of MOTORAZR xx and MOTORAZR maxx.
We launched the MOTO Q, our first iconic
“qwerty”-based device on North America’s largest
CDMA EV-DO network. We also introduced the MOTOFONE handset, a
value-priced handset that strengthens Motorola’s drive to
connect “the next billion” mobile phone users. Across
technologies, price tiers and geographies, our objective is to
unite “must have” design with “must have”
experiences—without compromising quality of design, quality
of experience or quality of product performance.

We play an active role in the development of next-generation
technologies and believe a strong intellectual property
portfolio is critical to our long-term success. We have a
substantial investment in UMTS, WiMAX and HSDPA technologies and
chipset designs to ensure that we maintain a favorable strategic
position in these emerging technologies. We will continue to
identify opportunities to generate licensing revenue from these
investments.

Our approach to providing rich experiences involves both
partnerships and in-house initiatives. To deliver compelling
experiences to the mobile user in the productivity, imaging and
music categories, it is critical to have the right partners. To
that end, we have partnered with Google, Kodak, Microsoft,
Warner Music, Yahoo! and other leading brands to create simple
and unique rich experiences. Additionally, during 2006, the
segment completed the acquisition of TTP Communications plc, a
developer of intellectual property used in the design and
manufacture of wireless communication terminals and a leading
provider of protocol stack software that offers rapid
customization of handsets through its AJAR applications
framework. In early 2007, Motorola completed the acquisition of
Good Technology, Inc. to strengthen our enterprise-productivity
offering. Good’s

end-to

-end content
delivery platform expands not only our enterprise and prosumer
portfolio but also accelerates the development and richness of
our multimedia offering

Delivering advanced services to consumers requires a
highly-capable software platform with a large base of
development support. In 2006, we continued to invest in our
Linux-based platform. Through the formation of the



LiMo (Linux Mobile) Foundation, Motorola along with other mobile
industry leaders, pledged to create the world’s first
globally adopted open mobile Linux platform. We expect this
platform to provide cost advantages to us, flexibility to
carriers, and access to the world’s community of
application and software developers.

Customers

Mobile Devices continues to focus on strengthening relationships
with our top customers. The segment has several large customers
worldwide, the loss of one or more of which could have a
material adverse effect on the segment’s business.

The largest of the segment’s end customers (including sales
through distributors) are China Mobile, Verizon, Sprint Nextel,
Cingular and

T-Mobile.

Sales to these five largest customers represented approximately
39% of the segment’s net sales in 2006. In addition to
selling directly to carriers and operators, Mobile Devices also
sells products through a variety of third-party distributors and
retailers, which account for approximately 38% of the
segment’s net sales. The largest of these distributors is
Brightstar Corporation.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
largest individual market, many of our customers, and
approximately 65% of our net sales, are outside the
U.S. The largest of these international markets are China,
Brazil, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Hong Kong. Compared to
2005, the segment experienced sales growth in: High Growth
markets (defined as countries in the Middle East, Africa,
Southeast Asia and India), North Asia, North America and Latin
America. Sales grew as a result of an improved product
portfolio, including continued demand worldwide for the MOTORAZR
family, continued strong market growth in emerging markets, and
high replacement sales in more mature markets.

Competition

The segment believes it increased its overall market share to
approximately 22% in 2006 and remains the second-largest
worldwide supplier of wireless handsets. The segment experiences
intense competition in worldwide markets from numerous global
competitors, including some of the world’s largest
companies, such as Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG. The
wireless handset industry continues to consolidate and, in 2006,
the five largest participants together held an aggregate market
share of approximately 86%.

Our strategy of driving our seamless mobility vision, creating
valuable differentiation of our products through design, and
providing compelling, rich experiences to consumers and carriers
is intended to further enhance our market position. Establishing
and expanding a strong position in the fastest-growing segments,
such as emerging markets and 3G/UMTS, will be necessary to
retain and enhance our competitiveness. We also believe that it
is critical to invest in research and development
(“R&D”) of cutting-edge technologies and services
to remain competitive. In 2006, the segment’s total
investment in R&D again increased to support new product
development.

General competitive factors in the market for our products
include: design;

time-to

-market; brand
awareness; technology offered; price; product proposition,
performance, quality, delivery and warranty; the quality and
availability of service; and relationships with key customers.

Payment Terms

The segment’s customers and distributors buy from us
regularly with payment terms that are competitive with current
industry practices. These terms vary globally and generally
range from cash-with-order to 60 days. Extended payment
terms beyond 60 days are provided to customers on a limited
basis. Payment terms allow the customer or distributor to
purchase products from us on a periodic basis and pay for those
products at the end of the agreed term applicable to each
purchase. A customer’s outstanding credit at any point in
time is limited to a predetermined amount as established by
management.

Regulatory Matters

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless
services. The growth of the wireless and personal communications
industry may be affected if adequate frequencies are not
allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are not
developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated
for such use. Industry



growth may also be affected by the cost of the new licenses
required to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation
costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as
WiMAX. Other countries have also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow these and other new technologies,
which can be offered without spectrum license costs.
Deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities
for Motorola and our customers.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2006, compared to $3.0 billion at
December 31, 2005. The 2006 backlog is believed to be
generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be
recognized as revenue in 2007. The forward-looking estimate of
the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may
cause the amount recognized to change. The decrease in backlog
at December 31, 2006, compared to December 31, 2005,
is primarily due to an unusually high level of backlog at
December 31, 2005 resulting from strong customer demand for
new products during the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of which
were unable to be shipped in significant quantities due to
supply constraints for select components.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing
processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third
parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Motorola is
also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty
and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
subject to licenses. The protection of these licenses is also
important to the segment’s operations. Reference is made to
the material under the heading “Other Information” for
additional information relating to patents and trademarks and
research and development activities with respect to this segment.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
inventory in manufacturing and distribution centers in order to
meet customer delivery requirements in a manner consistent with
industry standards. At the end of 2006, the segment had a higher
inventory balance than at the end of 2005. The increase reflects
a growth in inventory in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily
due to slower than expected initial customer demand for certain
products.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
currently source certain materials and components from single
vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Energy necessary for the segment’s manufacturing facilities
consists primarily of electricity and natural gas, which are
currently in generally adequate supply for the segment’s
operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and
freight costs are dependent on world oil prices. A substantial
increase in worldwide oil prices could have a negative impact on
our results of operations. Labor is generally available in
reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing
facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the
aforementioned items or a significant cost increase could affect
the segment’s results.

The segment permits returns under limited circumstances to
remain competitive with current industry practices.

The segment typically experiences higher sales in the fourth
calendar quarter and lower sales in the first calendar quarter
of each year.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Libertyville, Illinois. Our
other major facilities are located in Plantation, Florida;
Flensburg, Germany; Singapore; Beijing and Tianjin, China;
Jaguariuna, Brazil; and Basingstoke, England. We also maintain
an interest in a joint venture in Hangzhou, China.



We also use several electronics manufacturing suppliers
(“EMS”) and original design manufacturers
(“ODM”) to enhance our ability to lower our costs and
deliver products that meet consumer demands in the
rapidly-changing technological environment. A portion of our
handsets are manufactured either completely or substantially by
non-affiliated EMS and ODM manufacturers and the percentage of
total manufactured unit volume with these manufacturers
increased moderately from 2005 to 2006.

In 2006, our handsets were primarily manufactured in Asia. We
expect this to continue in 2007. Our largest manufacturing
facilities are located in China, Singapore and Brazil. Each of
these facilities serves multiple countries and regions of the
world.

Networks and Enterprise Segment

The Networks and Enterprise segment (the “segment”)
designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services:
(i) cellular infrastructure systems and wireless broadband
systems to public carriers and other wireless service providers
(referred to as the “public networks” market), and
(ii) analog and digital two-way radio, voice and data
communications products and systems, as well as wireless
broadband systems, to a wide range of public safety, government,
utility, transportation and other worldwide enterprise markets
(referred to as the “private networks” market). In
January 2007, the segment completed the acquisition of
Symbol Technologies, Inc. (“Symbol”), a leader in
providing products and systems used in end-to-end enterprise
mobility solutions. Symbol will become the cornerstone of the
segment’s enterprise mobility strategy. In 2006, the
segment’s net sales represented 26% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

In the public networks market, the segment provides

end-to

-end cellular
networks, including radio base stations, base station
controllers, associated software and services, application
platforms and third-party switching for CDMA, GSM,
iDEN

®

and UMTS technologies. The segment also offers a portfolio of
products, collectively known as Motorola MOTOwi4, which includes
WiMAX, to create mobile Internet Protocol (“IP”)
broadband access. These technologies, especially WiMAX, have the
potential to make mobile bandwidth more affordable and
accessible for mainstream consumer adoption, yet profitable for
the segment’s service provider customers. The segment also
provides access points, subscriber modules and backhaul modules
for wireless broadband systems, as well as advanced
telecommunications architecture (“TCA”) and micro TCA
communications servers. These products and services are marketed
to wireless service providers worldwide through a direct sales
force, licensees and agents.

In the private networks market, the segment primarily designs,
manufactures, sells, installs and services two-way radio, voice
and data communications products and systems to a wide range of
public safety and government customers worldwide.

The segment also serves the enterprise space by providing
business-critical wireless mobility devices, networks and
applications that enable an enterprise customer to seamlessly
connect its people, assets and information. Enterprise customers
include utility, courier, transportation, field services and
other companies with disseminated workforces. Offerings include
mobile office devices, rugged mobile computing handhelds,
private and public business communication networks,
enterprise-grade wireless security systems, and

end-to

-end systems and
applications that deliver enterprise mobility. The January 2007
acquisition of Symbol unites the two companies’
industry-leading enterprise products.

The segment’s products are sold directly through its own
distribution force or through independent authorized
distributors and dealers, service operators and independent
commission sales representatives. The segment’s
distribution organization provides systems engineering and
installation and other technical and systems management services
to meet its customers’ particular needs. The customer may
also choose to install and maintain the equipment with its own
employees, or may obtain installation, service and parts from a
network of the segment’s authorized service stations (most
of whom are also authorized dealers) or from other non-Motorola
service stations.



Our Industry

We participate in multiple global markets within the mobile
segment of the communications industry, providing wireless
equipment and services to public carriers and other wireless
service providers, as well as public safety, government and
enterprise customers.

Within our public networks market, we primarily provide radio
access cellular infrastructure systems. This market grew
approximately 5% in 2006, compared to 10% in 2005 and we expect
this market to experience flat to low single digit growth in
2007. We are also an early leader in the emerging market for
next-generation wireless broadband networks, including WiMAX
technology.

The majority of installed cellular infrastructure systems are
based upon CDMA, GSM, UMTS and iDEN technologies. We supply
systems based on each of these technologies and are the sole
supplier of proprietary iDEN networks. Advanced infrastructure
systems based on these technologies include GPRS, CDMA-1X and
EDGE. In addition, some segments of the cellular infrastructure
industry have installed, or are in the process of migrating to,
third-generation (“3G”) networks, which are
high-capacity radio access wireless networks providing enhanced
data services, improved Internet access and increased voice
capacity. The primary 3G technologies are W-CDMA (based on
either UMTS or Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access
(“FOMA”) technologies) and CDMA2000 1xEVDO. An
additional 3G technology standard is TD-SCDMA, driven primarily
by the Chinese government and local Chinese vendors. We now
expect 3G licenses to be awarded in China during 2008. We supply
systems based on UMTS and CDMA 2000 1xEVDO technologies.
Advanced infrastructure systems based on 3G technologies include
high-speed downlink packet access (“HSDPA”) and
high-speed uplink packet access (“HSUPA”). Commercial
service of 3G technologies was first introduced in Asia and has
expanded to Western Europe and North America.

Industry standards bodies are in the process of defining the
next generation of wireless broadband systems after 3G. The
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(“IEEE”) is currently developing fixed and mobile
broadband standards (802.16d and 802.16e) based on orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (“OFDM”) technology,
which offer systems performance utilizing wider channels
enabling triple play services (voice, data, video). Based upon
developments in the 802.16e standard, we expect to see the WiMAX
market begin to materialize in 2008 as several WiMAX networks
come on-line and devices utilizing these networks become widely
available. We are an early leader in next-generation wireless
broadband products, including WiMAX technology.

The International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) is
also developing next-generation cellular wireless access
standards (“4G”) for the cellular infrastructure
industry, also anticipated to be based upon OFDM technology.

Within our private networks business, homeland security remains
an important issue at the local, state and national levels. We
expect this industry to grow in the

mid-to

-high single
digit percentage range in 2007, consistent with industry growth
in 2006. We provide solutions for each of the major standards
based private network technologies, APCO (Association for Public
Safety Communications Officials) 25 and TETRA (terrestrial
trunked radio). We expect product sales to continue to grow
worldwide as demand for intersystem, interoperable public safety
communications grows. As both technologies mature, better
frequency utilization has increased the demand and potential for
data applications and we expect to see increased demand for
data-based products in 2007 and beyond.

In addition, Motorola recognizes a significant market
opportunity in the next several years as enterprises increase
their deployment of mobile technologies. The enterprise markets
in which Motorola competes include enterprise wireless
infrastructure, mobile computing solutions, bar code scanning,
radio frequency identification (“RFID”) solutions and
mobile management platforms. Organizations that are looking to
increase productivity and derive benefits from mobilizing their
applications and workforce are driving the enterprise mobility
market. We expect the overall enterprise mobility market to grow
in the high single digits in 2007. With the completion of the
Symbol acquisition in January 2007, Motorola’s new
enterprise mobility business offers a broad device portfolio
which will enable us to compete more effectively in these
markets.

Our Strategy

The Networks and Enterprise segment is executing on a strategy
to become a category leader in next-generation mobile solutions,
thereby enabling seamless mobility for public carriers and their
customers, governments and enterprises. It executes on this
strategy by offering multiple technologies across several
customer sectors.



Public Networks.

The segment is investing to be the
leader in next-generation wireless broadband technologies with
its MOTOwi4 portfolio of offerings, such as WiMAX. Because of
its projected early availability, lower cost and superior
performance, wireless broadband technology, such as WiMAX, based
on the IEEE standard 802.16e represents a compelling offering
for existing and new providers. Potential customers in this
space range from traditional mobile providers to wireline
operators, such as cable companies, who are moving to enhance
their offerings to new customers or launch offerings based on
wireless broadband. In 2006, the segment announced arrangements
for WiMAX networks based on 802.16e technologies with Wateen
Telecom in Pakistan and Sprint Nextel and Clearwire in the
United States. In addition, at the end of 2006 the segment was
participating in 22 WiMAX trials globally.

The segment also has a comprehensive investment strategy to
migrate its customers from 2G (second-generation) to
next-generation wireless technologies, including 3G
(third-generation) technologies. The cellular network
technologies, based on protocols developed through the ITU, have
advanced from 2G to 3G enabling service providers to move to
higher-capacity bandwidth technologies which enable the
providers to offer engaging, new and exciting applications that
can broaden their revenue stream. Many cellular operators,
particularly in emerging markets, have not begun their migration
to next-generation access technologies. In 2006, the segment
announced a collaboration with Huawei Technologies, Co., Ltd. to
bring an enhanced and extensive portfolio of UMTS and
HSDPA/HSUPA infrastructure equipment to customers worldwide.

Private Networks.

The segment is the leading provider of
mission-critical systems worldwide, with more than 65 years
of experience in custom, rugged devices; public safety-grade
private networks; sophisticated encryption technology;
interoperable voice and broadband data; and complex network
design, optimization and implementation. Key elements in the
segment’s strategy include: (i) providing
next-generation integrated voice, data and broadband over
wireless systems at the local, state and national levels;
(ii) continuing to invest in the ongoing migration from
analog to digital

end-to

-end radio
systems; (iii) providing APCO 25 and TETRA standards-based
voice and data networking systems around the world; and
(iv) implementing interoperable communications and
information systems, especially related to global homeland
security. In January 2007, the segment completed the acquisition
of Symbol, a leader in designing, developing, manufacturing and
servicing products and systems used in

end-to

-end enterprise
mobility solutions. Symbol’s offerings feature rugged
mobile computing, advanced data capture, RFID, wireless
infrastructure and mobility management. Recognized as an
industry leader in technology innovation, with a world-class
product portfolio and valuable intellectual property, Symbol
will be the cornerstone of the segment’s strategy to enable
the mobile enterprise in 2007 and beyond. The acquisition unites
the two companies’ adjacent assets, expertise, customer
bases, supplier bases and industry-leading products. Key
elements in the segment’s enterprise mobility strategy
include offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and
services to help businesses: (i) streamline their supply
chains, (ii) improve customer service in the field,
(iii) increase data collection accuracy, and
(iv) enhance worker productivity.

Customers

Due to the nature of the segment’s business, many of the
agreements we enter into are long-term contracts that require
sizeable investments by our customers. In 2006, sales to our top
five commercial customers (Sprint Nextel; KDDI, a service
provider in Japan; China Mobile; Verizon; and Alltel), plus the
U.S. government and its public safety agencies, represented
approximately 34% of the segment’s net sales. The loss of
any of the segment’s large customers, in particular these
customers, could have a material adverse effect on the
segment’s business. Further, because many of these
contracts are long-term, the loss of a major customer would
impact revenue and earnings over several quarters.

Sprint Nextel is our largest customer and the segment has been
Sprint Nextel’s sole supplier of iDEN network
infrastructure equipment for more than ten years. Sprint Nextel
uses Motorola’s proprietary iDEN technology to support a
critical part of its nationwide wireless service business.
Motorola is currently operating under supply agreements for iDEN
infrastructure equipment that cover the period from
January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The
segment’s iDEN revenues decreased in 2006 compared to 2005,
and we expect iDEN sales to decline further in 2007.

Competition

The segment experiences widespread competition from numerous
competitors, ranging from some of the world’s largest
diversified companies to foreign, state-owned telecommunications
companies to many small, specialized firms. In the public
networks industry, Ericsson is the market leader, followed by
Nokia and four



vendors with similar market share positions, including Motorola,
Siemens, Alcatel-Lucent and Nortel. Samsung, NEC and local
Chinese vendors are also significant competitors. In the private
networks industry, the segment provides communications and
information systems compliant with both existing industry
digital standards, TETRA and APCO 25. Major competitors include:
M/ A-Com, EADS Telecommunications, Kenwood, EF Johnson and large
system integrators. The segment may also act as a subcontractor
to a large system integrator based on a number of competitive
factors and customer requirements. As demand for
fully-integrated voice, data and broadband over wireless systems
at the local, state and national government levels continues,
the segment may face additional competition from public
telecommunications carriers. In the enterprise market, the
segment experiences competition from Cisco, Nokia, and Intermec.

Competitive factors in the market for the segment’s
products include: technology offered; price; payment terms;
availability of vendor financing; product and system
performance; product features, quality, delivery, availability
and warranty; the quality and availability of service; company
image; relationship with key customers; and

time-to

-market. Price
is a major area of competition and often impacts margins for
initial system bids, particularly in emerging markets.

Time-to

-market has also
been an important competitive factor, especially for new systems
and technologies.

The segment’s public networks business is confronting
several factors that could impact its business, including the
consolidation among telecommunications equipment providers and
unclear timing for the granting of new licenses for providers in
countries like China. In addition, the segment does not believe
future iDEN technology revenues are likely to match 2006 levels.
In the private networks space, the segment is managing the
impact of system integrators seeking to move farther into the
public safety area. In the enterprise market, a number of
competitors deliver products in certain segments of the
enterprise mobility market. The segment believes it has a unique
portfolio to seamlessly connect people, assets and information
to enable customers to grow their business, increase efficiency
and improve customer satisfaction. Security and manageability
are common throughout the portfolio.

Payment Terms

Payment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement.
Contracts for communication systems typically include
implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation and
system acceptance, which can take 30 to 180 days to
complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on the completion
of the milestone. Customer payments are generally due 30 to
60 days from the invoice date.

As required for competitive reasons, we may provide or work with
third-party lenders to arrange for long-term financing in
connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or
a portion of the purchase price. The segment’s payment
terms are consistent with industry practice as many of our
contracts are awarded through a competitive bid process.

Regulatory Matters

The use of wireless voice and data communications systems is
regulated by a variety of governmental and other regulatory
agencies throughout the world. In the U.S., non-Federal users of
these systems are licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission (“FCC”), which has broad authority to make
rules and regulations and prescribe restrictions and conditions
to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934.
Similarly, Federal agency operation of wireless communications
systems is regulated by the National Telecommunications and
Information Agency (“NTIA”). Regulatory agencies in
other countries have similar types of authority. Consequently,
the business and results of this segment could be affected by
the rules and regulations adopted by the FCC, NTIA or regulatory
agencies in other countries from time to time. Motorola has
developed products using trunking and data communications
technologies to enhance spectral efficiencies. The growth and
results of the wireless communications industry may be affected
by the regulations of the FCC, NTIA or other regulatory agencies
relating to the access to allocated spectrum for wireless
communications users, especially in urban areas where spectrum
is heavily used.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
systems, such as WiFi, mesh technologies and wide area network
systems, such as Motorola’s Wi4 portfolio, including WiMAX.
Other countries have also deregulated portions of the available
spectrum to allow the deployment of these and other
technologies. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new
opportunities for Motorola and our customers.



In early 2005, Sprint Nextel agreed to a plan by federal
regulators designed to address interference from iDEN phones
with hundreds of public safety communications systems in the
U.S. According to the FCC, the agreement should
dramatically reduce the likelihood of interference. Sprint
Nextel is required to fund certain costs necessary to relocate
those impacted users onto alternate channels in the 800MHz
spectrum. Motorola will continue to work with our customers that
are impacted by this plan and expects that this will have a
neutral to positive impact on the segment’s business over
the next several years. However, the short-term impact remains
uncertain and is yet to be quantified, as the plan is still
being implemented throughout most of the country.

In February 2006, federal legislation was adopted setting
February 17, 2009 as the date by which a portion of the
spectrum historically used for broadcast television must be
cleared throughout the U.S. Segments of this spectrum have
been designated for public safety use and other segments for
commercial operations, both market segments in which Motorola
participates. This spectrum was designated for public safety and
commercial use in 1997, however, prior to this new legislation,
there was no certainty as to when it actually would be cleared
for use in major markets. Clearing broadcast television from
this band will significantly increase the spectrum public safety
and commercial entities have available for communications
systems. The new spectrum is configured to support both voice
and data and the FCC has also opened additional rulemaking
proceedings to help enable future broadband operations for
public safety. Motorola already has public safety infrastructure
and mobiles/portables shipping for deployment of voice and data
systems in this band and we anticipate the availability of
broadband equipment in the future.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $4.4 billion as of
December 31, 2006, compared to $4.1 billion as of
December 31, 2005. The 2006 order backlog is believed to be
generally firm and approximately 85% of that amount is expected
to be recognized as revenue during 2007. The forward-looking
estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future
events that may cause the amount recognized to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s
operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents
relating to its products, systems, technologies and
manufacturing processes.

The segment licenses some of its patents to third parties and
generates modest revenue from these licenses. Motorola is also
licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and
licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the
terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products
subject to licenses. Reference is made to the material under the
heading “Other Information” for information relating
to patents and trademarks and research and development
activities with respect to this segment.

We actively participate in the development of open standards for
interoperable, mission-critical digital two-way radio systems.
We have published our technology and licensed patents to
signatories of the industry’s two primary memorandums of
understanding defined by the Telecommunications Industry
Association (“TIA”) Project 25 and European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (“ETSI”)
Terrestrial Trunked Radio (“TETRA”). Royalties
associated with these licenses are not expected to be material
to the segment’s financial results.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a
manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2006,
the segment had a higher inventory balance than at the end of
2005, primarily due to a larger amount of inventory to fulfill
longer-term projects.

Our private networks business provides custom products based on
assembling basic units into a large variety of models or
combinations. This requires the stocking of inventories and
large varieties of piece parts and replacement parts, as well as
a variety of basic level assemblies in order to meet delivery
requirements. Relatively short delivery requirements and
historical trends determine the amounts of inventory to be
stocked. To the extent suppliers’ product life cycles are
shorter than the segment’s, stocking of lifetime buy
inventories is required. In addition, replacement parts are
stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery
cycle.



Availability of materials and components required by the segment
is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
currently source certain materials and components from single
vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the
primary sources of energy for the segment’s operations,
which are currently in generally adequate supply for the
segment’s operations. In addition, the cost to operate our
facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices.
A substantial increase in worldwide oil prices could have a
negative impact on our results of operations. Labor is generally
available in reasonable proximity to the segment’s
manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any
of these items or a significant cost increase could affect the
segment’s results.

Generally the segment’s contracts do not include a right of
return, other than for standard warranty provisions. For new
product introductions, we may enter into milestone contracts
providing that the product could be returned if we do not
achieve the milestones.

Due to government buying patterns, private networks sales tend
to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter. The business does
not have seasonal patterns in the public networks market.

Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Arlington Heights, Illinois.
Major design, integration, manufacturing and distribution
centers are located in: Arlington Heights and Schaumburg,
Illinois; Chandler and Tempe, Arizona; Fort Worth, Texas;
Swindon, England; Arad, Israel; Hangzhou and Tianjin, China;
Munich, Taunusstein and Berlin, Germany; and Penang, Malaysia.
In addition to our own manufacturing, we utilize EMS
manufacturers, primarily in Asia, in order to enhance our
ability to lower costs and deliver products that meet consumer
demands.

Connected Home Solutions Segment

The Connected Home Solutions segment (the “segment”)
designs, manufactures, sells and services: (i) cable
television, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and
broadcast network set-top boxes (“digital entertainment
devices”),
(ii)

end-to

-end
digital video system solutions, (iii) broadband access
networks, and
(iv)

IP-based

data
and voice products (including modems). In 2006, the
segment’s net sales represented 8% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.

Principal Products and Services

The segment is a leading provider of

end-to

-end networks
used for the delivery of video, voice and data services over
hybrid fiber coaxial networks. We also provide products for IP
television (“IPTV”) — multichannel
television service using

IP-based

fiber-to

-the premises
and

fiber-to

-the-node
access networks — to wireline carriers.

Our products are marketed primarily to cable television
operators, satellite television programmers, telephone carriers
and other communications providers worldwide and are sold
primarily by our skilled sales personnel. We have also expanded
our traditional distribution channels by selling directly to
consumers in a variety of retail markets. Through retail, we
market and sell primarily cable modems and cordless telephones.

Our Industry

Demand for our products depends primarily on: (i) capital
spending by providers of broadband services for constructing,
rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems, and
(ii) the marketing of advanced communications services by
those providers. The amount of spending by these providers, and
therefore a majority of our sales and profitability, are
affected by a variety of factors, including: (i) the
continuing trend of consolidation within the cable and
telecommunications industries, (ii) the financial condition
of cable television system operators and alternative
communications providers, including their access to financing,
(iii) the rate of digital penetration,
(iv) technological developments, (v) standardization
efforts that impact the deployment of new equipment,
(vi) new legislation and regulations affecting the
equipment sold by the segment, and (vii) general economic
conditions. In 2006, the business benefited from increased
spending by cable television operators on our products, due to
the increase in digital video and data subscribers and the
deployment of advanced video platforms by cable operators for
high-definition television (“HD”) and digital video
recording (“DVR”) (together “HD/



DVR”) applications, as well as from spending by telephone
companies upgrading their networks and adding video services.

Our Strategy

The Connected Home Solutions segment is focused on becoming the
global leader in broadband connected home solutions and
services, enabling customers to be seamlessly informed,
connected and entertained. Key elements in the segment’s
strategy include: (i) providing for convergence of services
and applications across delivery platforms within the home and
across mobile applications, (ii) innovating and enhancing
our end-to-end network portfolio, and (iii) developing new
services that leverage our platforms.

We are focused on accelerating the rate of digital penetration
by broadband operators in North America through the introduction
of an enhanced suite of digital set-top boxes. Our product
offerings include more cost-effective products designed to
increase the number of set-top boxes per household, as well as
higher-end products for advanced services, including supporting
the growing HD/ DVR markets. During 2006, we shipped our
50 millionth digital entertainment device for broadband
cable networks, approximately 10 years after shipment of
our first such device.

We are capitalizing upon the introduction of IPTV by
telecommunication operators to their subscribers with products
that support delivery of video content using both
copper-outside-plant and fiber-to-the-premises
(“FTTP”) networks. During the year, the segment
provided end-to-end video equipment and FTTP access network
equipment for the launch of Verizon’s FiOS service and is
supplying IP interactive set-top boxes to leading
telecommunication companies around the world, including
AT&T, Telefonica S.A., KPN International, Lyse Energi AS,
and ViaSat, Inc.

We are expanding our position in end-to-end video networks as
well as increasing our offerings to wireline carriers through
several strategic acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired Kreatel
Communications AB to enhance our portfolio of IPTV set-top boxes
and software and extend our customer relationships with leading
IPTV providers in Europe. We grew our presence in the video core
network through the acquisitions of: (i) Broadbus
Technologies, Inc., a leading supplier of content-on-demand
technologies, also called video on demand (“VOD”), and
(ii) Vertasent LLC, a software developer for managing
technology elements for switched digital video networks. In
February 2007, we completed the acquisition of Netopia, Inc.
(“Netopia”), a leading provider of data gateways and
subscriber equipment management technology. We also announced
our intention to acquire Tut Systems, Inc. (“Tut
Systems”), a leading developer of edge routing and video
encoders. Together, Netopia and Tut Systems will enhance our
position with global carriers as they deploy advanced services.
We expect these acquisitions to: (i) enhance our capability
to provide complete solutions to cable television operators as
they grow their on-demand content offerings and deploy switched
digital video (“SDV”) technology, which delivers
programming only when and where requested by subscribers versus
delivering programming to all subscribers all the time, and
(ii) provide end-to-end video solutions to telephone
companies as they add video to their service offerings.

We are focused on enhancing and expanding our voice and data
offerings to offer end-to-end solutions for fixed-mobile
convergence and next-generation converged IP-based voice, data
and video delivery. These solutions include:
(i) stand-alone and integrated voice/data/ WiFi gateways
with support for handing off a mobile voice or data call to a
WiFi access point and a carrier’s VoIP network, and
(ii) next-generation infrastructure products in the cable
modem termination system (“CMTS”) and fiber optic
network markets which expand the bandwidth delivered to a home
or business. We introduced our first seamless mobility voice
gateway in 2006, which enables our customers to support handoff
of voice traffic between wireline networks and wireless networks
using dual mode handsets.

We also continue to focus on growing our business in regions
outside of North America, including the development of digital
video products compliant with technology required in these
regions. During 2006, the segment launched digital video in
Argentina with Cablevision; launched video on demand in the
Netherlands with UPC; and provided video set-top boxes to a
number of operators in China. Although sales in North America
accounted for 83% of the segment’s sales in 2006, shipments
to markets outside North America have grown over 60% the last
three years.



Customers

The vast majority of our sales are in the U.S., where a small
number of large cable television multiple system operators
(“MSOs”) own a large portion of the cable systems and
account for a significant portion of the total capital spending
in the industry. We are dependent upon a small number of
customers for a significant portion of our sales. Comcast
Corporation (“Comcast”) accounted for approximately
29% of the segment’s net sales in 2006. Collectively, our
five largest customers represented 54% of the segment’s net
sales in 2006. The loss of business in the future from Comcast
or any of the other major MSOs could have a material adverse
effect on the segment’s business. Sales of video headend
equipment and set-top boxes to telephone carriers accounted for
approximately 11% of our revenue in 2006. The opportunity in
this market segment is expected to continue to grow as carriers
around the world expand to offer video services.

Competition

The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. The
rapid technological changes occurring in each of the markets in
which we compete are expected to lead to the entry of many new
competitors. Competitive factors for our products and systems
include: technology offered; product and system performance;
features; quality; delivery and availability; and price. We
believe that we enjoy a strong competitive position because of
our strong relationships with major communication system
operators worldwide, technological leadership and new product
development capabilities.

We compete worldwide in the market for digital set-top boxes for
broadband and satellite networks. Based on 2006 annual sales, we
believe we are the leading provider of digital cable set-top
boxes in North America. Our digital cable set-top boxes compete
with products from a number of different companies, including:
(i) those that develop and sell products that are
distributed by direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”)
service providers through retail channels, (ii) those that
develop, manufacture and sell products of their own design, and
(iii) those that license technology from us or other
competitors. In North America, our largest competitor is Cisco,
which completed the acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta in 2006.
Other competitors in North America include ARRIS, Harmonic and

C-COR.

Outside of North
America, where we have a smaller market position, we compete
with many equipment suppliers, including several consumer
electronics companies.

The traditional competitive environment in the North American
cable market continues to evolve. As further described below,
the FCC has enacted regulations requiring separation of security
functionality from set-top boxes by July 1, 2007 to
increase competition and encourage the sale of set-top boxes in
the retail market. To meet this requirement, we have developed
security modules for sale to cable operators for use with our
own and third-party set-top boxes. As a step towards this
implementation, in 2002, the cable industry and consumer
electronic manufacturers agreed to a uni-directional security
interface that allows third-party devices to access broadcast
programming (not pay-per-view or VOD) with a security device.
These devices became widely available in 2004 and to date have
seen limited use. The limited use of the devices has not had a
significant impact on our business. A full two-way security
interface specification continues to be refined. These changes
are expected to increase competition and encourage the sale of
set-top boxes to consumers in the retail market. Traditionally,
cable service providers have leased the set-top box to their
customers.

We also compete worldwide in the market for broadband data and
voice products. We believe that we are the leading provider of
cable modems worldwide, competing with a number of consumer
electronic companies and various original design manufacturers
worldwide.

Payment Terms

Generally, our payment terms are consistent with the industry
and range from 30 to 60 days in North America, and are
typically limited to 90 days in regions outside North
America. Extended payment terms are provided to customers from
time to time on a limited basis. Such extended terms are
isolated in nature and historically have not related to a
significant portion of our revenues.

Regulatory Matters

Many of our products are subject to regulation by the FCC or
other communications regulatory agencies. In addition, our
customers and their networks, into which our products are
incorporated, are subject to government regulation. Government
regulatory policies affecting either the willingness or the
ability of cable operators and



telephone carriers to offer certain services, or the terms on
which the companies offer the services and conduct their
business, may affect the segment’s results.

Currently, reception of digital television programming from the
cable broadband network requires a set-top box with certain
technology. This security technology has limited the
availability of set-top boxes to those manufactured by a few
cable network manufacturers, including Motorola. The FCC has
enacted regulations requiring separation of security
functionality from set-top boxes to increase competition and
encourage the sale of set-top boxes in the retail market by
July 1, 2007. Traditionally, cable service providers sold
or leased the set-top box to their customer. As the retail
market develops for set-top boxes and televisions capable of
accepting the security modules, sales of our set-top boxes may
be negatively impacted. In addition, we risk lost sales if
competitors bring set-top boxes with separable security to
market before we do.

Backlog

The segment’s backlog was $792 million at
December 31, 2006, compared to $430 million at
December 31, 2005. The increase in backlog and related
orders primarily reflects increased orders from our customers
for digital and HD/DVR set-top boxes. The 2006 order backlog is
believed to be generally firm and 100% of that amount is
expected to be recognized as revenue in 2007. The
forward-looking estimates of the firmness of such orders is
subject to future events, which may cause the amount recognized
to change.

Intellectual Property Matters

We seek to build upon our core enabling technologies, such as
digital compression, encryption and conditional access systems,
in order to lead worldwide growth in the market for broadband
communications networks. Our policy is to protect our
proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and
foreign patent applications to protect technology and
improvements that we consider important to the development of
our business. We also rely on our proprietary knowledge and
ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our
competitive position, and will periodically seek to include our
proprietary technologies in certain patent pools that support
the implementation of standards. We were a founder of MPEG LA,
the patent licensing authority established to foster broad
deployment of MPEG-2 compliant systems. We have also licensed
our digital conditional access technology,
DigiCipher(R) II, to other equipment suppliers and have
formed joint ventures with Comcast for development and licensing
of conditional access technology. We also enter into other
license agreements, both as licensor and licensee, covering
certain products and processes with various companies. These
license agreements require the payment of certain royalties that
are not expected to be material to the segment’s financial
results.

Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality

The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of
inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a
manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2006,
the segment had higher inventory balances than at the end of
2005 due to the timing of transitions to EMS manufacturers and
business acquisitions.

Availability of materials and components required by the segment
is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market
demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We
currently source certain materials and components from single
vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Electricity is the primary source of energy required for our
manufacturing operations, which is currently in generally
adequate supply for the segments operations. In addition, the
cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent
on world oil prices. A substantial increase in world-wide oil
prices could have a negative impact on our results of
operations. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity
to the segment’s manufacturing facilities. However,
difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned items or a
significant cost increase could affect the segment’s
results.

Generally, we do not permit customers to return products, other
than for standard warranty provisions. We have not recently
experienced seasonal buying patterns for our products. However,
as our retail cable modem and digital set-top box sales
increase, we may have increased sales during the holiday season
at the end of each year.



Our Facilities/ Manufacturing

Our headquarters are located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. We have
several offices throughout North America, Europe, Latin America
and Asia, and we operate manufacturing facilities in Taipei,
Taiwan and Nogales, Mexico. We also use contract manufacturers,
primarily in China, for a portion of our cable modem/voice
module production in order to enhance our ability to lower our
costs and deliver products that meet consumer demand. The amount
of this activity has increased slightly throughout 2006 and is
projected to increase further in future years.

Other Information

2006 Change in Organizational Structure.

Effective as of
the second quarter of 2006, the automotive electronics business
was presented as a discontinued operation and the segments were
realigned into three operating business groups: (i) Mobile
Devices, (ii) Networks and Enterprise, and
(iii) Connected Home Solutions.

Financial Information About Segments.

The response to
this section of Item 1 incorporates by reference
Note 11, “Information by Segment and Geographic
Region,” of Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data of this document.

Customers.

Motorola has several large customers, the loss
of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on
the Company. Motorola’s largest end customers (including
sales through distributors) are Sprint Nextel, China Mobile,
Verizon, Cingular and

T-Mobile.

No single
customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net
sales in 2006.

Approximately 1% of Motorola’s net sales in 2006 were to
various branches and agencies, including the armed services, of
the U.S. Government. All contracts with the
U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the
convenience of the Government.

Government contractors, including Motorola, are routinely
subjected to numerous audits and investigations, which may be
either civil or criminal in nature. The consequences of these
audits and investigations may include administrative action to
suspend business dealings with the contractor and to exclude it
from receiving new business. In addition, Motorola, like other
contractors, reviews aspects of its government contracting
operations, and, where appropriate, takes corrective actions and
makes voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Government. These
audits and investigations could adversely affect Motorola’s
ability to obtain new business from the U.S. Government.

Backlog.

Motorola’s aggregate backlog position for
all Motorola segments, as of the end of the last two fiscal
years was approximately as follows:

December 31, 2006

$6.6 billion

December 31, 2005

$7.5 billion

Except as previously discussed in this Item 1, the orders
supporting the 2006 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table
are believed to be generally firm, and approximately 90% of the
backlog on hand at December 31, 2006 is expected to be
recognized as revenue in 2007. The forward-looking estimate of
the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may
cause the amount recognized to change.

Research and Development.

Motorola’s business
segments participate in very competitive industries with
constant changes in technology. Throughout its history, Motorola
has relied, and continues to rely, primarily on its research and
development (“R&D”) programs for the development
of new products, and on its production engineering capabilities
for the improvement of existing products. Technical data and
product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola’s
business segments on a regular basis. Management believes,
looking forward, that Motorola’s commitment to R&D
programs, both to improve existing products and services and to
develop new products and services, together with its utilization
of

state-of

-the-art
technology, should allow each of its segments to remain
competitive.

R&D expenditures relating to new product development or
product improvement were $4.1 billion in 2006, compared to
$3.6 billion in 2005 and $3.3 billion in 2004. R&D
expenditures increased 14% in 2006 as compared to 2005, after
increasing 9% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Motorola continues to
believe that a strong commitment



to research and development is required to drive long-term
growth. Approximately 27,000 professional employees were engaged
in such research activities during 2006.

Patents and Trademarks.

Motorola seeks to obtain patents
and trademarks to protect our proprietary position whenever
possible and practical. As of December 31, 2006, Motorola
owned approximately 8,652 utility and design patents in the U.S.
and 12,024 patents in foreign countries. These foreign patents
are mostly counterparts of Motorola’s U.S. patents,
but a number result from research conducted outside the U.S. and
are originally filed in the country of origin. During 2006,
Motorola was granted 735 U.S. utility and design patents.
The numbers of patents reported exclude patents sold to
Continental AG in its acquisition of the automotive electronics
business and include patents assigned to companies acquired by
Motorola during 2006. Many of the patents owned by Motorola are
used in its operations or licensed for use by others, and
Motorola is licensed to use certain patents owned by others.
Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are
subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the
products subject to licenses.

Environmental Quality.

Compliance with federal, state and
local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment, has no material effect on capital expenditures,
earnings or the competitive position of Motorola.

Employees.

At December 31, 2006, there were
approximately 66,000 employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries,
as compared to approximately 69,000 employees at
December 31, 2005.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

We wish to caution the reader that the following important
risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this
report or our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document
and elsewhere.

The demand for our products depends in large part on the
    continued growth of the industries in which we participate. A
    market decline in any one of these industries could have an
    adverse effect on our business.

The rate at which the portions of the telecommunications
industry in which we participate continue to grow is critical to
our ability to improve our overall financial performance and we
could be negatively impacted by a slowdown. Our business was
very negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and the
corresponding reduction in capital spending by the
telecommunications industry from 2001 to 2003.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world
    and, as a result, we face risks that other companies that are
    not global may not face.

Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and
more than half of our net sales are made to customers outside of
the U.S. In addition, we have many manufacturing,
administrative and sales facilities outside the U.S. and more
than half of our employees are employed outside the
U.S. Most of our suppliers are outside the U.S. and most of
our products are manufactured outside the U.S.

As with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations
outside the U.S., we are exposed to risks that could negatively
impact sales or profitability, including but not limited to:
(1) tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes;
(2) regulations related to customs and import/export
matters; (3) longer payment cycles; (4) tax issues,
such as tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to
country and as compared to the U.S., and difficulties in
repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient
manner; (5) currency fluctuations, particularly in the
Euro, Chinese renminbi and Brazilian real; (6) foreign
exchange regulations, which may limit the Company’s ability
to convert or repatriate foreign currency; (7) challenges
in collecting accounts receivable; (8) cultural and
language differences; (9) employment regulations and local
labor conditions; (10) difficulties protecting IP in
foreign countries; (11) instability in economic or
political conditions, including inflation, recession and actual
or anticipated military or political conflicts;
(12) natural disasters; (13) public health issues or
outbreaks; and (14) the impact of each of the foregoing on
our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

Many of our products that are manufactured outside of the
U.S. are manufactured in Asia. In particular, we have
sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing
operations, and 11% of our net sales are made to customers in
China. The legal system in China is still developing and is
subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for
products in China could be adversely impacted by changes to or
interpretation of Chinese law. Further, if manufacturing in the
region is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly
reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted.

We also are increasing our presence and/or selling more of our
products in emerging markets such as India and Russia. We face
challenges in emerging markets, including creating demand for
our products and the negative impact of changes in the laws, or
the interpretation of the laws, in those countries.

If the quality of our products does not meet our
    customers’ expectations, then our sales and operating
    earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be adversely
    affected.

Occasionally, some of the products we sell have quality issues
resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from
the software used in the product. These issues may be caused by
the components we purchase from other manufacturers. Often these
issues are identified prior to the shipment of the products and
may cause delays in shipping products to customers, or even the
cancellation of orders by customers. Sometimes, we discover
quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to
our distributors or end-user customers, requiring us to resolve
such issues in a timely manner that is the least disruptive to
our customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment quality
issues can have legal and financial ramifications, including:
delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future
orders, customer-imposed penalties on Motorola for failure to
meet contractual requirements, increased costs associated with
repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our
goodwill and brand name reputation.



In some cases, if the quality issue affects the product’s
safety or regulatory compliance, then such a
“defective” product may need to be recalled. Depending
on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the
field, it can cause the Company to incur substantial recall
costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential
loss of future orders, and the damage to the Company’s
goodwill or brand/reputation. In addition, the Company may be
required, under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for
failed performance that might exceed the revenue that the
Company receives from the contracts. Recalls involving
regulatory agencies can also result in fines and additional
costs. Finally, recalls can result in third-party litigation,
including class action litigation by persons alleging common
harm resulting from the purchase of the products.

We operate in highly-competitive markets and our financial
    results will be affected if we are not able to compete
    effectively.

The markets for our products are highly competitive with respect
to, among other factors: pricing, product and service quality,
and the time required to introduce new products and services.
The markets for many of our products are characterized by
rapidly changing technologies, frequent new product
introductions, short product life cycles and evolving industry
standards. We are constantly exposed to the risk that our
competitors may implement new technologies before we do, or may
offer lower prices, additional products or services or other
incentives that we cannot or will not offer. We can give no
assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against
existing or future competitors.

The uncertainty of current economic and political conditions
    makes budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce demand
    for our products.

Current conditions in the domestic and global economies are
uncertain. The U.S. involvement in Iraq and other global
conflicts, including in the Middle East, as well as public
health issues, have created many economic and political
uncertainties that have impacted the global economy. As a
result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the
world economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate
growth in various parts of the world economy, including the
markets in which we participate. Because all components of our
budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth
in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the
prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future
income and expenditures difficult.

We have sizable manufacturing operations and engineering
resources in Israel that could be disrupted as a result of
hostilities in the region. We also sell our products and
services throughout the Middle East and demand for our products
and services could be negatively impacted by hostilities.

The future direction of the overall domestic and global
economies will have a significant impact on our overall
performance. The potential for future terrorist attacks,
increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing
conflicts and public health issues has created worldwide
uncertainties that have negatively impacted, and may continue to
negatively impact, demand for certain of our products.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to
    purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components
    to meet the demands of our customers.

Our ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on
our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality
materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We have
experienced shortages in the past that have adversely affected
our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to
avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurances that
we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore,
certain of our components are available only from a single
source or limited sources. We may not be able to diversify
sources in a timely manner. A reduction or interruption in
supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies
could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

Our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new
    products and technologies and our results can be impacted by our
    significant investments in new products and technologies.

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly
changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, short
product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Our success
depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful
introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to
comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing
technological and product developments carried out by our



competitors. The research and development of new,
technologically-advanced products is a complex and uncertain
process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the
accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may
focus our resources on technologies that do not become widely
accepted and are not commercially viable. In addition, products
may contain defects or errors that are detected only after
deployment. If our products are not competitive or do not work
properly, our business will suffer.

Our results are subject to risks related to our significant
investment in developing and introducing new products, such as:
seamless mobility products; advanced wireless handsets; WiMAX
and other advanced technologies for wireless broadband networks;
products for transmission of telephony and high-speed data over
hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems; integrated digital radios;
and integrated public safety systems. These risks include:
(i) difficulties and delays in the development, production,
testing and marketing of products; (ii) customer acceptance
of products; (iii) the development of, approval and
compliance with industry standards; (iv) the significant
amount of resources we must devote to the development of new
technology; and (v) the ability to differentiate our
products and compete with other companies in the same markets.

Our success, in part, will be affected by the ability of our
wireless businesses to successfully compete in the ever-evolving
markets in which we participate. We face intense competition in
these markets from both established companies and new entrants.
Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive
to develop and bring to market.

Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form
successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not
develop as expected, our business may be adversely impacted.

We currently partner with industry leaders to meet customer
product and service requirements and to develop innovative
advances in design and technology. Some of our partnerships
allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share
the cost of developing next-generation technologies. Other
partnerships allow us to offer more services and features to our
customers. If such arrangements do not develop as expected, our
business could be adversely impacted.

We rely on third-party distributors, representatives and
retailers to sell certain of our products.

In addition to our own distribution force, we offer our products
through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives
and retailers. Certain of our distributors or representatives
may market products that compete with the Company’s
products. The loss, termination or failure of one or more of our
distributors or representatives to effectively promote our
products, or changes in the financial or business condition of
these distributors, representatives or retailers, could affect
the Company’s ability to bring its products to market.

Our business will be harmed if we are found to have infringed
intellectual property rights of third parties, or if our
intellectual property protection is inadequate to protect our
proprietary rights.

Because our products are comprised of complex technology, we are
involved in litigation regarding patent and other intellectual
property rights. Third parties have asserted, and in the future
may assert, claims against us alleging that we have infringed
their intellectual property rights. If we do not succeed in any
such litigation, we could be required to expend significant
resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual
property or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that
is the subject of such litigation. However, we cannot be certain
that any such licenses, if available at all, will be available
to us on commercially reasonable terms. Also, defending these
claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our
management and employees.

Our patent and other intellectual property rights are important
competitive tools and may generate income under license
agreements. We regard our intellectual property rights as
proprietary and attempt to protect them with patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality
agreements and other methods. We also generally restrict access
to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite
these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to
obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar
technology independently. In addition, effective patent,
copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be
unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third
parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our
intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our
business.

As we expand our business, including through acquisitions, and
compete with new competitors in new markets, the breadth and
strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new
areas may not be as developed as in



our longer-standing businesses. This may expose us to a
heightened risk of litigation and other challenges from
competitors in these new markets.

Our future operating results may be negatively impacted if we
are not successful in licensing our intellectual property.

As part of business strategy, primarily in our Mobile Devices
business, we strategically license our intellectual property.
Our existing intellectual property may not continue to generate
sales and operating earnings at current levels and we may not be
successful at licensing new intellectual property.

Many of our components and products are manufactured by third
    parties and if third-party manufacturers lack sufficient quality
    control or if there are significant changes in the financial or
    business condition of such

third-party

manufacturers, it may have a material adverse effect on our
    business.

We rely on third-party suppliers for many of the components used
in our products and we rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products. If we
are not able to engage such manufacturers with the capabilities
or capacities required by our business, or such third parties
lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant
changes in the financial or business condition of such third
parties, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We also have third-party arrangements for the design or
manufacture of certain products, parts and components. If we are
not able to engage such parties with the capabilities or
capacities required by our business, or these third parties fail
to deliver quality products, parts and components on time and at
reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our
orders and our sales and profits could decline.

There is no guarantee that design wins will become actual
    orders and sales.

A “design win” occurs when a customer or prospective
customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be
integrated with the customer’s product. There can be delays
of several months or more between the design win and when a
customer initiates actual orders. The design win may never
become an actual order or sale. Further, if the customer’s
plans change, we may commit significant resources to design wins
that do not result in actual orders.

We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions.
    Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such
    actions on our business may be limited by a variety of factors.
    The cost reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional
    production risk and have an adverse effect on our sales and
    profitability.

We have been reducing costs and simplifying our product
portfolios in all of our businesses. We have discontinued
product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing
operations, increased manufacturing with third parties and
reduced our employee population.

The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and
profitability may be influenced by factors including, but not
limited to: (1) our ability to successfully complete these
ongoing efforts; (2) our ability to generate the level of
cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to
effectively compete; (3) delays in implementation of
anticipated workforce reductions in highly-regulated locations
outside of the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia;
(4) decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet
operational targets due to the loss of employees; (5) our
ability to retain or recruit key employees; (6) our
manufacturing capacity, including capacity from third parties;
and (7) the performance of other parties under contract
manufacturing arrangements on which we rely for the manufacture
of certain products, parts and components.

An important cost-reduction action has been to reduce the number
of our facilities, including manufacturing facilities. All of
our businesses have exited certain facilities or consolidated
facilities so that our products are manufactured in fewer
facilities. While we have business continuity and risk
management plans in place in case capacity is significantly
reduced or eliminated at a given facility, the reduced number of
alternative facilities could cause the period of any
manufacturing disruptions to be longer. As a result, we could
have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and
profits could decline.



We may not continue to have access to the capital markets to
    obtain long-term and short-term financing on acceptable terms
    and conditions, particularly if our credit ratings are
    downgraded.

From time to time we access the long-term and short-term capital
markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that we can
continue to access the capital markets in 2007 on acceptable
terms and conditions, our access and the availability of
acceptable terms and conditions are impacted by many factors,
including: (i) our credit ratings; (ii) the liquidity
of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the current state
of the economy, including the telecommunications industry. There
can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to the
capital markets on terms acceptable to the Company.

The Company’s debt ratings are considered “investment
grade”. If our credit ratings were to decline three levels
from the current rating, we would no longer be considered
investment grade and our financial flexibility would be reduced
and our cost of borrowing would increase. Some of the factors
that impact our credit ratings, including the overall economic
health of the telecommunications industry, are outside of our
control. There can be no assurances that our current credit
ratings will continue.

Our commercial paper is rated “A-1/ P-2/ F-1.”
Although we continue to issue commercial paper, there can be no
assurances that we will continue to have access to the
commercial paper markets on terms acceptable to the Company.

We may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility
    if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing in our
    facility.

We view our existing five-year revolving domestic credit
facility as a source of available liquidity. This facility
contains various conditions, covenants and representations with
which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We have
never borrowed under this facility or previous domestic
revolving credit facilities. However, if we wish to borrow under
this facility in the future, there can be no assurance that we
will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and
representations.

We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other
companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce
significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to
integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from
the acquisitions.

In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth
opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the difficulty
in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an
efficient and effective manner; (2) the challenges in
achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits
from acquisitions; (3) the risk that our markets do not
evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not
prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;
(4) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired
businesses; (5) the risk of diverting the attention of
senior management from our operations; (6) the risks of
entering new markets in which we have limited experience;
(7) risks associated with integrating financial reporting
and internal control systems; (8) difficulties in expanding
information technology systems and other business processes to
accommodate the acquired businesses; and (9) future
impairments of goodwill of an acquired business.

In 2006 and early 2007, we made several strategic acquisitions.
In January 2007, we acquired Symbol Technologies, Inc.
(“Symbol”). Symbol, which is now a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Motorola, is being integrated with Motorola and
will form the core of Motorola’s enterprise mobility
business within our Networks and Enterprise segment. As a result
of the acquisition, approximately 5,200 employees joined
Motorola. In light of the size of this transaction, some of the
risks described above may be more significant.

Acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate
may carry higher relative valuations (based on their earnings)
than we do. This is particularly evident in software and
services businesses. Acquiring a business that has a higher
valuation than Motorola may be dilutive to our earnings,
especially when the acquired business has little or no revenue.
In addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly
dilutive to near-term earnings and have, in the past, foregone
certain of these acquisitions.

Key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial
value in connection with a transaction in the form of

change-in

-control
agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of
restrictions on other equity-based compensation rights. To
retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we
may offer additional retention incentives, but it may still be
difficult to retain certain key employees.



The value of our investments in the securities of various
    companies fluctuates and it may be difficult for us to realize
    the value of these investments.

We hold a portfolio of investments in various companies. Since
the majority of these securities represent investments in
technology companies, the fair market values of these securities
are subject to significant price volatility. In addition, the
realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
other conditions.

We also have invested in numerous privately-held companies, many
of which can still be considered in startup or developmental
stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for
the technologies or products they have under development are
typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
could lose all or substantially all of our investments in these
companies, and in some cases have.

We purchase a large amount of credit insurance to mitigate
    some of our credit risks.

Our ability to sell certain of our receivables could be
negatively impacted if we are not able to continue to purchase
credit insurance in certain countries and in sufficient
quantities. In addition, our success in certain countries may be
dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient credit insurance.

It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of
    highly-skilled employees that are necessary to remain
    competitive.

Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology
industries is intense. We believe that our future success
depends in large part on our continued ability to hire,
assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified
engineers and other highly-skilled personnel needed to compete
and develop successful new products. We may not be as successful
as our competitors at recruiting, assimilating, retaining and
utilizing these highly-skilled personnel.

The unfavorable outcome of litigation pending or future
    litigation could materially impact the Company.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation. See
“Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.”
There can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any
litigation.

We are subject to a wide range of environmental, health and
    safety laws.

Our operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are
subject to a wide range of global environmental, health and
safety laws. Compliance with existing or future environmental,
health and safety laws could subject us to future costs,
liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our
ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities and generally
impact our financial performance.

Some of these laws relate to the use, disposal, clean up of, and
exposure to hazardous substances. In the United States, laws
often require parties to fund remedial studies or action
regardless of fault. Motorola continues to incur disposal cost
and has ongoing remediation obligations. Changes to
U.S. environmental laws or our discovery of additional
obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on
Motorola.

Over the last several years, environmental laws focused on the
energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories;
electronic products and packaging, recycling; and reducing or
eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products
have expanded dramatically. These laws impact our products and
make it more expensive to manufacture and sell product. It may
also be difficult to comply with the laws in a timely way and we
may not have compliant products available in the quantities
requested by our customers, thereby impacting our sales and
profitability. For example, electronic products sold into Europe
were required to meet stringent chemical restrictions by
July 1, 2006 under the EU RoHS Directive. China is adopting
similar requirements, the first of which require labeling and
chemical content disclosure for all electronic products sold
into or within China after February 28, 2007. We expect
these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate increased
consumer demand for the voluntary reduction or elimination of
certain hazardous constituents from our wireless handsets.



We may provide financing and financial guarantees to our
    customers, some of which may be for significant amounts.

The competitive environment in which we operate may require us
to provide long-term customer financing to a customer in order
to win a contract. Customer financing arrangements may include
all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and
services. In some circumstances, these loans can be very large.
We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks
and other sources and may also provide financial guarantees on
behalf of our customers. Our success, particularly in our
infrastructure businesses, may be dependent, in part, upon our
ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and
on our customers’ creditworthiness.

We also provide revolving, short-term financing to certain
customers and distributors that purchase our equipment. Our
success may be dependent, in part, on our ability to provide
this financing. Our financial results could be negatively
impacted if our customers or distributors fail to repay this
revolving, short-term debt and/or our sales to such customers or
distributors could be reduced in the event of real or perceived
issues about the credit quality of the customer or distributor.

When we lend our customers money in connection with the sale
    of our equipment, we are at risk of not being repaid.

While we have generally been able to place a portion of our
customer financings with third-party lenders, a portion of these
financings are supported directly by us. There can be higher
risks of default associated with some of these financings,
particularly when provided to

start-up

operations
such as local network providers, customers in developing
countries, or customers in specific financing-intensive areas of
the industry (such as 3G wireless operators). Should customers
fail to meet their obligations on new or existing loans, losses
could be incurred and such losses could negatively impact our
financial results.

Our large system contracts for infrastructure equipment and
    the resulting reliance on large customers may negatively impact
    our business.

We are exposed to risks due to large system contracts for
infrastructure equipment and the resulting reliance on large
customers. These include: (1) the technological risks of
such contracts, especially when the contracts involve new
technology, and (2) financial risks under these contracts,
including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated
with large contracts and the related impact on operating
results. We are also facing increasing competition from
traditional system integrators and the defense industry as
system contracts become larger and more complicated. Political
developments can impact the nature and timing of these large
contracts.

It is important that we are able to obtain many different
    types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance
    we are forced to retain the risk.

The Company has many types of insurance coverage and also
self-insures for some risks and obligations. The insurance
market was disrupted after the events of September 11, 2001
and the 2005 hurricanes. While the cost and availability of most
insurance has stabilized, there are still certain types and
levels of insurance that remain unavailable. Natural disasters
and certain risks arising from securities claims and public
liability are potential self-insured events that could
negatively impact our financial performance.

Government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the
    growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce
    barriers to entry for new competitors.

Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The
allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other
countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and
personal communications industry may be affected if adequate
frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new
technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies
currently allocated for such use. Industry growth has been and
may continue to be affected by the cost of new licenses required
to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.

The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing
new wireless communications technologies to be developed and
offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network
systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as
WiMAX. Other countries have also deregulated portions of the
available spectrum to allow these and other technologies, which
can be offered without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may
introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and
our customers.



Changes in government policies and laws or economic
    conditions may adversely affect our financial results.

Our results may be affected by changes in trade, monetary and
fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of
U.S. and

non-U.S.

governments,
agencies and similar organizations. Our results may also be
affected by social and economic conditions, which impact our
operations, including in emerging markets in Asia, India, Latin
America and Eastern Europe, and in markets subject to ongoing
political hostilities and war, including the Middle East.

In addition, there are currently few laws or regulations that
apply directly to access to, or commerce on, the Internet. We
could be adversely affected by any such regulation in any
country where we operate. The adoption of such measures could
decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase
the cost of selling such products.

Consolidations in both the cable and telecommunication
    industries may adversely impact our business.

The cable and telecommunication industries have experienced
consolidation, and this trend is expected to continue according
to industry estimates. Industry consolidation could result in
delays of purchases or in the selection of new suppliers by the
merged companies to equipment suppliers such as Motorola and our
competitors.

Due to continuing consolidation within the cable industry
worldwide, a small number of operators own a majority of cable
television systems and account for a significant portion of the
capital spending made by cable television system operators. Net
sales to the Connected Home Solutions segment’s largest
customer, Comcast represented approximately 29% of the Connected
Home Solutions segment’s total net sales in 2006.

Regulatory changes impacting our cable products may adversely
impact our business.

Currently, reception of digital television programming from the
cable broadband network requires a set-top box with certain
technology. This security technology has limited the
availability of set-top boxes to those manufactured by a few
cable network manufacturers, including Motorola. The FCC has
enacted regulations requiring separation of security
functionality from set-top boxes to increase competition and
encourage the sale of set-top boxes in the retail market by
July 1, 2007. Traditionally, cable service providers sold
or leased the set-top box to their customer. If the retail
market develops for set-top boxes and televisions capable of
accepting the security modules, sales of our set-top boxes may
be negatively impacted. In addition, we risk lost sales if
competitors bring set-top boxes with separable security to
market before we do.

We rely on complex information technology systems and
    networks to operate our business. Any significant system or
    network disruption could have a material adverse impact on our
    operations, sales and operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex
information technology systems and networks. All information
technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or
interruption from a variety of sources, including but not
limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts,
natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new
or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not
installed properly. We have implemented various measures to
manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but
a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our
operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur
additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these
disruptions or security breaches.

Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.

Our share price has been volatile due, in part, to generally
volatile securities markets, and the volatility in the
telecommunications and technology companies’ securities
markets in particular. Factors other than our financial results
that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to,
market expectations of our performance, capital spending plans
of our customers, and the level of perceived growth in the
industries in which we participate.

The level of returns on pension and retirement plan assets
    could affect our earnings in future periods.

The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by
the performance of the financial markets, particularly the
equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are
determined under government regulations and are measured each
year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific
date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term
returns that are expected under the governmental funding
calculations we could be



required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can
be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our
estimate of future contribution requirements can change
dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly,
changes in interest rates can impact our contribution
requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood
of required contributions in the future increases.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance
    and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.

Compliance with changing laws, regulations and standards
relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,
including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations
and changes to the New York Stock Exchange rules, has required
us to expend significant resources and incur additional expenses
and will continue to do so. We are committed to maintaining the
highest standards of corporate governance and public disclosure.
As a result, we will continue to invest necessary resources to
comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this
investment may continue to result in increased general and
administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and
attention from revenue-generating activities.

The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of
    our income tax returns by the IRS.

We are subject to continued examination of our income tax
returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no
assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations
will not have an adverse effect on future operating results.

Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2: Properties

Motorola’s principal executive offices are located at 1303
East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196. Motorola also
operates manufacturing facilities and sales offices in other
U.S. locations and in many other countries. (See
“Item 1: Business” for information regarding the
location of the principal manufacturing facilities for each of
Motorola’s business segments.) Motorola owns 41 facilities
(manufacturing, sales, service and office), 21 of which are
located in North America and 20 of which are located in other
countries. Motorola leases 295 facilities, 90 of which are
located in North America and 205 of which are located in other
countries.

As compared to 2005, the number of facilities owned or leased,
excluding new acquisitions, was reduced primarily because of the
optimization of space and workplace mobility programs being
utilized instead of adding sites and space. New business
acquisitions closed to date have added 21 sites to the Motorola
real estate portfolio worldwide. In addition, as part of
Motorola’s overall strategy to reduce operating costs and
improve the financial performance of the corporation, a number
of businesses and facilities have either been sold or are
currently for sale. During 2006, facilities in Rohnert Park,
California and Ichon, Korea and land parcels in Elgin, Illinois
and Tempe, Arizona were sold. A facility in Deer Park, Illinois
was sold as part of the sale of the automotive electronics
business. Sites at Glen Rock, New Jersey and Guangzhou, China
and land parcels in Anderson, South Carolina and Tempe, Arizona
are currently up for sale.

Motorola generally considers the productive capacity of the
plants operated by each of its business segments to be adequate
and sufficient for the requirements of each business group. The
extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies
from plant to plant and from time to time during the year.

A substantial portion of Motorola’s products are
manufactured in Asia, primarily China, either in our own
facilities or in the facilities of others who manufacture and
assemble products for Motorola. If manufacturing in the region
was disrupted, Motorola’s overall productive capacity could
be significantly reduced.



Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Personal Injury Cases

Cases relating to Wireless Telephone Usage

On May 26, 2000, a purported nationwide class action suit

Naquin, et al., v. Nokia Mobile Phones, et al.

was
filed against Motorola and several other cellular phone
manufacturers and carriers in the Civil District Court for the
Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana. The case alleges the
failure to incorporate a remote headset into cellular phones
rendered the phones defective by exposing users to biological
injury and health risks and plaintiffs seek compensatory damages
and injunctive relief. Similar state class action suits were
filed on April 19, 2001, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore
City, Maryland,

Pinney and Colonell v. Nokia, Inc. et
al.,

and in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas,
Philadelphia County,

Farina v. Nokia, Inc., et al.;

and on April 20, 2001, in the Supreme Court of the Sate of
New York, County of Bronx,

Gilliam et al., v. Nokia,
Inc., et al.

During 2001, after removal to federal court,
the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL
Panel”) transferred the above four cases to the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland (the
“MDL Court”) for coordinated or consolidated pretrial
proceedings in the matter called

In re Wireless Telephone
Radio Frequency Emissions Products Liability Litigation

(the
“MDL Proceeding”).

The

Pinney

and

Gilliam

plaintiffs dismissed these
cases without prejudice in April and March 2006, respectively.
On November 6, 2006, plaintiffs dismissed the

Naquin

case without prejudice.

In 2005, as a result of a decision of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the

Farina

case was
remanded to Pennsylvania state courts from which it was removed.
In late 2005 and early 2006, Plaintiffs in

Farina

amended
their complaints to add allegations that cellular telephones
sold without headsets are defective because they present a
safety risk when used while driving and to seek punitive
damages.

Farina

also seeks declaratory relief and treble
and statutory damages. After the

Farina

complaint was
amended, on February 17, 2006, a newly-added defendant to
the

Farina

case removed the case to federal court. As of
June 15, 2006, the MDL Panel formally transferred the
newly-removed

Farina

case to the MDL Court. On
November 10, 2006, defendants moved to dismiss

Farina

and filed a motion for referral to the FCC. On
November 10, 2006, plaintiff moved to remand

Farina

to state court. Plaintiff also filed an alternative motion
for suggestion of remand to the transferor court in
Philadelphia. All

Farina

motions are pending before the
MDL Court.

During 2001 and 2002, several additional cases were filed
alleging that use of a cellular phone caused a malignant brain
tumor

: Murray v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

, filed
November 15, 2001, in the Superior Court of the District of
Columbia;

Agro et. al., v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al

., filed February 26, 2002, in the Superior
Court of the District of Columbia;

Cochran et. al., v.
Audiovox Corporation, et al

., filed February 26,
2002, in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and
S

chofield et. al., v. Matsushita Electric Corporation of
America, et al.

, filed February 26, 2002, in the
Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Each complaint seeks
compensatory damages in excess of $25 million,
consequential damages in excess of $25 million and punitive
and/or exemplary damages in excess of $100 million. These
cases were removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL
Court. On July 19, 2004, the MDL Court found that there was
no federal court jurisdiction over

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

and remanded those cases to the Superior
Court for the District of Columbia. On November 30, 2004,
defendants moved to dismiss the

Murray, Agro, Cochran

and

Schofield

complaints. That motion remains pending before
the Superior Court for the District of Columbia.

Brower v. Motorola, Inc., et al.,

filed
April 19, 2001, in the Superior Court of the State of
California, County of San Diego, also seeks relief on
behalf of an individual who had brain cancer. A first amended
complaint was filed in

Brower

to add class allegations
that defendants engaged in deceptive and misleading actions by
falsely stating that cellular phones are safe and by failing to
disclose studies that allegedly show cellular phones can cause
harm.

Brower

seeks injunctive relief, restitution,
compensatory and punitive damages and disgorgement of profits.
On September 9, 2002,

Dahlgren v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al.,

was filed in the D.C. Superior Court containing
class claims similar to

Brower.

Dahlgren

seeks
injunctive and equitable relief, actual damages, treble or
statutory damages, punitive damages and a constructive trust.
These two cases were also removed to federal court and
transferred to the MDL Court. On June 10, 2005, the

Dahlgren

case was remanded to the Superior Court for the
District of Columbia. On December 9, 2005, plaintiff filed
an amended complaint in

Dahlgren.

Defendants moved to
dismiss

Dahlgren

on February 3, 2006. That motion is
still pending. On February 15, 2006, the MDL Court remanded

Brower

to California state court. The California state
court set a deadline of January 19, 2007, for the filing of
an amended complaint. To date, no amended complaint has been
filed.



Iridium-Related Cases

Class Action Securities Lawsuits

Motorola has been named as one of several defendants in putative
class action securities lawsuits arising out of alleged
misrepresentations or omissions regarding the Iridium satellite
communications business, which on March 15, 2001, were
consolidated in the federal district court in the District of
Columbia under

Freeland v. Iridium World Communications,
Inc., et al.,

originally filed on April 22, 1999.
Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was granted on
January 9, 2006 and the trial is scheduled to begin on
May 22, 2008.

Bankruptcy Court Lawsuit

Motorola was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
Creditors of Iridium in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York on July 19, 2001.

In re Iridium
Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserts claims
for breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty and fraudulent
transfer and preferences, and seeks in excess of $4 billion
in damages. Trial began on the solvency portion of these claims
on October 23, 2006.

On March 30, 2001, the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York presiding over the Iridium
bankruptcy proceeding approved a settlement between the
unsecured creditors of the Iridium Debtors and the Iridium
Debtors’ pre-petition secured lenders. The settlement
agreement creates and provides for the funding of a litigation
vehicle for the purpose of pursuing litigation against Motorola.
Motorola appealed the approval of the settlement to the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On
April 7, 2005, the District Court entered an order denying
Motorola’s appeal and affirming the settlement. On
May 4, 2005, Motorola filed a notice of appeal to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The
appeal is fully briefed and argued and remains pending.

Iridium India Lawsuits

Motorola and certain of its current and former officers and
directors were named as defendants in a private criminal
complaint filed by Iridium India Telecom Ltd. (“Iridium
India”) in October 2001 in the Court of the Extra Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Khadki, Pune, India. The

Iridium
India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola, Inc. et al.

complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to, and did,
commit the criminal offense of “cheating” by
fraudulently inducing Iridium India to purchase gateway
equipment from Motorola, to acquire Iridium stock, and to invest
in developing a market for Iridium services in India. Under the
Indian penal code, “cheating” is punishable by
imprisonment for up to 7 years and a fine of any amount.
The court may also require defendants to compensate the victim
for its losses, which the complaint estimates at about
$100 million. In August 2003, the Bombay High Court granted
Motorola’s petition to dismiss the criminal action against
Motorola and the individual defendants. Iridium India has
petitioned the Indian Supreme Court to exercise its discretion
to review that dismissal, and that petition is pending.

In September 2002, Iridium India also filed a civil suit in the
Bombay High Court against Motorola and Iridium. The suit alleges
fraud, intentional misrepresentation and negligent
misrepresentation by Motorola and Iridium in inducing Iridium
India to purchase gateway equipment from Motorola, to acquire
Iridium stock, and to invest in developing a market for Iridium
services in India. Iridium India claims in excess of
$200 million in damages and interest. Following extensive
proceedings in the trial court and on appeal related to Iridium
India’s motion for interim relief, Motorola has deposited
approximately $44 million in a specially designated account
in India, and the Indian Supreme Court has accepted for a full
hearing at a later date Motorola’s appeal regarding interim
relief.

Shareholder Derivative Case—Iridium and Telsim

M

&

C Partners III v. Galvin, et al.,

filed January 10, 2002, in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois, is a shareholder derivative action against
fifteen current and former members of the Motorola Board of
Directors and Motorola as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit
alleges that the Motorola directors breached their fiduciary
duty to the Company and/or committed gross mismanagement of
Motorola’s business and assets by allowing Motorola to
engage in improper practices with respect to Iridium and Telsim
(as defined below).

In April 2006, the Court held that the plaintiff could not
pursue its Iridium-related claims, but denied without prejudice
plaintiff’s motion to file a Third Amended Complaint with
respect to new allegations pertaining to Telsim. Following the
Court’s ruling for defendants on the Iridium-related claims
and plaintiff’s July 20, 2006 demand with respect to
Telsim-related claims, the Motorola Board of Directors appointed
an investigatory committee to investigate those Telsim-related
claims.



An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the Iridium-related
cases still pending could have a material adverse effect on
Motorola’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Telsim-Related Cases

In April 2001, Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.
(“Telsim”), a wireless telephone operator in Turkey,
defaulted on the payment of approximately $2 billion of
loans owed to Motorola and its subsidiaries
(the “Telsim Loans”). Motorola fully reserved the
carrying value of the Telsim Loans in the second quarter of
2002. The Uzan family controlled Telsim until 2004 when an
agency of the Turkish government took over control of Telsim.
Telsim was sold by the Turkish government to Vodafone in 2006.
Motorola received payment from the sale, pursuant to the
settlement described below. Motorola is involved in several
matters related to Telsim.

October 2005 Settlement

In 2005, Motorola signed an agreement resolving its disputes
regarding the Telsim Loans with Telsim and the Government of
Turkey (the “Telsim Dispute Agreement”). Under the
Telsim Dispute Agreement, Motorola was paid $410 million on
May 24, 2006 (in addition to the $500 million Motorola
received pursuant to the Telsim Dispute Agreement in 2005) upon
Vodafone’s completion of its acquisition of Telsim as final
payment. Motorola also agreed that it will not pursue collection
efforts against the three corporate defendants under TMSF
control (Unikom Iletisim Hizmetleri Pazarlama A.S., Standart
Pazarlama A.S., and Standart Telekomunikasyon Bilgisayar
Hizmetleri A.S.) (the “Corporate Defendants”), that
are subject to its final judgment in the U.S. courts
related to the matter. The Telsim Dispute Agreement permits
Motorola to continue its efforts (except in Turkey and three
other countries, which restriction is subject to certain
conditions) to enforce the U.S. Judgment described below
against the Uzan family. In addition, pursuant to the Telsim
Dispute Agreement, Telsim and its related companies have
dismissed all litigation, including arbitrations, pending
against Motorola.

U.S. Judgment

The Company continues its efforts to collect on its judgment of
$2.13 billion (the “U.S. Judgment”) for
compensatory damages rendered by the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York
(the “District Court”) against the Uzans on
July 31, 2003 and affirmed by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (the “Second Circuit”)
in 2004 and in connection with foreign proceedings against the
Uzan family. However, the Company believes that the ongoing
litigation, collection and/or settlement processes against the
Uzan family will be very lengthy in light of the Uzans’
continued resistance to satisfy the judgment against them and
their decision to violate various courts’ orders, including
orders holding them in contempt of court. Following a remand
from the Second Circuit of the U.S. Judgment by the
District Court, on February 8, 2006, the District Court
awarded a judgment in favor of Motorola for $1 billion in
punitive damages against the Uzan family and their
co-conspirator, Antonio Luna Bettancourt. The defendants have
appealed this judgment to the Second Circuit.

Class Action Securities Lawsuits

A purported class action lawsuit,

Barry Family LP v.
Carl F. Koenemann

, was filed against the former chief
financial officer of Motorola on December 24, 2002 in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
SEC Rule

10b-5.

In
2003, it was consolidated with a number of related cases as

In re Motorola Securities Litigation

in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the
“Illinois District Court”). The plaintiffs allege that
the price of Motorola’s stock was artificially inflated by
a failure to disclose vendor financing to Telsim Mobil
Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. (“Telsim”), in
connection with the sale of telecommunications equipment by
Motorola as well as other related aspects of Motorola’s
dealings with Telsim. On August 25, 2004, the Illinois
District Court issued its decision on Motorola’s motion to
dismiss, granting the motion in part and denying it in part. The
court dismissed without prejudice the fraud claims against the
individual defendants and denied the motion to dismiss as to
Motorola. The plaintiffs chose not to file an amended complaint;
therefore, the fraud claims against the individual defendants
are dismissed. The court, however, declined to dismiss the
plaintiffs’ claims that the individual defendants were
“controlling persons of Motorola.” During 2005, the
court certified the case as a class action. The case is
scheduled for trial beginning April 16, 2007.

A purported class action,

Howell v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al.

, was filed against Motorola and various of its
directors, officers and employees in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 21,
2003, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act



(“ERISA”). The complaint alleged that the defendants
had improperly permitted participants in the Motorola 401(k)
Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase or hold shares of common
stock of Motorola because the price of Motorola’s stock was
artificially inflated by a failure to disclose vendor financing
to Telsim in connection with the sale of telecommunications
equipment by Motorola. The plaintiff sought to represent a class
of participants in the Plan for whose individual accounts the
Plan purchased or held shares of common stock of Motorola from
“May 16, 2000 to the present”, and sought an
unspecified amount of damages. On September 30, 2005, the
district court dismissed the second amended complaint filed on
October 15, 2004 (the “Howell Complaint”).
Plaintiff filed an appeal to the dismissal on October 27,
2005. In addition, on October 19, 2005, plaintiff’s
counsel filed a motion seeking to add a new lead plaintiff and
assert the same claims set forth in the Howell Complaint (the
“October 19

th

Motion”).
On August 11, 2006, the district court denied the
October 19

th

Motion,
finding the second purported plaintiff lacked standing to sue.
Plaintiff filed an appeal. On November 20, 2006, the
appeals court dismissed the second appeal. Three new purported
lead plaintiffs have since intervened in the case, and have
filed a motion for class certification seeking to represent Plan
participants for whose individual accounts the Plan purchased
and/or held shares of Motorola common stock from May 16, 2000
through December 31, 2002.

Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation

Motorola was involved in an investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding Telsim matters.
On February 5, 2007, the investigation was terminated by
the SEC and the Company was notified that no enforcement action
was recommended by the SEC.

Charter Communications Class Action Securities
    Litigation

On August 5, 2002, Stoneridge Investment Partners LLC filed
a purported class action in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Missouri (“District Court”)
against Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) and
certain of its officers, alleging violations of
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule

10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to Charter securities. This
complaint did not name Motorola as a defendant, but asserted
that Charter and the other named defendants had violated the
securities laws in connection with,

inter alia,

a
transaction with Motorola. On August 5, 2003, the plaintiff
amended its complaint to add Motorola, Inc. as a defendant. As
to Motorola, the amended complaint alleges a claim under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule

10b-5(a)

-(c)
promulgated thereunder relating to Charter securities and seeks
an award of compensatory damages. The District Court issued a
final judgment dismissing Motorola from the case which plaintiff
appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit (“Court of Appeals”). On April 11, 2006,
the Court of Appeals affirmed the final judgment of the District
Court dismissing Motorola from the case. On July 7, 2006
plaintiff filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of the
Court of Appeals decision by the United States Supreme Court. On
October 20, 2006, Motorola submitted its response opposing
the petition.

In re Adelphia Communications Corp. Securities and
    Derivative Litigation

On December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a defendant in
two cases relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation

(the “Adelphia
MDL”). The Adelphia MDL consists of at least fourteen
individual cases and one purported class action that were filed
in or have been transferred to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. First, Motorola was named
as a defendant in the Second Amended Complaint in the individual
case of

W.R. Huff Asset Management Co. L.L.C. v.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, et al.

(the “Huff
Complaint”) This case was originally filed by W.R. Huff
Asset Management Co. L.L.C. on June 7, 2002, in the United
States District Court for the Western District of New York and
was subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New
York as related to the Adelphia MDL. Several other individual
and corporate defendants are also named in the amended complaint
along with Motorola.

As to Motorola, the complaint alleges a claim arising under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule

10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to Adelphia securities, and
seeks recovery of the consideration paid by plaintiff for
Adelphia debt securities, compensatory damages, costs and
expenses of litigation and other relief. Motorola filed a motion
to dismiss this complaint on March 8, 2004, which is
awaiting decision.

Also on December 22, 2003, Motorola was named as a
defendant in

Stocke v. John J. Rigas, et al.

This case was originally filed in Pennsylvania and was
subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New York as
related to the Adelphia MDL. Several other individual and
corporate defendants are also named in the amended complaint
along with Motorola. As to Motorola, the complaint generally
makes the same allegations as the Huff Complaint and a state law
claim of aiding and abetting fraud relating to Adelphia
securities. The complaint seeks



return of the consideration paid by plaintiff for Adelphia
securities, punitive damages and other relief. Motorola filed a
motion to dismiss this complaint on April 12, 2004 which is
awaiting decision.

On July 23, 2004, Motorola was named as a defendant in

Argent Classic Convertible Arbitrage Fund L.P.,
et al. v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., et al.

(the “Argent Complaint”). The Argent Complaint was
filed against Scientific Atlanta and Motorola in the Southern
District of New York. The Argent Complaint generally makes the
same allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases
relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have been
transferred to the Southern District of New York. The complaint
seeks compensatory damages and other relief. On October 12,
2004, Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the Argent Complaint
which is awaiting decision.

On September 14, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
filed in state court in Los Angeles, California, naming Motorola
and Scientific-Atlanta and certain officers of
Scientific-Atlanta,

Los Angeles County Employees Retirement
Association et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al.

The complaint raises claims under California law for aiding and
abetting fraud and conspiracy to defraud and generally makes the
same allegations as the other previously-disclosed cases
relating to the

In re Adelphia Communications Corp.
Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have been
transferred to the Southern District of New York. There are no
new substantive allegations. The complaint seeks compensatory
damages, opportunity-cost damages, punitive and other exemplary
damages and other relief. In late 2004, the Multi-District
Litigation Panel transferred the case to federal court in New
York, which transfer is now final. On September 19, 2005,
Motorola filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in this action
which is awaiting decision.

On October 25, 2004, Motorola was named in a complaint
filed in state court in Fulton County, Georgia, naming Motorola
and Scientific-Atlanta and certain officers of
Scientific-Atlanta,

AIG DKR SoundShore Holdings, Ltd.,
et al. v. Scientific-Atlanta Inc., et al.

The
complaint raises claims under Georgia law of conspiracy to
defraud and generally makes the same allegations as the other
previously disclosed cases relating to the

In re Adelphia
Communications Corp. Securities and Derivative Litigation

that have already been filed and transferred to the Southern
District of New York. The complaint seeks damages and statutory
compensation, punitive damages and other relief. On
April 18, 2005, the Multi-District Litigation Panel issued
a final order transferring the case to New York and that
transfer is final. On September 19, 2005, Motorola filed a
motion to dismiss the complaint in this action which is awaiting
decision.

Adelphia Communications Corp.—Related Cases

Bankruptcy
Court Lawsuit

On June 23, 2006, Adelphia objected to Motorola’s
claim for payment of $67 million and asserted causes of
action against Motorola including preferences, avoidance of
liens, fraudulent transfers, equitable subordination and aiding
and abetting fraud as part of the ongoing

Adelphia

bankruptcy action in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York. Plaintiff is alleging damages in excess of
$1 billion against Motorola for the above stated causes of
action.

Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation

Motorola is involved in an ongoing investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding Adelphia matters,
which remains outstanding. However, the Company has reached a
settlement agreement with the staff of the Northeast Regional
office of the SEC that is subject to final approval of the
Commission.

Motorola is a defendant in various other suits, claims and
investigations that arise in the normal course of business. In
the opinion of management, and other than discussed above with
respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate disposition of the
Company’s pending legal proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PART II

Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial
position and results of operations for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2006. This commentary
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto which appear beginning under
“Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.”

Executive Overview

What businesses are we in?

Motorola reports financial results for the following three
operating business segments:

•

The

Mobile Devices

segment designs, manufactures, sells
    and services wireless handsets with integrated software and
    accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. The
    segment’s net sales in 2006 were $28.4 billion,
    representing 66% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

•

The

Networks and Enterprise

segment designs,
    manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) cellular
    infrastructure systems and wireless broadband systems to public
    carriers and other wireless service providers (referred to as
    the “public networks” market), and (ii) analog
    and digital two-way radio, voice and data communications
    products and systems, as well as wireless broadband systems, to
    a wide range of public safety, government, utility,
    transportation and other worldwide enterprise markets (referred
    to as the “private networks” market). In January 2007,
    the segment completed the acquisition of Symbol Technologies,
    Inc. (“Symbol”), a leader in designing, developing,
    manufacturing and servicing products and systems used in

end-to

-end enterprise
    mobility solutions. Symbol will become the cornerstone of the
    segment’s enterprise mobility strategy. The segment’s
    net sales in 2006 were $11.2 billion, representing 26% of
    the Company’s consolidated net sales.

•

The

Connected Home Solutions

segment designs,
    manufactures, sells and services: (i) cable television,
    Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and broadcast network
    set-top boxes (“digital entertainment devices”),
    (ii)

end-to

-end
    digital video system solutions, (iii) broadband access
    networks, and
    (iv)

IP-based

data
    and voice products (including modems). The segment’s net
    sales in 2006 were $3.3 billion, representing 8% of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales.

What were our 2006 financial highlights?

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses Decreased by
    $1.8 Billion:

In 2005, we recognized $1.8 billion of
    net gains relating to our equity investments in other companies,
    primarily from gains on our shares of Sprint Nextel Corporation
    (“Sprint Nextel”), and its predecessors. In 2006, net
    gains from the sale of equity investments were $41 million,
    a decrease of $1.8 billion.

•

171.7 Million Shares of Motorola Common Stock
    Repurchased for $3.8 Billion:

During 2006, the Company
    repurchased 171.7 million of its common shares for an
    aggregate cost of $3.8 billion. In 2005, when the Company
    initiated the first stock repurchase program in its history, it
    repurchased 41.7 million common shares at a cost of
    $874 million.

What were the financial highlights for our three operating
businesses in 2006?

•

In Our Mobile Devices Business:

Net sales increased by
    $6.9 billion, or 32%, to $28.4 billion and operating
    earnings increased by 23% to $2.7 billion. As the second
    largest worldwide supplier of wireless handsets, we shipped
    217.4 million handsets in 2006, up 49% from 2005, and
    gained more than four percentage points of global market
    share to an estimated 22%. The gain in market share reflected
    strong demand for our products, particularly our products for
    GSM and CDMA technologies. The segment had higher net sales in
    High Growth markets (defined as countries in the Middle East,
    Africa, Southeast Asia and India), North Asia, North America and
    Latin America, as a result of an improved product portfolio,
    strong market growth in emerging markets, and high replacement
    sales in more mature markets. Average selling price
    (“ASP”) decreased approximately 11% compared to 2005,
    driven primarily by an unfavorable geographic and product-tier
    mix.

•

In Our Networks and Enterprise Business:

Net sales
    increased by $43 million to $11.2 billion and
    operating earnings were down 22% to $1.5 billion. The
    business had higher net sales in the Europe, Middle East and
    Africa region (“EMEA”) and Latin America, largely
    offset by lower net sales in North America and Asia. The
    business’ slight increase in net sales reflected higher net
    sales in the private networks market, offset by lower net sales
    in the public networks market. The decrease in operating
    earnings was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in gross
    margin, due to an unfavorable product/regional mix and
    competitive pricing in the public networks market, and
    (ii) an increase in reorganization of business charges,
    primarily related to employee severance costs.

•

In Our Connected Home Solutions Business:

Net sales
    increased by $456 million, or 16%, to $3.3 billion and
    operating earnings increased by 46% to $224 million. The
    business had higher net sales in all regions. Net sales of
    digital entertainment devices increased by 24%, driven by a
    product-mix shift towards higher-end products, particularly HD/
    DVR set-top boxes. The segment continued to be the worldwide
    leader in market share for digital entertainment devices. Net
    sales of cable modems increased 18%, primarily due to increases
    in: (i) cable modem unit shipments, and (ii) ASPs,
    reflecting increased demand for voice-enabled modems. The
    business retained its leading worldwide market share in cable
    modems.

What were our major accomplishments and challenges in
2006?

In 2006, Motorola continued to focus on increasing profitable
sales and growing market share by building on our vision of
seamless mobility. We continued our expansion into developing
markets, enhanced Motorola’s product portfolio with
innovative and exciting new devices and solutions and built on
the leadership position of our three business segments through
strategic transactions. Although we did not meet our operating
earnings target in our Mobile Devices business during the fourth
quarter of 2006, we believe that Motorola remains well
positioned in our markets.

•

In Our Mobile Devices Business:

During the year,
    Motorola’s unit shipments grew faster than the total market
    and faster than our top competitors. As a result, Motorola
    believes it expanded its global market share in mobile handsets
    to approximately 22%, up more than 4 percentage points
    compared to 2005 market share.

The growth in unit sales was fueled by continued demand for the
    iconic MOTORAZR and new additions to our product portfolio.
    Motorola shipped 50 new devices in 2006, including the MOTO Q,
    for the customer who multi-tasks and wants flexibility in
    today’s fast-paced business environment, and the MOTOKRZR,
    for the customer eager to have the industry’s newest
    ultra-slim and ultra-stylish handset. Motorola also introduced
    the MOTORAZR (RED) and MOTOSLVR (RED), new wireless phones



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

In Our Networks and Enterprise Business:

One of
    Motorola’s most important initiatives in 2006 was to
    strengthen our position in enterprise mobility. Building on our
    Networks and Enterprise business’ record $11.2 billion
    of sales in 2006, Motorola significantly expanded its presence
    in the enterprise space. In January 2007, we completed the
    acquisition of Symbol Technologies, Inc. (“Symbol”),
    an industry leader in designing, developing, manufacturing and
    servicing products and systems used in end-to-end enterprise
    mobility solutions. Symbol has a world-class product portfolio
    and valuable intellectual property and will be the cornerstone
    of the Networks and Enterprise business’ enterprise
    strategy.

provider of OFDM-based non-line-of-sight (“NLOS”)
    wireless broadband infrastructure equipment. Also, Motorola sold
    its automotive electronics business to German automotive
    supplier Continental AG for approximately $900 million.

The Networks and Enterprise business faced challenges during
    2006, as sales of iDEN and GSM infrastructure declined compared
    to 2005. The business also continued to invest in
    next-generation technologies that did not, nor were expected to,
    contribute meaningful sales or earnings to the business in 2006.

•

In Our Connected Home Solutions Business:

The Connected
    Home Solutions business is the world’s leading provider of
    digital video set-top boxes and cable modems, with sales of
    $3.3 billion in 2006. Motorola shipped over 10 million
    digital set-tops this year and almost one-third of these
    shipments were high-definition TV (“HDTV”) capable.
    Motorola shipped over 10 million data modems, of which
    3.7 million were voice-over-IP (“VoIP”) capable.
    The fourth quarter saw Motorola ship its 50 millionth
    digital entertainment device, a significant milestone that
    underscored the Company’s heritage of delivering
    innovations for the digital cable connected home.

The segment expanded its next-generation digital video
    portfolio, completing several significant acquisitions,
    including: (i) Kreatel Communications AB, a leading
    developer of innovative IP-based digital set-top boxes and
    software, (ii) Broadbus Technologies, Inc., a provider of
    technology solutions for television on demand, and
    (iii) Vertasent LLC, a software developer for managing
    technology elements for switched digital video networks. In
    early 2007, the Connected Home Solutions business completed the
    acquisition of Netopia, Inc., a broadband equipment provider for
    DSL customers, which allows for phone, TV and fast Internet
    connections. The business also announced its intention to
    acquire Tut Systems, Inc., a leading developer of edge routing
    and video encoders. With these acquisitions, Motorola now has
    enhanced capabilities in its end-to-end, switched digital video
    solution and a leadership position in the IP-based set-top box
    market.

Looking Forward

Although our Networks and Enterprise and Connected Home
Solutions businesses ended 2006 with strong momentum, our Mobile
Devices business faced major challenges during the latter part
of 2006, causing its fourth-quarter profitability to fall
significantly short of our expectations. We intend to improve
the profitability of this business and we are taking the
necessary actions to make that happen. As we enter 2007, we
remain confident in the strength of each of our core markets.
With our continued dedication to quality and our unrelenting
focus on innovation, we are committed to executing on our
strategic plan and pursuing profitable sales growth across all
of our businesses. We believe that a balanced focus on
profitability and growth will drive shareholder value.

Our vision of seamless mobility continues to drive everything we
do. We are dedicated to building simple and seamless connections
to people, information and entertainment. We will do this by
continuing to revolutionize wireless networks and broadband
communications — bringing cutting-edge technologies
into everyday life and empowering the mobile consumer to go
anywhere and do anything without sacrificing complete
connectivity. We strive to design and deliver new “must
have” products, “must do” experiences and
powerful networks that enable mobility, along with a full
complement of support services. We will continue executing on
this vision by extending it around the world and unveiling new
technology platforms and products that break down the boundaries
of traditional communication and improve life.

As we continue to expand the geographies that our products and
services reach, it remains important that we embrace the unique
needs and customs of our local markets. Vast segments of the
world’s population, many of whom are yet to make a phone
call or connect to the Internet, represent a tremendous
opportunity for Motorola to extend our brand. As our world
becomes increasingly interlinked, Motorola is focused on
connecting “the next billion” mobile phone users.
Globalization has made, and will continue to make,
country-specific knowledge, talent and leadership indispensable.
We have worked to develop specific expertise that allows us to
understand the technology needs of each market, rather than a
“one-size-fits-all” solution. We are building a strong
and efficient footprint in the developing world, and we expect
that this will generate financial benefits for Motorola and make
a profound and lasting impact on those who were previously
unable to “connect.”

Going forward we are very focused on improving Motorola’s
operating margin percentage. Much of this focus will center on
our Mobile Devices business, which accounts for nearly
two-thirds of our sales and generated much lower than expected
operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2006. Over the last
three years, the focus on market



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

share growth in the Mobile Devices business has increased its
share of the global handset market from approximately 12% to
approximately 22%. Going forward, this business will rebalance
its market share and profitability objectives, with greater
emphasis on profitability. To do this, we will continue to
refresh and revitalize our product portfolio, with greater
emphasis on higher-tier multimedia experiences. At the same
time, we are increasing our focus on our cost structure, with
particular emphasis on reducing manufacturing and design costs.
We will seek to reduce costs and accelerate our time to market
by focusing on our silicon and software platform strategies. We
will also continue to invest in the Motorola brand, with
emphasis on effective marketing of 2007 product line
introductions. Although the Mobile Devices business will place a
greater emphasis on profitability, we recognize that
near-to-medium term pricing pressures will provide challenges to
improving margins and profitability.

The transformation of our Networks and Enterprise business began
in 2006, when we combined our cellular networks infrastructure
business with our government and enterprise mobility business,
and this transformation will continue in 2007. In early 2007, we
completed the acquisition of Symbol Technologies, Inc., which
now forms the cornerstone of our enterprise mobility business.
Our goal is to continue to grow our Networks and Enterprise
business consistently and profitably. We are investing to be the
leading infrastructure provider of WiMAX, a next-generation
wireless broadband technology, and we expect the WiMAX market to
begin to materialize in 2008 as several WiMAX networks come
on-line. Also, we will continue to develop next-generation
products and solutions for our government and public safety
customers, for whom homeland security and public safety needs
continue to be front and center. As the Internet goes mobile and
enterprise customers look to enhance productivity, we will
leverage our acquisition of Symbol with our existing enterprise
assets to capitalize on the enterprise mobility market.

Our Connected Home Solutions business will continue to focus on
expanding its leadership position in broadband connected home
products and services in North America while capitalizing on new
markets outside of North America. Our shipments outside North
America have grown in each of the last three years and these
markets continue to provide new growth opportunities. We believe
we are well positioned to capitalize on the convergence of
services and application across delivery platforms within the
home and across mobile applications.

We conduct our business in highly-competitive markets, facing
both new and established competitors. The markets for many of
our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies,
frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles
and evolving industry standards. Market disruptions caused by
new technologies, the entry of new (and often well-capitalized)
competitors into markets we serve, and frequent consolidations
among our customers and competitors, among other matters,
introduce volatility into our operating performance and cash
flow from operations. Meeting these disruptive challenges while
working towards full digital convergence requires continual
technological advancements and continued investment in
innovative solutions. We must have compelling products that meet
the expanding needs and evolving desires of our customers around
the world. We are focused on meeting these challenges and
improving our profitability.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Geographic market sales measured by the locale of the end
customer as a percent of total net sales for 2006, 2005 and 2004
are as follows:

Geographic Market Sales by Locale of End Customer

Results of Operations—2006 Compared to 2005

Net Sales

Net sales were $42.9 billion in 2006, up 22% compared to
$35.3 billion in 2005. The increase in net sales includes:
(i) a $6.9 billion increase in net sales by the Mobile
Devices segment, driven by a 49% increase in unit shipments,
reflecting strong demand for GSM and CDMA handsets, partially
offset by an 11% decline in average selling price
(“ASP”), (ii) a $456 million increase in net
sales by the Connected Home Solutions segment, primarily due to
increased demand for HD/ DVR set-top boxes, and (iii) a
$43 million increase in net sales by the Networks and
Enterprise segment, driven by higher net sales in the Europe,
Middle East and Africa region and Latin America, partially
offset by lower net sales in North America and Asia.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $12.7 billion, or 29.7% of net sales, in
2006, compared to $11.4 billion, or 32.4% of net sales, in
2005. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the
Mobile Devices segment, due to: (i) the 49% increase in
unit shipments, (ii) savings from supply chain
cost-reduction initiatives, and (iii) increased income from
technology and platform licensing, partially offset by an 11%
decline in ASP. The Connected Home Solutions segment also
achieved higher gross margin in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily
driven by a 16% increase in net sales. Gross margin decreased in
the Networks and Enterprise segment, due to an unfavorable
product/regional mix and competitive pricing in the public
networks market.

In 2006 compared to 2005, gross margin as a percentage of net
sales: (i) decreased in the Mobile Devices and Networks and
Enterprise segments, and (ii) increased in the Connected
Home Solutions segment. The Company’s overall gross margin
as a percentage of net sales can be impacted by the proportion
of overall net sales generated by its various businesses. The
decrease in overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales in
2006 compared to 2005 can be partially attributed to the fact
that an increased percentage of the Company’s net sales
were generated by the Mobile Devices segment, which generates
lower gross margins than the overall Company average.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expenses increased 24% to $4.5 billion, or 10.5% of net
sales, in 2006, compared to $3.6 billion, or 10.3% of net
sales, in 2005. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily
driven by: (i) increased marketing expenses, mainly in the
Mobile Devices segment, to support higher net sales and promote
brand awareness, (ii) recognition of share-based
compensation expense to SG&A-related employees in connection
with the adoption of SFAS 123R, and (iii) increased
selling and sales support expenses, driven by the increase in
sales commissions from the increase in net sales. SG&A
expenses as a percentage of net sales were up slightly, driven
by an increase in the Mobile Devices segment, offset by a
decreased in the Connected Home Solutions segment.

Research and Development Expenditures

Research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
increased 14% to $4.1 billion, or 9.6% of net sales, in
2006, compared to $3.6 billion, or 10.2% of net sales, in
2005. All three of the Company’s operating segments had
increased R&D expenditures in 2006 compared to 2005. This
increase was primarily due to: (i) developmental
engineering expenditures for new product development and
investment in next-generation technologies across all segments,
and (ii) recognition of share-based compensation expense to
R&D-related employees in connection with the adoption of
SFAS 123R. R&D expenditures as a percentage of net
sales decreased, driven by decreases in the Mobile Devices and
Connected Home Solutions segments.

Other Charges (Income)

The Company recorded charges of $25 million in Other
charges (income) in 2006, compared to income of
$404 million in 2005. The charges in 2006 include:
(i) $172 million of net charges for reorganization of
businesses, (ii) $100 million of charges relating to
the amortization of intangibles, (iii) an $88 million
charitable contribution to the Motorola Foundation of
appreciated equity holdings in a third party,
(iv) $50 million of legal reserves, and
(v) $33 million from acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (“IPR&D”),
partially offset by $418 million of income for collections
relating to the Telsim settlement. The net income of
$404 million in 2005 primarily consisted of
$515 million of income for collections relating to the
Telsim settlement, partially offset by:
(i) $67 million of charges relating to the
amortization of intangibles, (ii) $54 million of net
charges for reorganization of businesses, and
(iii) $2 million from acquisition-related IPR&D.
The net reorganization of businesses charges are discussed in
further detail in the “Reorganization of Businesses”
section.

Net Interest Income (Expense)

Net interest income was $326 million in 2006, compared to
net interest income of $71 million in 2005. Net interest
income in 2006 included interest income of $661 million,
partially offset by interest expense of $335 million. Net
interest income in 2005 included interest income of
$396 million, partially offset by interest expense of
$325 million. The increase in net interest income is
primarily attributed to an increase in interest income due to
higher average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Funds balances
earning interest at higher rates.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
$41 million in 2006, compared to $1.8 billion in 2005.
In 2006, the $41 million of net gains primarily reflects a
gain of $141 million on the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Telus Corporation, partially offset by a
loss of $126 million on the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Sprint Nextel Corporation (“Sprint
Nextel”). In 2005, the net gains were primarily related to:
(i) a $1.3 billion net gain in connection with the
completion of the merger between Sprint Corporation
(“Sprint”) and Nextel Communications, Inc.
(“Nextel”), and (ii) a $609 million net gain
on the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares of Nextel,
partially offset by a $70 million net loss on the sale of a
portion of the Company’s shares of Sprint Nextel.

Other

Income classified as Other, as presented in Other income
(expense), was $151 million in 2006, compared to net
charges of $109 million in 2005. The net income in 2006 was
primarily comprised of: (i) a $99 million net gain due
to an increase in market value of a zero-cost collar derivative
entered into to protect the value of the Company’s
investment in Sprint Nextel, and (ii) $60 million of
foreign currency gains, partially offset by $27 million of
investment impairment charges. The net charges in 2005 were
primarily comprised of: (i) $137 million of debt
retirement costs, relating to the Company’s repurchase of
an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of long-term
debt through cash tender offers, (ii) $38 million of
foreign currency losses, and (iii) $25 million in
investment impairment charges, partially offset by: (i) a
$51 million gain due to an increase in the market value of
variable forward instruments entered into to protect the
Company’s investment in Nextel common stock prior to the
merger of Sprint and Nextel, and (ii) $30 million in
income from the repayment of a previously-reserved loan related
to Iridium.

Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 29% in 2006, representing a
$1.3 billion net tax expense, compared to 30% in 2005,
representing a $1.9 billion net tax expense. During 2006,
the Company recorded $348 million in net tax benefits,
comprised of: (i) a $186 million tax benefit for the
reduction in deferred tax valuation allowances for its German
and U.K. subsidiaries, (ii) $68 million relating to
incremental net tax benefits realized in 2006 relating to its
2005 repatriations, (iii) a $54 million tax benefit
driven by a mix shift in profits towards lower-tax jurisdictions
that the Company intends to permanently reinvest, (iv) a
$44 million tax benefit for favorable settlements reached
with foreign tax jurisdictions, (v) a $34 million tax
charge for a valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets
on select investments, and (vi) a $30 million
incremental tax benefit relating to the contribution of
appreciated equity holdings to the Company’s charitable
foundation. Additionally, during 2006, the Company incurred
nondeductible IPR&D charges relating to acquisitions and
restructuring charges in low tax jurisdictions that caused an
increase in the Company’s effective tax rate. The
Company’s effective tax rate in 2006, excluding the net tax
benefits, nondeductible IPR&D charges and restructuring
charges in low tax jurisdictions, was 36%.

During 2005, the tax rate reflected a $265 million net tax
benefit related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under
the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and an
$81 million net tax benefit on the stock sale of a sensor
business that was divested in 2005.

Earnings from Continuing Operations

The Company had earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes of $4.6 billion in 2006, compared to earnings
from continuing operations before income taxes of
$6.4 billion in 2005. After taxes, the Company had earnings
from continuing operations of $3.3 billion, or
$1.30 per diluted share, in 2006, compared with earnings
from continuing operations of $4.5 billion, or
$1.79 per diluted share, in 2005.

The decrease in earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributed
to: (i) a $1.8 billion decrease in gains on the sale
of investments and businesses, (ii) an $876 million
increase in SG&A expenses, (iii) a $506 million
increase in R&D expenditures, and (iv) a
$429 million change in Other charges (income). These
negative impacts on operating earnings were partially offset by:
(i) a $1.3 billion increase in gross margin, primarily
due to the $7.6 billion increase in net sales, (ii) a
$260 million increase in income classified as Other, as
presented in Other income (expense), and (iii) a
$255 million increase in net interest income.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations—2005 Compared to 2004

Net Sales

Net sales were $35.3 billion in 2005, up 19% from
$29.7 billion in 2004. Net sales increased in all three of
the Company’s segments in 2005 compared to 2004. The
overall increase in net sales reflected: (i) a
$4.4 billion increase in net sales by the Mobile Devices
segment, driven by a 40% increase in unit shipments, reflecting
strong demand for GSM handsets, (ii) a $737 million
increase in net sales by the Networks and Enterprise segment,
reflecting higher net sales in North America and EMEA, partially
offset by lower net sales in Asia and Latin America, and
(iii) a $536 million increase in net sales by the
Connected Home Solutions segment, primarily driven by increases
in both ASP and unit shipments of digital entertainment devices.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $11.4 billion, or 32.4% of net sales, in
2005, compared to $10.0 billion, or 33.6% of net sales, in
2004. All three of the Company’s operating segment had
higher gross margin in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in
gross margin in the Mobile Devices segment was primarily due to
a 25% increase in net sales, driven by a 40% increase in unit
shipments, partially offset by: (i) a 10% decline in ASP,
and (ii) a charge for past use of Kodak intellectual
property. The increase in gross margin in the Networks and
Enterprise segment was primarily due to: (i) a 7% increase
in net sales, and (ii) improvements in the cost structure
of the public networks business. The increase in gross margin in
the Connected Home Solutions segment was primarily due to a 23%
increase in net sales.

In 2005 compared to 2004, gross margin as a percentage of net
sales: (i) decreased in the Mobile Devices and Connected
Home Solutions segments, and (ii) increased in the Networks
and Enterprise segment. The Company’s overall gross margin
as a percentage of net sales can be impacted by the proportion
of overall net sales generated by its various businesses. The
decrease in overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales in
2005 compared to 2004 can be partially attributed to the fact
that an increased percentage of the Company’s net sales
were generated by the Mobile Devices segment, which generates
lower gross margins than the overall Company average.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses increased 3% to $3.6 billion, or 10.3% of
net sales, in 2005, compared to $3.5 billion, or 11.8% of
net sales, in 2004. The Mobile Devices and Networks and
Enterprise segments had increased SG&A expenses in 2005
compared to 2004. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2005
compared to 2004 was due to: (i) increased marketing
expenses to support higher sales and promote brand awareness,
and (ii) increased selling and sales support expenses,
driven by the increase in sales commissions from the increase in
net sales. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales
decreased, driven by decreases in the Mobile Devices and
Connected Home Solutions segments.

Research and Development Expenditures

R&D expenditures increased 9% to $3.6 billion, or 10.2%
of net sales, in 2005, compared to $3.3 billion, or 11.2%
of net sales, in 2004. All three of the Company’s segments
had increased R&D expenditures in 2005 compared to 2004. The
increase in R&D expenditures was primarily due to
developmental engineering expenditures for new product
development and investment in next-generation technologies
across all segments. R&D expenditures as a percentage of net
sales decreased, driven by decreases in the Mobile Devices and
Networks and Enterprise segments, partially offset by an
increase in the Connected Home Solutions segment.

Other Charges (Income)

The Company recorded net income of $404 million in Other
charges (income) in 2005, compared to net charges of
$149 million in 2004. The net income in 2005 primarily
consisted of $515 million in income for collections
relating to the Telsim settlement, partially offset by:
(i) $67 million of charges relating to the
amortization of intangibles, (ii) $54 million net of
charges for reorganization of businesses, and
(iii) $2 million from acquisition-related IPR&D
charges. The net charges of $149 million in 2004 primarily
consisted of: (i) a $125 million charge for
goodwill impairment, related to the sensor business that was
divested in 2005, (ii) $52 million of charges relating
to the amortization of intangibles, and
(iii) $34 million from acquisition-related IPR&D,
partially offset by: (i) $44 million in income from
the reversal of financing receivable reserves due to the



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

partial collection of the previously-uncollected receivable from
Telsim, and (ii) $11 million of net reorganization of
businesses reversals for reserves no longer needed. The net
reorganization of businesses charges are discussed in further
detail in the “Reorganization of Businesses” section.

Net Interest Income (Expense)

Net interest income was $71 million in 2005, compared to
net interest expense of $200 million in 2004. Net interest
income in 2005 included interest income of $396 million,
partially offset by interest expense of $325 million. Net
interest expense in 2004 included interest expense of
$354 million, partially offset by interest income of
$154 million. The increase in net interest income in 2005
compared to 2004 reflects: (i) an increase in interest
income due to higher average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma
Funds balances earning interest at higher rates, and
(ii) the significantly lower levels of total debt in 2005
compared to 2004.

Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses

Gains on sales of investments and businesses were
$1.8 billion in 2005, compared to $460 million in
2004. The 2005 net gains were primarily: (i) a
$1.3 billion net gain recognized when the Company received
69.3 million shares of Sprint Nextel, as well as
$46 million in cash, in exchange for the Company’s
shares of Nextel when Sprint and Nextel completed their merger
in August 2005, (ii) a $609 million net gain on the
sale of a portion of the Company’s shares of Nextel,
partially offset by a $70 million net loss on the sale of a
portion of the Company’s shares of Sprint Nextel. The
2004 net gains of $460 million were primarily related
to: (i) a $130 million gain on the sale of the
Company’s remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation,
(ii) a $122 million gain on the sale of a portion of
the Company’s shares in Nextel, (iii) an
$82 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Telus Corporation, and (iv) a
$68 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel Partners, Inc.

Other

Charges classified as Other, as presented in Other income
(expense), were $109 million in 2005, compared to
$140 million in 2004. The $109 million of net charges
in 2005 were primarily comprised of: (i) $137 million
of debt retirement costs, relating to the Company’s
repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion
of long-term debt through cash tender offers,
(ii) $38 million of foreign currency losses, and
(iii) $25 million in investment impairment charges,
partially offset by: (i) a $51 million gain due to an
increase in the market value of variable forward instruments
entered into to protect the Company’s investment in Nextel
common stock prior to the merger of Sprint and Nextel, and
(ii) $30 million in income from the repayment of a
previously-reserved loan related to Iridium. The
$140 million of net charges in 2004 was primarily comprised
of: (i) $81 million of charges related to the
redemption of debt, (ii) $44 million of foreign
currency losses, and (iii) $36 million of investment
impairment charges.

Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 30% in 2005, representing a
$1.9 billion net tax expense, compared to a 33% effective
tax rate in 2004, representing a $1.0 billion net tax
expense. The 2005 tax rate reflected a:
(i) $265 million net tax benefit related to the
repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and (ii) an
$81 million net tax benefit on the stock sale of a sensor
business that was divested in 2005.

The 2004 effective tax rate reflected a $241 million
benefit from the reversal of previously-accrued income taxes as
the result of settlements reached with taxing authorities and a
reassessment of tax exposures based on the status of current
audits, offset by: (i) a $125 million of nondeductible
goodwill impairment charges related to the sensor business that
was divested in 2005, and (ii) $31 million of
acquisition-related IPR&D charges.

Earnings from Continuing Operations

The Company had earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes of $6.4 billion in 2005, compared to earnings
from continuing operations before income taxes of
$3.1 billion in 2004. After taxes, the Company had earnings
from continuing operations of $4.5 billion, or
$1.79 per diluted share from continuing operations, in 2005,



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

compared to earnings from continuing operations of
$2.1 billion, or $0.87 per diluted share from
continuing operations, in 2004.

The $3.3 billion increase in earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes is primarily attributed to:
(i) a $1.5 billion increase in gross margin, primarily
due to the $5.6 billion increase in total net sales,
(ii) a $1.4 billion increase in gains on sales of
investments and businesses, (iii) a $553 million
increase in income classified as Other, (iv) a
$271 million increase in net interest income, and
(v) a $31 million decrease in expenses classified as
Other, as presented in Other income (expense). These
improvements in earnings were partially offset by: (i) a
$284 million increase in R&D expenditures, and
(ii) a $120 million increase in SG&A expenses.

Reorganization of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
“Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
and employment grade level in the event that employment is
involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in

-force or
restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in

-force has
qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and,
therefore, such benefits are accounted for in accordance with
Statement No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits” (“SFAS 112”). Under the provisions
of SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefits
based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time
that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably
estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a
restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs
primarily consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated
facilities. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its
accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure
the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances,
accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in
carrying out the plans or because employees previously
identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not
receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not
foreseen when the original plans were initiated. The Company
reverses accruals through the income statement line item where
the original charges were recorded when it is determined they
are no longer required.

The Company realized cost-saving benefits of approximately
$54 million in 2006 from the plans that were initiated
during 2006, representing: (i) $31 million of savings
in R&D expenditures, (ii) $14 million of savings
in SG&A expenses, and (iii) $9 million of savings
in Costs of sales. Beyond 2006, the Company expects the
reorganization plans initiated during 2006 to provide annualized
cost savings of approximately $214 million, representing:
(i) $101 million of savings in R&D expenditures,
(ii) $72 million of savings in SG&A expenses, and
(iii) $41 million of savings in Cost of sales.

2006 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
committed to implement various productivity improvement plans
aimed principally at: (i) reducing costs in its
supply-chain activities, (ii) integrating the former
Networks segment and Government and Enterprise Mobility
Solutions segment into one organization, the Networks and
Enterprise segment, and (iii) reducing other operating
expenses, primarily relating to engineering and development
costs. The Company recorded net reorganization of business
charges of $213 million, including $41 million of
charges in Costs of sales and $172 million of charges under
Other charges in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. Included in the aggregate $213 million are
charges of $191 million for employee separation costs,
$15 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
$30 million for exit costs, partially offset by
$23 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.
Total employees impacted by the actions committed to in 2006 are
3,900.

The following table displays the net reorganization of business
charges by segment:

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
$50 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2006 additional charges of $30 million
were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Networks
and Enterprise segment. The 2006 adjustments of $7 million
represent reversals of accruals no longer needed. The
$19 million used in 2006 reflects cash payments to lessors.
The remaining accrual of $54 million, which is included in
Accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2006, represents future cash payments
for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
$53 million for employee separation costs, representing the
severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees, of which
1,100 were direct employees and 500 were indirect employees. The
2006 additional charges of $191 million represent costs for
an additional 3,900 employees, of which 1,700 were direct
employees and 2,200 were indirect employees. The adjustments of
$16 million represent reversals of accruals no longer
needed.

During 2006, approximately 3,200 employees, of which 1,400 were
direct employees and 1,800 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $124 million used in 2006
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $104 million, which is included in
Accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2006, is expected to be paid to
approximately 2,300 employees to be separated in 2007.

2005 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
recorded net reorganization of business charges of
$91 million, including $37 million of charges in Costs
of sales and $54 million of charges under Other charges in
the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
Included in the aggregate $91 million are charges of
$86 million for employee separation costs and
$15 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
$5 million for exit costs, partially offset by
$15 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.
Total employees impacted by these action were approximately
2,600.

Exit Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$73 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2005 additional charges of $5 million
were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Networks
and Enterprise segment. The 2005 adjustments of $7 million
represented reversals of $1 million for accruals no longer
needed and $6 million of translation adjustments. The
$21 million used in 2005 reflected cash payments to
lessors. The remaining accrual of $50 million, which was
included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$41 million for employee separation costs, representing the
severance costs for approximately 400 employees, of which 50
were direct employees and 350 were indirect employees. The 2005
additional charges of $86 million represented the severance
costs for approximately 2,600 employees, of which 1,300 were
direct employees and 1,300 were indirect employees. The
adjustments of $14 million represented reversals of
accruals no longer needed.

During 2005, approximately 1,400 employees, of which 300 were
direct employees and 1,100 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $60 million used in 2005
reflected cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $53 million was included in Accrued
liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2005.

2004 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
recorded net reorganization of business reversals of
$15 million, including $4 million of reversals in
Costs of sales and $11 million of reversals under Other
charges in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. Included in the aggregate $15 million are
charges of $54 million for employee separation costs,
partially offset by $63 million of reversals for accruals
no longer needed and $6 million for fixed asset adjustment
income. Total employees impacted by these actions were
approximately 800.

separation costs from January 1, 2004 to December 31,
2004:

(1)

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs—Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$122 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2004 adjustments of $18 million
represented reversals of $29 million for accruals no longer
needed, partially offset by an $11 million translation
adjustment. The $31 million used in 2004 reflected cash
payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of $73 million,
which was included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$116 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 2,100 employees, of which
1,000 were direct employees and 1,100 were indirect employees.
The 2004 additional charges of $54 million represented the
severance costs for approximately 800 employees, of which 100
were direct employees and 700 were indirect employees. The
adjustments of $34 million represented reversals of
accruals no longer needed.

During 2004, approximately 2,500 employees, of which 1,000 were
direct employees and 1,500 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $95 million used in 2004
reflected cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $41 million was included in Accrued
liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are
impacted by four key components: (i) current cash and cash
equivalents, (ii) operating activities,
(iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing
activities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

During 2006, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents (which
are highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less) decreased by $562 million to
$3.2 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to
$3.8 billion at December 31, 2005. At
December 31, 2006, $300 million of this amount was
held in the U.S. and $2.9 billion was held by the Company
or its subsidiaries in other countries.

The Company has approximately $2.5 billion of earnings in
foreign subsidiaries that are not permanently reinvested and may
be repatriated without additional U.S. federal income tax
charges to the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations, given the U.S. federal tax provisions accrued
on undistributed earnings and the utilization of available
foreign tax credits. On a cash basis, these repatriations from
the Company’s

non-U.S.

subsidiaries
could require the payment of additional foreign taxes, which
would be creditable against U.S. federal income taxes. The
repatriation of some of these funds could also be subject to
delay for local country approvals.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Operating Activities

The Company has generated positive cash flow from continuing
operations in each of the last six years. The cash provided by
operating activities from continuing operations in 2006 was
$3.5 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in 2005 and
$2.9 billion in 2004. The primary contributors to cash flow
from operations in 2006 were: (i) earnings from continuing
operations (adjusted for non-cash items) of $4.9 billion,
and (ii) a $1.7 billion increase in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities. These positive contributors to
operating cash flow were partially offset by: (i) a
$1.8 billion increase in accounts receivable, (ii) a
$718 million increase in inventories, (iii) a
$388 million increase in other current assets, and
(iv)a $215 million increase in other assets and other
liabilities.

Accounts Receivable:

The Company’s net accounts
receivable were $7.5 billion at December 31, 2006,
compared to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The
Company’s days sales outstanding (“DSO”),
including net long-term receivables, were 58 days at
December 31, 2006, compared to 51 days at
December 31, 2005. The Company’s businesses sell their
products in a variety of markets throughout the world. Payment
terms can vary by market type and geographic location.
Accordingly, the Company’s levels of accounts receivable
and DSO can be impacted by the timing and level of sales that
are made by its various businesses and by the geographic
locations in which those sales are made.

Inventory:

The Company’s net inventory was
$3.2 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2005. Inventory balances
increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to: (i) slower
than expected initial customer demand for certain products,
(ii) an increase in inventory to fulfill longer-term
projects, and (iii) a business acquisition. The
Company’s inventory turns decreased to 11.0 at
December 31, 2006, compared to 11.3 at December 31,
2005, primarily due to slower than expected initial customer
demand for certain products. Inventory turns were calculated
using an annualized rolling three months of cost of sales
method. Inventory management continues to be an area of focus as
the Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory
levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its
customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to
rapidly changing technology and customer spending requirements.

Reorganization of Businesses:

The Company has implemented
reorganization of businesses plans. Cash payments for exit costs
and employee separations in connection with these plans were
$143 million in 2006, as compared to $81 million in
2005. Of the $158 million reorganization of businesses
accrual at December 31, 2006, $104 million relates to
employee separation costs and is expected to be paid in 2007.
The remaining $54 million in accruals relate to lease
termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a
number of years.

Defined Benefit Plan Contributions:

The Company
contributed $276 million to its U.S. pension plans during
2006, compared to $308 million contributed in 2005. The
Company contributed $122 million to its non-U.S. pension
plans during 2006, compared to $62 million contributed in
2005. During 2007, the Company expects to make cash
contributions of approximately $280 million to its
U.S. pension plans and approximately $120 million to
its

non-U.S.

pension
plans. The Company contributed $27 million to its retiree
health care plan in 2006, compared to $43 million in 2005,
and expects to contribute $24 million to this plan in 2007.
Retirement-related benefits are further discussed below in the
“Significant Accounting Policies—Retirement-Related
Benefits” section.

Investing Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s investing
activities include: (i) proceeds from sales of investments
and businesses, (ii) purchases of Sigma Funds investments,
(iii) strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, other
companies, and (iv) capital expenditures.

Net cash used for investing activities from continuing
operations was $1.0 billion in 2006, as compared to net
cash used of $2.4 billion in 2005 and $1.6 billion in
2004. This $1.3 billion decrease in cash used for investing
activities from continuing operations was due to: (i) a
$1.8 billion decrease in cash used for the purchase of
Sigma Funds investments, and (ii) a $463 million
increase in proceeds from the sales of investments and
businesses, partially offset by: (i) a $756 million
increase in cash used for acquisitions and investments,
(ii) a $101 million increase in capital expenditures,
(iii) an $88 million increase in purchases of
short-term investments, and (iv) an $18 million
decrease in proceeds received from the disposition of property,
plant and equipment. The $1.6 billion in cash used for
investing activities from continuing operations in 2004 was
primarily due to the initial purchase of Sigma Funds investments.

Sales of Investments and Businesses:

The Company received
$2.0 billion in proceeds from the sales of investments and
businesses in 2006, compared to proceeds of $1.5 billion in
2005 and $682 million in 2004. The



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

$2.0 billion in proceeds in 2006 were primarily comprised
of: (i) $856 million in net proceeds from the sale of
the automotive electronics business, (ii) $820 million
from the sale of the Company’s remaining shares in Sprint
Nextel Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) and the
termination and cash settlement of a zero-cost collar derivative
relating to these Sprint Nextel shares (the “Sprint Nextel
Derivative”), and (iii) $175 million from the
sale of the Company’s remaining shares in Telus
Corporation. The $1.5 billion in proceeds generated in 2005
were primarily comprised of: (i) $679 million from the
sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Nextel
Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”) during the first half
of 2005, (ii) $391 million from the sale of a portion
of the Company’s shares in Sprint Nextel during the fourth
quarter of 2005, (iii) $232 million from the sale of a
portion of the Company’s shares in Semiconductor
Manufacturing International Corporation, and
(iv) $96 million received in connection with the
merger of Sprint Corporation and Nextel.

Sigma Funds:

The Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries invest most of their excess cash in two funds (the
“Sigma Funds”), which are funds similar to a money
market fund. The Company used $1.3 billion in net cash for
the purchase of Sigma Funds investments in 2006, compared to
$3.2 billion in net cash used in 2005. The Sigma Funds
aggregate balances were $12.2 billion at December 31,
2006, compared to $10.9 billion at December 31, 2005.
At December 31, 2006, $8.7 billion of the Sigma Funds
investments were held in the U.S. and $3.5 billion were
held by the Company or its subsidiaries in other countries.
Repatriation of some of these funds could be subject to delay
and could have potential adverse tax consequences.

The Sigma Funds portfolios are managed by five major outside
investment management firms and include investments in high
quality (rated at least A/ A-1 by S&P or A2/ P-1 by
Moody’s at purchase date), U.S. dollar-denominated
debt obligations including certificates of deposit,
bankers’ acceptances and fixed time deposits, government
obligations, asset-backed securities and commercial paper or
short-term corporate obligations. The Sigma Funds investment
policies require that the acquired floating rate instruments
must have a maturity at purchase date that does not exceed
thirty-six months with an interest rate reset at least annually.
The average maturity of the investments held by the funds must
be 120 days or less with the actual average maturity of the
investments being 53 days and 74 days at
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
Certain investments with maturities beyond one year have been
classified as short-term based on their highly-liquid nature and
because such marketable securities represent the investment of
cash that is available for current operations.

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:

The Company used
cash for acquisitions and new investment activities of
$1.1 billion in 2006, compared to cash used of
$312 million in 2005 and $476 million in 2004. The
largest components of the $1.1 billion in 2006 expenditures
were: (i) $300 million for an equity investment in
Clearwire, Inc., (ii) $193 million for the acquisition
of TTP Communications plc by the Mobile Devices segment,
(iii) $181 million for the acquisition of Broadbus
Technologies, Inc. by the Connected Home Solutions segment,
(iv) $108 million for the acquisition of Kreatel
Communications AB by the Connected Home Solutions segment,
(v) the acquisition of Orthogon Systems by the Networks and
Enterprise segment, and (vi) the acquisition of NextNet
Wireless, Inc. by the Networks and Enterprise segment. The
largest components of the $312 million in 2005 expenditures
were: (i) the acquisition of the remaining interest of MIRS
Communications Israel LTD. by the Networks and Enterprise
segment, (ii) the acquisition of Wireless Valley
Communications, Inc. by the Networks and Enterprise segment,
(iii) the acquisition of certain IP assets and R&D
workforce from Sendo by the Mobile Devices segment,
(iv) the acquisition of Ucentric Systems, Inc. by the
Connected Home Solutions segment, and (v) the funding of
joint ventures formed by Motorola and Comcast that focus on
developing the next-generation of conditional access technologies

In early 2007, Motorola completed three strategic acquisitions
for a net aggregate of approximately $4.2 billion in cash
(reflecting an aggregate of approximately $4.6 billion of
cash spent less an aggregate of approximately $400 million
of cash acquired in the acquisitions). Symbol Technologies, Inc.
was acquired by the Networks and Enterprise segment in January
2007 for approximately $3.9 billion in cash. Good
Technology, Inc. was acquired by the Mobile Devices segment in
January 2007 for approximately $500 million in cash.
Netopia, Inc. was acquired by



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

the Connected Home Solutions segment in February 2007 for
approximately $200 million in cash. The following table
displays the relative impact of the early 2007 acquisitions on
Motorola’s domestic and non-U.S. balances:

Summary of Cash Impact from Early 2007 Acquisitions

*

As described above, in early 2007, Motorola used an aggregate
    net of approximately $4.2 billion of cash (reflecting
    approximately $4.6 billion of cash spent less approximately
    $400 million of cash acquired from the acquisitions) to
    complete three strategic acquisitions. The cash used for these
    acquisitions was held in the U.S. and primarily came from the
    liquidation of Sigma Funds investments held in the U.S. A
    portion of the cash acquired in these acquisitions was outside
    of the U.S.

Capital Expenditures:

Capital expenditures were
$649 million in 2006, compared to $548 million in 2005
and $405 million in 2004. The Company’s emphasis in
making capital expenditures is to focus on strategic investments
driven by customer demand and new design capability.

Short-Term Investments:

At December 31, 2006, the
Company had $224 million in short-term investments (which
are highly-liquid fixed-income investments with an original
maturity greater than three months but less than one year),
compared to $144 million of short-term investments at
December 31, 2005.

Available-For-Sale Securities:

In addition to available
cash and cash equivalents, Sigma Funds and short-term
investments, the Company views its available-for-sale securities
as an additional source of liquidity. The majority of these
securities represent investments in technology companies and,
accordingly, the fair market values of these securities are
subject to substantial price volatility. In addition, the
realizable value of these securities is subject to market and
other conditions. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s
available-for-sale securities portfolio had an approximate fair
market value of $130 million, which represented a cost
basis of $70 million and a net unrealized gain of
$60 million. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s
available-for-sale securities portfolio had an approximate fair
market value of $1.2 billion, which represented a cost
basis of $1.1 billion and a net unrealized gain of
$157 million.

Sprint Nextel Investment:

During the first quarter of
2006, the Company entered into the Sprint Nextel Derivative to
protect itself economically against price fluctuations in its
37.6 million shares of Sprint Nextel non-voting common
stock. During the second quarter of 2006, as a result of Sprint
Nextel’s spin-off of Embarq Corporation through a dividend
to Sprint Nextel shareholders, the Company received
approximately 1.9 million shares of Embarq Corporation. The
floor and ceiling prices of the Sprint Nextel Derivative were
adjusted accordingly. The Sprint Nextel Derivative was not
designated as a hedge under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”
Accordingly, to reflect the change in fair value of the Sprint
Nextel Derivative, the Company recorded a net gain of
$99 million for the full year ending December 31,
2006, included in Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations.

In December 2006, the Sprint Nextel Derivative was terminated
and settled in cash and the 37.6 million shares of Sprint
Nextel were converted to common shares and sold. The Company
received aggregate cash proceeds of approximately
$820 million from the settlement of the Sprint Nextel
Derivative and the subsequent sale of the 37.6 million
Sprint Nextel Shares. The Company recognized a loss of
$126 million in connection with the sale of the remaining
shares of Sprint Nextel common stock. As described above, the
Company recorded a net gain of $99 million in connection
with the Sprint Nextel Derivative.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financing Activities

The most significant components of the Company’s financing
activities are: (i) the purchase of the Company’s
common stock under its share repurchase program,
(ii) proceeds from the issuances of stock due to the
exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the
employee stock purchase plan, (iii) the payment of
dividends, (iv) excess tax benefits from share-based
compensation, (v) net proceeds from commercial paper and
short-term borrowings, (vi) distributions to discontinued
operations, and (vii) repayment of debt.

Net cash used for financing activities from continuing
operations was $3.2 billion in 2006, compared to
$907 million of cash used in 2005 and $153 million of
cash used in 2004. Cash used for financing activities from
continuing operations in 2006 was primarily:
(i) $3.8 billion of cash used for purchases of the
Company’s common stock under the share repurchase program,
(ii) $443 million of cash used to pay dividends, and
(iii) $23 million paid to discontinued operations for
interim funding requirements associated with the automotive
electronics business prior to the sale, partially offset by
proceeds of: (i) $918 million received from the
issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s
employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan,
(ii) $165 million in excess tax benefits from
share-based compensation, and (iii) $66 million in net
proceeds from commercial paper and short-term borrowings.

Cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in
2005 was primarily attributable to: (i) $1.1 billion
of cash used to repay debt, (ii) $874 million of cash
used for purchases of the Company’s common stock under the
share repurchase program, and (iii) $394 million of
cash used to pay dividends, partially offset by proceeds of
$1.2 billion received from the issuance of common stock in
connection with the Company’s employee stock option plans
and employee stock purchase plan.

Short-term Debt:

At December 31, 2006, the
Company’s outstanding notes payable and current portion of
long-term debt was $1.7 billion, compared to
$448 million at December 31, 2005. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, $1.2 billion of 4.608% Senior Notes
due November 16, 2007 (the “2007
4.608% Notes”) were reclassified to current portion of
long-term debt.

Net cash proceeds from the sale of commercial paper and
short-term borrowings were $66 million in 2006, compared to
$11 million in 2005. The Company had $300 million of
outstanding commercial paper on both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Long-term Debt:

At December 31, 2006, the Company
had outstanding long-term debt of $2.7 billion, compared to
$3.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The change can be
primarily attributed to the reclassification to current portion
of long-term debt of the $1.2 billion of 2007
4.608% Notes.

Redemptions and Repurchases of Outstanding Debt
Securities:

In January 2007, the Company repaid, at
maturity, all $118 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding of its 7.6% Notes due January 1, 2007.

In September 2005, the Company repurchased an aggregate
principal amount of $1.0 billion of its outstanding
long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of
$1.1 billion through cash tender offers. Included in the
$1.0 billion of long-term debt repurchased were repurchases
of a principal amount of: (i) $86 million of the
$200 million of 6.50% Notes due 2008 outstanding,
(ii) $241 million of the $325 million of
5.80% Notes due 2008 outstanding, and
(iii) $673 million of the $1.2 billion of
7.625% Notes due 2010 outstanding. In addition, the Company
terminated a notional amount of $1.0 billion

fixed-to

-floating
interest rate swaps associated with the debt repurchased,
resulting in an expense of approximately $22 million. The
aggregate charge for the repurchase of the debt and the
termination of the associated interest rate swaps, as presented
in Other income (expense), was $137 million.

On September 1, 2005, the Company retired $1 million
of the $398 million of the 2025 Debentures in connection
with the holders of the debentures right to put their debentures
back to the Company. The residual put options expired
unexercised and the remaining $397 million of 2025
Debentures were reclassified back to long-term debt.

The Company may from time to time seek to opportunistically
retire certain of its outstanding debt through open market cash
purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such
repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market
conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements,
contractual restrictions and other factors.

Share Repurchase Program:

In May 2005, the Board of
Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to
$4.0 billion of its outstanding common stock over a period
of up to 36 months ending in May 2008, subject to



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

market conditions (the “2005 Stock Repurchase
Program”). In July 2006, the Company entered into an
accelerated stock buyback agreement to repurchase approximately
$1.2 billion of its outstanding common stock
(“ASB”). In October 2006, the Company received the
final distribution of shares under the ASB. The total shares
purchased under the ASB were 50.5 million shares. The ASB
completed the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program.

On July 24, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the
Company to repurchase up to an additional $4.5 billion of
its outstanding shares of common stock over a period of up to 36
months ending in June 2009, subject to market conditions
(the “2006 Stock Repurchase Program”). In the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company purchased $700 million of
shares under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program.

The Company repurchased a total of 171.7 million common
shares (including shares received under the ASB) at a cost of
$3.8 billion in 2006. The Company repurchased a total of
41.7 million common shares at a cost of $874 million
in 2005. All repurchased shares have been retired.

Credit Ratings:

Three independent credit rating agencies,
Fitch Investors Service (“Fitch”), Moody’s
Investor Services (“Moody’s”), and
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), assign
ratings to the Company’s short-term and long-term debt. The
following chart reflects the current ratings assigned to the
Company’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term
debt and the Company’s commercial paper by each of these
agencies.

In October 2006, Moody’s upgraded the Company’s
long-term debt rating to “Baa1” with a positive
outlook from “Baa2” with a stable outlook.
Moody’s also affirmed the Company’s “P-2”
short-term debt rating. There were no other changes in the
Company’s debt ratings during the fourth quarter of 2006.

The Company’s debt ratings are considered “investment
grade.” If the Company’s senior long-term debt were
rated lower than “BBB-” by S&P or Fitch or
“Baa3” by Moody’s (which would be a decline of
three levels from current Moody’s ratings), the
Company’s long-term debt would no longer be considered
“investment grade.” If this were to occur, the terms
on which the Company could borrow money would become more
onerous. The Company would also have to pay higher fees related
to its domestic revolving credit facility. The Company has never
borrowed under its domestic revolving credit facilities.

The Company continues to have access to the commercial paper and
long-term debt markets. The Company has maintained commercial
paper balances of between $300 million and
$400 million for the past four years.

As further described under “Customer Financing
Arrangements” below, for many years the Company has
utilized a number of receivables programs to sell a
broadly-diversified group of short-term receivables to third
parties. Certain of the short-term receivables are sold to a
multi-seller commercial paper conduit. This program provides for
up to $500 million of short-term receivables to be
outstanding with the conduit at any time. The obligations of the
conduit to continue to purchase receivables under this
short-term receivables program could be terminated if the
Company’s long-term debt was rated lower than
“BB+” by S&P or “Ba1” by Moody’s
(which would be a decline of four levels from the current
Moody’s rating). If this short-term receivables program
were terminated, the Company would no longer be able to sell its
short-term receivables to the conduit in this manner, but it
would not have to repurchase previously-sold receivables.

Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s total domestic and

non-U.S.

credit
facilities totaled $4.0 billion, of which $175 million
was considered utilized. These facilities are principally
comprised of: (i) a $2.0 billion five-year revolving
domestic credit facility maturing in December 2011 (the

“5-Year

Credit
Facility”) which is not utilized, and
(ii) $2.0 billion of

non-U.S.

credit
facilities (of which $175 million was considered utilized
at December 31, 2006). The

5-Year

Credit Facility
replaced the Company’s former $1.0 billion three-year
revolving domestic credit facility, which was scheduled to
mature in May 2007. Unused availability under the existing
credit facilities, together with available cash, cash
equivalents, Sigma Funds balances and other sources of
liquidity, are generally available to support outstanding
commercial paper, which was $300 million at
December 31, 2006.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In order to borrow funds under the

5-Year

Credit Facility,
the Company must be in compliance with various conditions,
covenants and representations contained in the agreements. The
Company was in compliance with the terms of the

5-Year

Credit Facility
at December 31, 2006. The Company has never borrowed under
its domestic revolving credit facilities. Utilization of the

non-U.S.

credit
facilities may also be dependent on the Company’s ability
to meet certain conditions at the time a borrowing is requested.

Contractual Obligations, Guarantees, and Other Purchase
Commitments

Contractual Obligations

Summarized in the table below are the Company’s obligations
and commitments to make future payments under debt obligations
(assuming earliest possible exercise of put rights by holders),
lease payment obligations, and purchase obligations as of
December 31, 2006.

(1)

Amounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments.

Debt Obligations:

At December 31, 2006, the
Company’s long-term debt obligations, including current
maturities and unamortized discount and issue costs, totaled
$4.1 billion, as compared to $4.0 billion at
December 31, 2005. A table of all outstanding long-term
debt securities can be found in Note 4, “Debt and
Credit Facilities,” to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Lease Obligations:

The Company owns most of its major
facilities, but does lease certain office, factory and warehouse
space, land, and information technology and other equipment
under principally non-cancelable operating leases. At
December 31, 2006, future minimum lease obligations, net of
minimum sublease rentals, totaled $2.3 billion. Rental
expense, net of sublease income, was $241 million in 2006,
$250 million in 2005 and $205 million in 2004.

Purchase Obligations:

The Company has entered into
agreements for the purchase of inventory, license of software,
promotional agreements, and research and development agreements
which are firm commitments and are not cancelable. The longest
of these agreements extends through 2015. Total payments
expected to be made under these agreements total
$1.0 billion.

Commitments Under Other Long-Term Agreements:

The Company
has entered into certain long-term agreements to purchase
software, components, supplies and materials from suppliers.
Most of the agreements extend for periods of one to three years
(three to five years for software). However, generally these
agreements do not obligate the Company to make any purchases,
and many permit the Company to terminate the agreement with
advance notice (usually ranging from 60 to 180 days). If
the Company were to terminate these agreements, it generally
would be liable for certain termination charges, typically based
on work performed and supplier on-hand inventory and raw
materials attributable to canceled orders. The Company’s
liability would only arise in the event it terminates the
agreements for reasons other than “cause.”

The Company also enters into a number of arrangements for the
sourcing of supplies and materials with minimum purchase
commitments and

take-or-pay

obligations. The majority of the minimum purchase obligations
under these contracts are over the life of the contract as
opposed to a year-by-year

take-or-pay.

If these
agreements were terminated at December 31, 2006, the
Company’s obligation would not have been significant. The
Company does not anticipate the cancellation of any of these
agreements in the future. Subsequent to the end of 2006, the
Company entered into

take-or-pay

arrangements with suppliers through May 2009 with minimum
purchase obligations of $2.2 billion during that period.
The Company estimates purchases during that period that exceed
the minimum obligations.

The Company outsources certain corporate functions, such as
benefit administration and information technology-related
services. These contracts are expected to expire in 2013. The
total remaining payments under these contracts are approximately
$1.3 billion over the remaining seven years; however,
these contracts can be



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

terminated. Termination would result in a penalty substantially
less than the remaining annual contract payments. The Company
would also be required to find another source for these
services, including the possibility of performing them in-house.

As is customary in bidding for and completing network
infrastructure projects and pursuant to a practice the Company
has followed for many years, the Company has a number of
performance/bid bonds and standby letters of credit outstanding,
primarily relating to projects of the Networks and Enterprise
segment. These instruments normally have maturities of up to
three years and are standard in the industry as a way to give
customers a convenient mechanism to seek resolution if a
contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a
contract. A customer can draw on the instrument only if the
Company does not fulfill all terms of a project contract. If
such an occasion occurred, the Company would be obligated to
reimburse the financial institution that issued the bond or
letter of credit for the amounts paid. The Company is not
generally required to post any cash in connection with the
issuance of these bonds or letters of credit. In its long
history, it has been extraordinarily uncommon for the Company to
have a performance/bid bond or standby letter of credit drawn
upon. At December 31, 2006, outstanding performance/bid
bonds and standby letters of credit totaled approximately
$1.5 billion, compared to $1.0 billion at the end of
2005.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

Under the definition
contained in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
Regulation

S-K,

the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Adequate Internal and External Funding Resources

The Company believes that it has adequate internal and external
resources available to fund expected working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for the next twelve months as supported
by the level of cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Funds in the
U.S., the ability to repatriate cash, cash equivalents and Sigma
Funds from foreign jurisdictions, the ability to borrow under
existing or future credit facilities, the ability to issue
commercial paper, and access to the short-term and long-term
debt markets.

Customer Financing Commitments and Guarantees

Outstanding Commitments:

Certain purchasers of the
Company’s infrastructure equipment continue to request that
suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment
purchases. These requests may include all or a portion of the
purchase price of the equipment. Periodically, the Company makes
commitments to provide financing to purchasers in connection
with the sale of equipment. However, the Company’s
obligation to provide financing is often conditioned on the
issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a
reputable bank to support the purchaser’s credit or a
pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the
receivable from the Company. The Company had outstanding
commitments to extend credit to third-parties totaling
$398 million at December 31, 2006, compared to
$689 million at December 31, 2005. Of these amounts,
$262 million was supported by letters of credit or by bank
commitments to purchase receivables at December 31, 2006,
compared to $594 million at December 31, 2005.

Guarantees of Third-Party Debt:

In addition to providing
direct financing to certain equipment customers, the Company
also assists customers in obtaining financing directly from
banks and other sources to fund equipment purchases. The Company
had committed to provide financial guarantees relating to
customer financing totaling $122 million and
$140 million at December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, respectively (including $19 million
and $66 million, respectively, relating to the sale of
short-term receivables). Customer financing guarantees
outstanding were $47 million and $79 million at
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively
(including $2 million and $42 million, respectively,
relating to the sale of short-term receivables).

Customer Financing Arrangements

Outstanding Finance Receivables:

The Company had net
finance receivables of $269 million at December 31,
2006, compared to $260 million at December 31, 2005
(net of allowances for losses of $10 million at
December 31, 2006 and $12 million at December 31,
2005). These finance receivables are generally interest bearing,
with rates ranging from 2% to 11%. Interest income recognized on
finance receivables for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 was $9 million, $7 million and
$9 million, respectively.

Telsim Loan:

On October 28, 2005, the Company
entered into an agreement to resolve disputes regarding Telsim
Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. (“Telsim”) with
Telsim and the government of Turkey. The



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

government of Turkey and the Turkish Savings and Deposit
Insurance Fund (“TMSF”) are third-party beneficiaries
of the settlement agreement. In settlement of its claims, the
Company received $410 million in cash in 2006 and
$500 million in 2005. The Company is permitted to, and will
continue to, enforce its U.S. court judgment against the
Uzan family, except in Turkey and three other countries.

Sales of Receivables and Loans:

From time to time, the
Company sells short-term receivables, long-term loans and lease
receivables under sales-type leases (collectively, “finance
receivables”) to third parties in transactions that qualify
as “true-sales.” Certain of these finance receivables
are sold to third parties on a one-time, non-recourse basis,
while others are sold to third parties under committed
facilities that involve contractual commitments from these
parties to purchase qualifying receivables up to an outstanding
monetary limit. Committed facilities may be revolving in nature.
Certain sales may be made through separate legal entities that
are also consolidated by the Company. The Company may or may not
retain the obligation to service the sold finance receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2006, these committed
facilities provided for up to $1.3 billion to be
outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
up to $1.1 billion provided at December 31, 2005 and
up to $724 million provided at December 31, 2004. As
of December 31, 2006, $817 million of these committed
facilities were utilized, compared to $585 million utilized
at December 31, 2005 and $305 million utilized at
December 31, 2004. Certain events could cause one of these
facilities to terminate. In addition, before receivables can be
sold under certain of the committed facilities, they may need to
meet contractual requirements, such as credit quality or
insurability.

Total finance receivables sold by the Company were
$6.4 billion in 2006 (including $6.2 billion of
short-term receivables), compared to $4.5 billion sold in
2005 (including $4.2 billion of short-term receivables) and
$3.8 billion sold in 2004 (including $3.8 billion of
short-term receivables). As of December 31, 2006, there
were $1.1 billion of receivables outstanding under these
programs for which the Company retained servicing obligations
(including $789 million of short-term receivables),
compared to $1.0 billion outstanding at December 31,
2005 (including $838 million of short-term receivables) and
$720 million outstanding at December 31, 2004
(including $589 of short-term receivables).

Under certain of the receivables programs, the value of the
receivables sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from
independent insurance companies, less deductibles or
self-insurance requirements under the policies (with the Company
retaining credit exposure for the remaining portion). The
Company’s total credit exposure to outstanding short-term
receivables that have been sold was $19 million at
December 31, 2006 as compared to $66 million at
December 31, 2005. A reserve of $4 million was
recorded for potential losses on sold receivables at both
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005.

Other Contingencies

Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying
Contract Value:

In certain circumstances, our businesses may
enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the
damages that could be claimed by the other party for failed
performance might exceed the revenue the Company receives from
the contract. Contracts with these sorts of uncapped damage
provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still
represent meaningful risk. Although it has not previously
happened to the Company, there is a possibility that a damage
claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result
in expenses to the Company that are far in excess of the revenue
received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.

Legal Matters:

The Company has several lawsuits filed
against it relating to the Iridium program, as further described
under “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” of this
document. The Company has not reserved for any potential
liability that may arise as a result of litigation related to
the Iridium program. While the still pending cases are in
various stages and the outcomes are not predictable, an
unfavorable outcome of one or more of these cases could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

The Company is a defendant in various other lawsuits and is
subject to various claims which arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, and other than discussed
above with respect to the still pending Iridium cases, the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, liquidity or results of operations.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Segment Information

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the
financial results of each reporting segment as detailed in
Note 11, “Information by Segment and Geographic
Region,” to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. Net sales and operating results for the
Company’s three operating segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004
are presented below.

Mobile Devices Segment

The

Mobile Devices

segment designs, manufactures, sells
and services wireless handsets with integrated software and
accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. In 2006,
the segment’s net sales represented 66% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales, compared to 61% in 2005
and 58% in 2004.

Segment Results—2006 Compared to 2005

In 2006, the segment’s net sales increased 32% to
$28.4 billion, compared to $21.5 billion in 2005. The
increase in net sales was driven by a 49% increase in unit
shipments, primarily driven by strong demand for GSM and CDMA
handsets and reflecting consumers’ desire for the
segment’s compelling products that combine innovative style
and leading technology, partially offset by an 11% decrease in
average selling price (“ASP”). On a product technology
basis, net sales of products for GSM and CDMA technologies
increased and net sales of products for iDEN and UMTS
technologies decreased. On a geographic basis, net sales
increased in High Growth markets (defined as countries in the
Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia and India), North Asia,
North America and Latin America, and decreased in Europe.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$2.7 billion in 2006, compared to operating earnings of
$2.2 billion in 2005. The 23% increase in operating
earnings was primarily due to an increase in gross margin,
driven primarily by: (i) the 49% increase in unit
shipments, (ii) savings from supply chain cost-reduction
initiatives, and (iii) increased income from technology and
platform licensing, partially offset by the 11% decline in ASP.
The increase in gross margin was partially offset by:
(i) an increase in selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expenses, primarily driven by an increase
in marketing expenses to support higher net sales and promote
brand awareness, and (ii) an increase in research and
development (“R&D”) expenditures, as a result of
an increase in developmental engineering for new product
development and software, as well as ongoing investment in
next-generation technologies. The segment’s industry
typically experiences short life cycles for new products, so it
is vital to the segment’s success that new, compelling
products are constantly introduced. Therefore, a strong
commitment to R&D is required to fuel long-term growth. As a
percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased and R&D
expenditures decreased as compared to 2005.

The segment’s backlog was $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2006, compared to $3.0 billion at
December 31, 2005. This decrease in backlog is primarily
due to an unusually high level of backlog at December 31,
2005 due to strong customer demand for new products during the
fourth quarter of 2005, certain of which were unable to be
shipped in significant quantities due to supply constraints for
select components.

Unit shipments increased 49% to 217.4 million units in
2006, compared to 146.0 million units in 2005. The overall
increase was driven by increased unit shipments of products for
GSM, CDMA and UMTS technologies, partially offset by decreased
unit shipments of products for iDEN technology. For the full
year 2006, unit shipments by the segment increased in all
regions. Due to the segment’s increase in unit shipments
outpacing overall growth in the worldwide handset market, which
grew approximately 20% in 2006, the segment believes that it
expanded its global handset market share to an estimated 22% in
2006.

In 2006, ASP decreased approximately 11% compared to 2005. The
overall decrease in ASP was driven primarily by an unfavorable
geographic and product-tier mix. By comparison, ASP decreased
approximately 10% in 2005 and increased approximately 15% in
2004. ASP is impacted by numerous factors, including product
mix, market conditions and competitive product offerings, and
ASP trends often vary over time.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The largest of the segment’s end customers (including sales
through distributors) are China Mobile, Verizon, Sprint Nextel,
Cingular, and

T-Mobile.

These five largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of
the segment’s net sales in 2006. Besides selling directly
to carriers and operators, the segment also sells products
through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers,
which account for approximately 38% of the segment’s net
sales. The largest of these distributors is Brightstar
Corporation. The loss of any of the segment’s key customers
could have a significant impact on the segment’s business.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
65% of our segment’s 2006 net sales, were outside the
U.S. The largest of these international markets are China,
Brazil, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Hong Kong.

During 2006, the segment completed the acquisition of TTP
Communications plc, a developer of intellectual property used in
the design and manufacture of wireless communication terminals
and a leading provider of protocol stack software that offers
rapid customization of handsets through its AJAR applications
framework. Subsequent to the end of 2006, the segment completed
the acquisition of Good Technology, Inc., a leader in enterprise
mobile computing software and service.

Segment Results—2005 Compared to 2004

In 2005, the segment’s net sales increased 25% to
$21.5 billion, compared to $17.1 billion in 2004. The
increase in net sales was driven by a 40% increase in unit
shipments in 2005, reflecting strong consumer demand for GSM
handsets. The segment had increased net sales in all regions as
a result of an improved product portfolio, strong market growth
in emerging markets and high replacement sales in more mature
markets.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$2.2 billion in 2005, compared to operating earnings of
$1.7 billion in 2004. The 27% increase in operating
earnings was primarily related to an increase in gross margin,
driven by the 25% increase in net sales. The improvement in
gross margin was partially offset by: (i) an increase in
SG&A expenses, primarily driven by increased marketing
expenses to support higher net sales and brand awareness, and
(ii) an increase in R&D expenditures, as a result of
increased investment in new product development. As a percentage
of net sales, both R&D expenditures and SG&A expenses
decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004.

The segment’s backlog was $3.0 billion at
December 31, 2005, compared to $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2004. During 2005, the segment had strong
order growth and backlog increased due to: (i) strong
customer demand for new products during the fourth quarter of
2005, certain of which were unable to be shipped in significant
quantities due to supply constraints for select components, and
(ii) the segment’s higher level of general order input
in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of
2004.

Unit shipments increased 40% to 146.0 million in 2005,
compared to 104.5 million in 2004. The increase in unit
shipments was attributed to broad acceptance of the
segment’s product offering, particularly a strong demand
for GSM handsets. For the full year 2005, unit shipments by the
segment increased in all regions. Due to the segment’s
increase in unit shipments outpacing overall growth in the
worldwide handset market, which grew approximately 17% in 2005,
the segment believes that it expanded its global market share to
an estimated 18% in 2005.

In 2005, ASP decreased approximately 10% compared to 2004. The
overall decrease in ASP was driven primarily by a higher
percentage of lower-tier, lower-priced handsets in the overall
sales mix. By comparison, ASP increased approximately 15% in
2004 and declined approximately 8% in 2003.

The largest of the segment’s end customers (including sales
through distributors) were Sprint Nextel, Cingular, China
Mobile, América Móvil and

T-Mobile.

These five
largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of the
segment’s net sales in 2005. During 2005, purchases of
iDEN

®

products by Sprint Nextel comprised approximately 13% of the
segment’s net sales. Besides selling directly to carriers
and operators, the segment also sells products through a variety
of third-party distributors and retailers, which account for
approximately 36% of the segment’s net sales. The largest
of these distributors was Brightstar Corporation.

Although the U.S. market continued to be the segment’s
largest individual market, many of our customers, and more than
63% of our segment’s 2005 net sales, were outside the
U.S. The largest of these international markets were China,
the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany and Mexico.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Networks and Enterprise Segment

The

Networks and Enterprise

segment designs,
manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) cellular
infrastructure systems and wireless broadband systems to public
carriers and other wireless service providers (referred to as
the “public networks” market), and (ii) analog
and digital two-way radio, voice and data communications
products and systems, as well as wireless broadband systems, to
a wide range of public safety, government, utility,
transportation and other worldwide enterprise markets (referred
to as the “private networks” market). In January 2007,
the segment completed the acquisition of Symbol Technologies
Inc. (“Symbol”), a leader in designing, developing,
manufacturing and servicing products and systems used in

end-to

-end enterprise
mobility solutions. Symbol will become the cornerstone of the
segment’s enterprise mobility strategy. In 2006, the
segment’s net sales represented 26% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales, compared to 32% in 2005 and 35% in 2004.

Segment Results—2006 Compared to 2005

The segment’s net sales were $11.2 billion in both
2006 and 2005. The slight increase in net sales was primarily
driven by higher net sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa
region (“EMEA”) and Latin America, partially offset by
lower net sales in North America and Asia. In the private
networks market, net sales were up in all regions, driven by
increased demand for enhanced mission-critical communications
systems. Net sales to the public networks market decreased,
primarily due to decreases in: (i) Asia, due in part to
delays in the granting of 3G licenses in China that have led
service providers to slow their near-term capital investment and
competitive pricing, (ii) North America, primarily due to
customer expenditures returning to historic trends compared to
an exceptionally strong 2005, and (iii) Latin America,
partially offset by a slight increase in net sales in EMEA.

The segment’s operating earnings were $1.5 billion in
2006, compared to operating earnings of $1.9 billion in
2005. The 22% decrease in operating earnings was primarily due
to: (i) a decrease in gross margin, due to an unfavorable
product/regional mix and competitive pricing in the public
networks market, and (ii) an increase in reorganization of
business charges, primarily related to employee severance. As a
percentage of net sales, both R&D expenditures and SG&A
expenses were flat compared to 2005.

Net sales into U.S. markets represented approximately 51%
of the segment’s total net sales in 2006, compared to
approximately 52% in 2005. Due to the nature of the
segment’s business, many of the agreements we enter into
are long-term contracts that require sizeable investments by our
customers. Net sales to the segment’s top
five commercial customers, plus the U.S. government
and its public safety agencies, represented approximately 34% of
the segment’s net sales in 2006. The loss of one of these
major customers could have a significant impact on the
segment’s business and, because many of these contracts are
long-term in nature, could impact revenue and earnings over
several quarters. The segment’s backlog was
$4.4 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to
$4.1 billion at December 31, 2005.

In the private networks business, natural disasters and
terrorist-related worldwide events in 2005 continued to place an
emphasis on mission-critical communications systems. Spending by
the segment’s private networks market customers is affected
by government budgets at the national, state and local levels.

In the public networks business, Sprint Nextel selected the
segment to play a major role in the Sprint Nextel WiMAX
infrastructure roll-out. The segment has been a long-standing
proponent of WiMAX and is now participating in 22 WiMAX trials
globally. The segment also maintained momentum in infrastructure
development and services in 2006 by continuing to deliver
outstanding technologies and services for wireless and wireline
carriers. The segment has 55 commercial deployments of
push-to-talk over cellular (“PoC”) technology with
customers operating in 39 countries through 2006.

Sprint Nextel is the segment’s largest customer and the
segment has been Sprint Nextel’s sole supplier of iDEN
network infrastructure equipment for more than ten years. Sprint
Nextel uses Motorola’s proprietary iDEN technology to
support its nationwide wireless service business. Motorola is
currently operating under a supply agreement for iDEN
infrastructure equipment that covers the period from
January 1, 2005 through December 31,



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2007. The segment’s sales of iDEN network infrastructure
equipment decreased from 2005 to 2006 and is expected to
continue to decline in 2007.

During 2006, the segment completed a number of significant
acquisitions, including: (i) Orthogon Systems LLC, a leader
in wireless Ethernet connectivity and orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (“OFDM”) technology for fixed
wireless equipment, and (ii) NextNet Wireless, Inc., a
former Clearwire Corporation subsidiary and a leading provider
of OFDM-based
non

-line-of

-sight
(“NLOS”) wireless broadband infrastructure equipment.

The acquisition of Symbol is an important step forward for our
enterprise mobility strategy. Consistent with the segment’s
focus on extending our seamless mobility leadership, the
acquisition unites the adjacent assets, expertise, customer
bases, supplier bases and industry-leading products to enhance
the segment’s leading position in the enterprise mobility
market.

Segment Results—2005 Compared to 2004

In 2005, the segment’s net sales increased 7% to
$11.2 billion, compared to $10.5 billion in 2004. The
increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher net sales
in North America and EMEA, partially offset by lower net sales
in Asia and Latin America. In 2005 compared to 2004, net sales
to the private networks market were up in all regions, driven by
increased demand for enhanced mission-critical communications
systems and the continued focus on homeland security
initiatives. Net sales to the public networks market:
(i) increased in EMEA and North America, primarily due to
increased demand for cellular infrastructure equipment and
related services, and (ii) decreased in Asia, due in part
to delays in the granting of 3G licenses in China that have led
service providers to slow their near-term capital investment,
and in Latin America.

The segment’s operating earnings increased to
$1.9 billion in 2005, compared to operating earnings of
$1.6 billion in 2004. The 25% increase in operating
earnings was primarily due to: (i) an increase in gross
margin, driven by the 7% increase in net sales, and
(ii) improvements in cost structure for the public networks
market. This improvement in operating results was partially
offset by: (i) an increase in SG&A expenses, primarily
due to increased selling and sales support expenses associated
with the increase in net sales, and (ii) an increase in
R&D expenditures, driven by increased investment in
next-generation technologies across the segment. As a percentage
of net sales in 2005 compared to 2004, R&D expenditures
decreased and SG&A expenses increased.

Net sales into U.S. markets represented approximately 52%
of the segment’s total net sales in 2005, compared to
approximately 50% in 2004. Net sales to the segment’s top
five commercial customers, plus the U.S. government
and its public safety agencies, represented approximately 37% of
the segment’s net sales in 2005. The loss of one of these
major customers could have a significant impact on the
segment’s business and, because many of these contracts are
long-term in nature, could impact revenue and earnings over
several quarters. The segment’s backlog was
$4.1 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to
$4.2 billion at December 31, 2004.

On August 12, 2005, Sprint Corporation and Nextel
Communications, Inc. completed their merger transaction (the
“Sprint Nextel Merger”) that was announced in December
2004. In 2005, the combined company, Sprint Nextel, was the
segment’s largest customer, representing 14% of the
segment’s net sales. The segment did not experience any
significant impact to its business in 2005 as a result of the
Sprint Nextel Merger.

In 2005, the segment continued to build on its industry-leading
position in

push-to

-talk over
cellular (“PoC”) technology, executing agreements to
launch our PoC product application on both GSM and
CDMA2000 networks. The segment had 44 commercial
deployments of PoC technology with customers operating in
33 countries and territories through 2005. In addition, the
segment signed a contract with Earthlink to deliver equipment
and services enabling them to become a Metro WiFi broadband
provider in Philadelphia, Anaheim and other cities.

(including modems). The segment’s net sales represented 8%
of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2006, 2005 and
2004.

Segment Results—2006 Compared to 2005

In 2006, the segment’s net sales increased 16% to
$3.3 billion, compared to $2.9 billion in 2005. The
increase in net sales was primarily driven by increased demand
for digital entertainment devices, particularly advanced HD/DVR
set-top boxes. Net sales increased in all regions. Net sales in
North America continue to comprise a significant portion of the
segment’s business, accounting for 83% of the
segment’s total net sales in 2006, compared to 85% in 2005.
The segment’s backlog was $792 million at
December 31, 2006, compared to $430 million at
December 31, 2005. The 84% increase in backlog is primarily
due to strong orders for our digital and HD/DVR set-top boxes.

The segment had operating earnings of $224 million in 2006,
compared to operating earnings of $153 million in 2005. The
46% increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the
increase in gross margin, driven by the 16% increase in net
sales, partially offset by: (i) an increase in Other
charges (income) from a legal reserve and an increase in net
reorganization of business charges, primarily relating to
employee severance, and (ii) an increase in R&D
expenditures, primarily related to developmental engineering
expenditures. SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures as a
percentage of net sales both decreased as compared to 2005.

In 2006, net sales of digital entertainment devices increased
24% compared to 2005. Unit shipments of digital entertainment
devices increased to 10.1 million, a 57% increase from
2005, while ASPs decreased due to a product mix shift. The
increase in unit shipments of digital entertainment devices was
primarily due to increased demand for HD/DVR set-top boxes. The
segment continued to be the worldwide leader in market share for
digital entertainment devices.

In 2006, net sales of cable modems increased 18% compared to
2005. The increase in net sales of cable modems was due to:
(i) increased unit shipments of cable modems, and
(ii) increased ASPs for cable modems, reflecting increased
demand for advanced voice-enabled modems. The segment retained
its leading worldwide market share in cable modems.

Demand for the segment’s products depends primarily on the
level of capital spending by broadband operators for
constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their communications
systems, and for offering advanced services. In 2006, our cable
operator customers significantly increased their purchases of
the segment’s products and services, primarily due to
increased demand for digital entertainment devices, particularly
HD/DVR set-top boxes.

The segment is dependent upon a small number of customers for a
significant portion of its sales. A small number of large cable
television multiple system operators (“MSOs”) own a
large portion of the cable systems and account for a significant
portion of the total capital spending in the cable industry. In
2006, net sales to the segment’s top five customers
represented 54% of the segment’s total net sales, and net
sales to the segment’s largest customer, Comcast
Corporation (“Comcast”), accounted for 29% of the
segment’s total net sales. The loss of business from any
major MSO could have a significant impact on the segment’s
business.

During 2006, the segment completed a number of significant
acquisitions, including: (i) Kreatel Communications AB, a
leading developer of innovative

IP-based

digital
set-top boxes and software, (ii) Broadbus Technologies,
Inc., a provider of technology solutions for television on
demand, and (iii) Vertasent LLC, a software developer for
managing technology elements for switched digital video
networks. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on
the segment results in 2006. In February 2007, the segment
completed the acquisition of Netopia, Inc., a broadband
equipment provider for DSL customers, which allows for phone, TV
and fast Internet connections. The segment also announced its
intention to acquire Tut Systems, Inc., a leading developer of
edge routing and video encoders.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Segment Results—2005 Compared to 2004

In 2005, the segment’s net sales increased 23% to
$2.9 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in 2004. The
increase in overall net sales was driven by increases in both
ASP and unit shipments of digital entertainment devices,
particularly HD/DVR set-top boxes. Net sales increased in North
America, Latin America and Asia, partially offset by a slight
decrease in net sales in EMEA. Net sales in North America
accounted for 85% of the segment’s total net sales in 2005,
compared to 83% in 2004. The segment’s backlog was
$430 million at December 31, 2005, compared to
$305 million at December 31, 2004.

The segment generated operating earnings of $153 million in
2005, compared to $154 million in 2004. The slight decrease
in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase in
R&D expenditures, primarily related to developmental
engineering expenditures, partially offset by an increase in
gross margin, driven by the 23% increase in net sales. In 2005,
compared to 2004, gross margin as a percentage of net sales
decreased primarily due to increased product costs due to
increased sales of digital entertainment devices, mainly HD/DVR
set-top boxes, partially offset by higher ASPs on HD/DVR set-top
boxes. As a percentage of net sales, for 2005 compared to 2004,
SG&A expenses decreased and R&D expenditures increased.

In 2005, net sales of digital entertainment devices increased
34%, due to increases in both ASP and unit shipments. The
increase in ASP was driven by a product-mix shift towards
higher-end products, particularly HD/DVR set-top boxes. The
increase in unit shipments was primarily due to the increased
spending by cable operators. The segment continued to be the
worldwide leader in market share for digital cable set-top boxes.

In 2005, net sales of cable modems increased 33%. The increase
in net sales was due to an increase in cable modem unit
shipments, which was partially offset by the decline in ASP for
cable modems. The decrease in ASP was primarily due to increased
competition. The segment retained its leading worldwide market
share in cable modems.

Demand for the segment’s products depends primarily on the
level of capital spending by broadband operators for
constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their communications
systems and services. After a number of years of decreased
capital spending, in 2005 and 2004 our cable operator customers
increased their purchases of the segment’s products and
services, primarily due to increased demand for advanced digital
set-top boxes to provide HD/DVR functionality.

In 2005, net sales to the segment’s top five customers
represented 53% of the segment’s total net sales and net
sales to the segment’s largest customer, Comcast, accounted
for 31% of the segment’s total net sales. The loss of
business from any major MSO could have a significant impact on
the segment’s business.

Significant Accounting Policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations discuss the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current economic and industry conditions and on
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following significant accounting
policies require significant judgment and estimates:

— Revenue recognition

— Allowance for losses on finance receivables

— Inventory valuation reserves

— Taxes on income

— Valuation of investments and long-lived assets



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

— Restructuring activities

— Retirement-related benefits

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s arrangements with customers may differ in
nature and complexity and may contain multiple deliverables,
including products, equipment, services and software that may be
essential to the functionality of the other deliverables, which
requires the Company to make judgments and estimates in
recognizing revenues.

Product and equipment sales may contain discounts, price
protection, return provisions and other customer incentives. The
Company’s recorded revenues are reduced by allowances for
these items at the time the sales are recorded. The allowances
are based on management’s best estimate of the amount of
allowances that the customer will ultimately earn and is based
on historical experience taking into account the type of
products sold, the type of customer and the type of transaction
specific to each arrangement.

The Company’s long-term contracts may involve the design,
engineering, manufacturing and installation of wireless networks
and two-way radio voice and data systems. These systems are
designed to meet specific customer requirements and
specifications and generally require extended periods to
complete. If the Company can reliably estimate revenues and
contract costs and the technology is considered proven, revenue
is recognized under the percentage of completion method as work
progresses towards completion; otherwise, the revenue is
recognized under the completed contract method. Estimates of
contract revenues, contract costs and progress towards
completion are based on estimates that consider historical
experience and other factors believed to be relevant under the
circumstances. Management regularly reviews these estimates and
considers the impact of recurring business risks and
uncertainties inherent in the contracts, such as system
performance and implementation delays due to factors within or
outside the control of management.

Generally, multiple element arrangements are separated into
specific accounting units when delivered elements have value to
the customer on a stand-alone basis, objective and reliable
evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element(s),
and delivery of the undelivered element(s) is probable and
substantially within the control of the Company. Total
arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate
accounting units based on their relative fair values (if the
fair value of each accounting unit is known) or using the
residual method (if the fair value of the undelivered element(s)
is known). Revenue is recognized for a separate accounting unit
when the revenue recognition criteria are met for that unit. In
certain situations, judgment is required in determining both the
number of accounting units and fair value of the elements,
although generally the fair value of an element can be
objectively determined if the Company sells the element on a
stand-alone basis.

Changes in these estimates could negatively impact the
Company’s operating results. In addition, unforeseen
conditions could arise over the contract term that may have a
significant impact on the operating results. It is reasonably
likely that different operating results would be reported if the
Company used other acceptable revenue recognition methodologies,
such as the completed-contract method, or applied different
assumptions.

Allowance for Losses on Finance Receivables

The Company has historically provided financing to certain
customers in connection with purchases of the Company’s
infrastructure equipment where the contractual terms of the note
agreements are greater than one year. Financing provided has
included all or a portion of the equipment purchase price.

Gross financing receivables were $279 million and
$272 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively with an allowance for losses on these receivables
of $10 million and $12 million, respectively. Of the
receivables at December 31, 2006, $1 million ($0, net
of allowances for losses of $1 million) were considered
impaired based on management’s determination that the
Company will be unable to collect all amounts in accordance with
the contractual terms of the relevant agreement. By comparison,
impaired receivables at December 31, 2005 were
$10 million ($0, net of allowance for losses of
$10 million).

Management periodically reviews customer account activity in
order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for
potential losses. Factors considered include economic
conditions, collateral values and each customer’s payment
history and credit worthiness. Adjustments, if any, are made to
reserve balances following the completion of these reviews to
reflect management’s best estimate of potential losses. The
resulting net finance receivable balance is intended to
represent the estimated realizable value as determined based on:
(i) the fair value of the



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

underlying collateral, if the receivable is collateralized, or
(ii) the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the
underlying receivable.

Inventory Valuation Reserves

The Company records valuation reserves on its inventory for
estimated obsolescence or un-marketability. The amount of the
reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the
inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis,
management in each segment performs an analysis of the
underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and
obsolescence and, for the remaining inventory, assesses the net
realizable value. Management uses its best judgment to estimate
appropriate reserves based on this analysis.

Inventories consisted of the following:

3,578

Less inventory reserves

(529

$

3,162

$

2,422

The Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory
levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its
customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to
rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As
indicated above, the Company’s inventory reserves
represented 12% and 18% of the gross inventory balance at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company has
inventory reserves for pending cancellations of product lines
due to technology changes, long-life cycle products, lifetime
buys at the end of supplier production runs, business exits, and
a shift of production to outsourcing.

If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory
writedowns may be required. Likewise, as with other reserves
based on management’s judgment, if the reserve is no longer
needed, amounts are reversed into income. There were no
significant reversals into income of this type in 2006 or 2005.

Taxes on Income

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income
and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated
effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company’s
quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a
significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to
be recognized, in the Company’s quarterly operating
results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately
calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or
discrete item. The Company considers the resolution of prior
year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is
required in determining the Company’s effective tax rate
and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes
reserves when it is probable that the Company will not realize
the full tax benefit of the position. The Company adjusts these
reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.

Tax regulations may require items of income and expense to be
included in the tax return in different periods than the items
are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a
result, the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated
financial statements may be different than the tax rate reported
in the income tax return. Some of these differences are
permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax
return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation
expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that
can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in
future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax
benefit in the consolidated financial statements. The Company
establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets
when it is more likely than not that the amount of expected
future taxable income will not support the use of the deduction
or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax
expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for
which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company
has already taken a deduction on the income tax return, but has
not yet recognized as expense in the consolidated financial
statements.

Valuation of Investments and Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of investments and
long-lived assets, which includes identifiable intangible
assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that
could trigger an impairment review include:
(i) underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results, (ii) changes in the
manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall
business, (iii) negative industry or economic trends,
(iv) declines in stock price of an investment for a
sustained period, and (v) our market capitalization
relative to net book value.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
intangible assets, goodwill and long-lived assets may not be
recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded. Impairment is
generally measured based on a projected discounted cash flow
method using a discount rate determined by our management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
model or prevailing market rates of investment securities, if
available.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net book values of these
assets were as follows (in millions):

December 31



Property, plant and equipment

$

2,267

$

2,020

Investments


1,644

Intangible assets



Goodwill

1,706

1,349

$

5,222

$

5,244

The Company recorded fixed asset impairment charges of
$15 million in both 2006 and 2005, compared to no charges
in 2004.

The Company recorded impairment charges related to its
investment portfolio of $27 million, $25 million and
$36 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
representing other-than-temporary declines in the value of the
Company’s investment portfolio, primarily related to
cost-based investment write-downs. Additionally, the
available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected a net pre-tax
unrealized gain position of $60 million and
$157 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

The Company performs a goodwill impairment test at the reporting
unit level at least annually on October 1, or more often
should triggering events occur. In determining the fair value of
the reporting unit, the Company utilizes independent appraisal
firms who employ a combination of present value techniques and
quoted market prices of comparable businesses. No impairment
charges were required in 2006 or 2005. During 2004, the Company
determined that goodwill related to a sensor business, which was
subsequently divested in 2005, was impaired by $125 million.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of future
impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might
have on these reported asset values. Such events may include
strategic decisions made in response to the economic conditions
relative to product lines or operations and the impact of the
economic environment on our customer base.

Restructuring Activities

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
“Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
and employment grade level in the event that employment is
involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in

-force or
restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in

-force has
qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and,
therefore, such benefits are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits” (“SFAS 112”). Under the provisions
of SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefits
based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time
that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably
estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a
restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs
primarily consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated
facilities. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its
accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure
the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances,
accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in
carrying out the plans or because employees previously
identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not
receive severance or were



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original
plans were initiated. The Company reverses accruals through the
income statement line item where the original charges were
recorded when it is determined they are no longer required.

Retirement-Related Benefits

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
“Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. On
February 20, 2007, the Company passed an amendment to the
Regular Pension Plan which changes the definition of average
earnings. Under the current formula, benefits are calculated
using the highest annual earnings in any five years within the
last ten calendar years. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit
will be based on the average of the five highest years of
earnings within the last ten calendar years prior to
December 31, 2007 averaged with future earnings. The
Company also provides defined benefit plans to some of its
foreign entities (the

“Non-U.S.

Plans”).

The Company also has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
elected officers. The Officers’ Plan contains provisions
for funding the participants’ expected retirement benefits
when the participants meet the minimum age and years of service
requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the
Officers’ Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option
to remain in the Officers’ Plan or elect to have their
benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective
December 31, 1999, no new elected officers were eligible to
participate in the Officers’ Plan. Effective June 30,
2005, the salaries to be utilized for calculation of benefits
under this plan have been frozen.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
(“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits in
excess of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code
on the Regular Pension Plan. Elected officers covered under the
Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective
January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees are not eligible to
participate in the MSPP. Effective January 1, 2007,
eligible compensation for calculation of benefits under MSPP has
been capped at the IRS limit plus $175,000 or, for those in
excess of this cap at January 1, 2007, their current
compensation is frozen for calculation purposes.

Certain healthcare benefits are available to eligible domestic
employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
termination of employment (the “Postretirement Health Care
Benefits Plan”). For eligible employees hired prior to
January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefits
Plan has been closed to new participants.

Accounting methodologies use an attribution approach that
generally spreads individual events over the service lives of
the employees in the plan. Examples of “events” are
plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as
discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,
and rate of compensation increases. The principle underlying the
required attribution approach is that employees render service
over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and,
therefore, the income statement effects of pension benefits or
postretirement health care benefits are earned in, and should be
expensed in, the same pattern.

There are various assumptions used in calculating the net
periodic benefit expense and related benefit obligations. One of
these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets. The required use of expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income
that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan
assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected
long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual
long-term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income
and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of
the services provided by the employees. Differences between
actual and expected returns are recognized in the net periodic
pension calculation over five years.

The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience
with consideration of the expected investment mix of the
plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term
investment returns to develop its expected rate of return
assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost and
the net retirement healthcare expense. The Company’s
investment return assumption for the Regular Pension Plan and
Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan was 8.5% in 2006 and
2005. The investment return assumption for the Officers’
Plan was 6% in 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, the
Regular Pension Plan and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits
Plan

investment portfolio were predominantly equity investments and
the Officers’ Plan investment portfolio was predominantly
fixed-income securities.



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate
assumptions used for pension benefits and postretirement health
care benefits accounting reflects, at December 31 of each
year, the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income
debt instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the
measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows
to pay the benefit obligation when due. The Company’s
discount rate for measuring the pension obligations was 6% at
December 2006 and 2005. The Company’s discount rate for
measuring the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan
obligation was 5.75% at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

A final set of assumptions involves the cost drivers of the
underlying benefits. The rate of compensation increase is a key
assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting
and is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans
for such increases. In both 2006 and 2005, the Company’s
rate for future compensation increase was 4% for the Regular
Pension Plan. The Company’s 2006 and 2005 rate for future
compensation increase for the Officers’ Plan was 0% as the
salaries to be utilized for calculation of benefits under this
plan have been frozen. For Postretirement Health Care Benefits
Plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own
historical trends for health care costs to determine the health
care cost trend rates. Based on this review, the health care
cost trend rate used to determine the December 31, 2006
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 10% for 2006
with a declining trend rate of 1% each year until it reaches 5%
by 2011, with a flat 5% rate for 2011 and beyond. Changes in the
industry’s projected health care costs have caused the
graded trend rate assumption to be reset to 10% for 2007, with
the trend rate expected to grade down 1% per year until
reaching 5% by 2012.

The actuarial assumptions for all plans are set forth at the
beginning of the fiscal year. Variations from these assumptions
typically are amortized into expense over the average service
period. Beginning in 2006, unamortized amounts are held as a
separate, non-owner component of equity. The Company recorded a
non-cash, after-tax, net charge of $308 million to equity
relating to the unamortized amounts for the Regular Pension
Plan, the Officers’ Plan,

Non-U.S.

Plans,
and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in the fourth
quarter of 2006.

For the Regular Pension Plan, the Company currently estimates
2007 expenses for continuing operations will be approximately
$170 million. The 2006 and 2005 actual expenses were
$240 million and $177 million, respectively. Cash
contributions of $270 million were made to the Regular
Pension Plan in 2006. The Company expects to make cash
contributions of approximately $280 million to its U.S.
pension plans and approximately $120 million to its

non-U.S.

pension
plans during 2007.

For the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan, the Company
currently estimates 2007 expenses for continuing operations will
be approximately $21 million. The 2006 and 2005 actual
expenses were $22 million and $27 million,
respectively. Motorola is obligated to transfer to Freescale
Semiconductor $68 million, plus investment returns earned
on this amount, which was approximately $17 million as of
December 31, 2006 in cash or plan assets, as permitted by
law without adverse tax consequences to Motorola, with such
transfer expected to occur in 2007. Cash contributions of
$27 million were made to this plan in 2006. The Company
expects to make cash contributions of approximately
$24 million to the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan
in 2007.

The impact on the future financial results of the Company in
relation to retirement-related benefits is dependent on economic
conditions, employee demographics, interest rates and investment
performance. The Company’s measurement date of its plan
assets and obligations is December 31. Thus, during the
fourth quarter of each year, management reviews and, if
necessary, adjusts the assumptions associated with its benefit
plans.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (“SFAS”) No. 159, “The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments
and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and
losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected
will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting
date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing
the impact of SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial
statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued EITF 06-4,
“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
Arrangements”
(“EITF

06-4”).

EITF

06-4

requires
that endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements which
provide a benefit to an employee beyond the postretirement
period be recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
“Employer’s Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions” or APB Opinion No. 12,
“Omnibus Opinion — 1967” based on the
substance of



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

the agreement with the employee. Under the provisions of these
Statements, a liability should be accrued equal to the actuarial
present value of the future death benefits over the service
period. EITF

06-4

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2007. The effects of applying
EITF

06-4

may be
reflected as either a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or through
retrospective application to all prior periods. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of
EITF

06-4

on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”).
SFAS 158 requires employers to (i) recognize the
funded status of their defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans on their consolidated balance sheet,
(ii) recognize as a component of other comprehensive
income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs
or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized
as components of net periodic benefit cost, (iii) measure
defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of
the employer’s statement of financial position, and
(iv) disclose additional information in the notes to
financial statements. The Company adopted the recognition and
disclosure requirements of SFAS 158 as of December 31,
2006. The impact of adopting these provisions was an increase in
net liabilities for pension and postretirement health care
benefits of $783 million and a decrease in
stockholders’ equity of $514 million, net of taxes.
The SFAS 158 provision related to measurement date is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the change in
measurement date on the Company’s financial statements but
does not believe the adoption of this provision of SFAS 158
will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value as required by other accounting
pronouncements and expands fair value measurement disclosures.
SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of SFAS 157 on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”),
“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements.” SAB 108 expresses
the SEC Staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying
financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 addresses the
diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement
misstatements and the potential under current practice for the
build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The Company
adopted the provisions of SAB 108 as of December 31,
2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This
interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance
sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning
January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or cash flows. The Company
estimates that the adoption of FIN 48 will cause an
increase in noncurrent liabilities and an equal offsetting
increase in noncurrent deferred tax assets in the range of
$900 million to $1.0 billion. The amount of cash
ultimately payable with regard to the uncertain tax positions is
not affected by the balance sheet reclassification estimated
upon the adoption of FIN 48 and will be a function of
Motorola’s overall tax situation when the underlying tax
issues are resolved, taking into account the availability of
deferred tax assets that may reduce tax otherwise due.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
“Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets —
An Amendment of SFAS No. 140”
(“SFAS 156”). Among other requirements,
SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset
or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to
service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract
when there is either: (i) a transfer of the servicer’s
financial assets that meets the requirements for sale
accounting, (ii) a transfer of the servicer’s
financial assets to a qualifying special-purpose entity in a
guaranteed mortgage securitization in which the transferor
retains all of the resulting securities and classifies them as
either available-for-sale securities or trading securities in
accordance with SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, or
(iii) an acquisition or assumption of an obligation to
service a financial asset that does not relate to financial
assets of the servicer or its consolidated affiliates.
SFAS 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
September 15, 2006. The Company does not believe the
adoption of



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SFAS 156 will have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

Realignment of Segments

Effective as of the second quarter of 2006, the Company
realigned its businesses into three operating business segments:
(i) Mobile Devices, (ii) Networks and Enterprise, and
(iii) Connected Home Solutions. In addition, during the
second quarter of 2006, the Company executed an agreement to
sell its automotive electronics business. Reclassifications have
been made to prior years’ financial statements and related
notes to conform to the 2006 presentation and present the
automotive electronics business as a discontinued operation.

Reclassifications

Effective as of the fourth quarter 2006, the Company reflects
costs associated with the amortization of intangible assets and
in-process research and development at the corporate level
rather than at the business segment level. Accordingly, these
costs have been reclassified in prior period financial
statements from the corresponding business segment to Other and
Eliminations to conform to the current period presentation. In
addition, certain costs associated with amortization of
intangible assets, information technology development and new
product introduction costs have been reclassified between
statement lines in the consolidated statements of operations in
the prior period financial statements to conform to the current
period presentation.

“Item 1A: Risk Factors.” We wish to caution the
reader that the risk factors discussed in “Item 1A:
Risk Factors”, and those described elsewhere in this report
or our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, could

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Foreign Currency Risk

As a multinational company, the Company’s transactions are
denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses
financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the
effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. The
Company’s policy prohibits speculation in financial
instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
trading in currencies for which there are no underlying
exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to
intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be
effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
being hedged and are designated as a part of a hedging
relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of
the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments
against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
or investments based on the operating business units’
assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts
for some of the Company’s non-functional currency
receivables and payables, which are primarily denominated in
major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company
uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency
exposures. In addition, the Company enters into derivative
contracts for some firm commitments and some forecasted
transactions, which are designated as part of a hedging
relationship if it is determined that the transaction qualifies
for hedge accounting under the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” A portion of the Company’s exposure is
from currencies that are not traded in liquid markets and these
are addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, through
managing net asset positions, product pricing and component
sourcing.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had net
outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
$4.8 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not
subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities
and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the
instruments, which are charged to Other within Other income
(expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations. The following table shows, in millions of
U.S. dollars, the five largest net foreign exchange
contract positions as of December 31, 2006 and, 2005:

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
obligations. However, the Company does not expect any
counterparties, all of whom presently have investment grade
credit ratings, to fail to meet their obligations.

Foreign exchange financial instruments that are subject to the
effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect reported
earnings, include derivative financial instruments and other
financial instruments which are not denominated in the
functional currency of the legal entity holding the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments consist primarily of forward
contracts and currency options. Other financial instruments,
which are not denominated in the functional currency of the
legal entity holding the instrument, consist primarily of cash,
cash equivalents, Sigma Funds and short-term investments, as
well as accounts payable and receivable. Accounts payable and
receivable are reflected at fair value in the financial
statements. The fair value of the foreign exchange financial
instruments would hypothetically decrease by $312 million
as of December 31, 2006 if the foreign currency rates were
to change unfavorably by 10% of current levels. This
hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on future cash
flows under the following conditions: (i) all current
payables and receivables that are hedged were not realized,
(ii) all hedged commitments and anticipated transactions
were not realized or canceled, and (iii) hedges of these
amounts were not canceled or offset. The Company does not expect
that any of these conditions will be



realized. The Company expects that gains and losses on the
derivative financial instruments should offset gains and losses
on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged.
If the hedged transactions were included in the sensitivity
analysis, the hypothetical change in fair value would be
immaterial. The foreign exchange financial instruments are held
for purposes other than trading.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company recorded income of $0.6 million,
$1.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of fair value hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include
the change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to
the changes in the difference between the spot price and the
forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of
effectiveness. Expense (income) related to fair value hedges
that were discontinued for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 are included in the amounts noted above.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company recorded income (expense) of $13 million,
$1 million and $(12) million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include
the change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to
the changes in the difference between the spot price and the
forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of
effectiveness. Expense (income) related to cash flow hedges that
were discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 are included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, on
a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $(98) million,
$21 million and $(27) million, respectively, was
reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. If exchange rates do not
change from year-end, the Company estimates that
$16 million of pre-tax net derivative income included in
Non-owner changes to equity within Stockholders’ equity
would be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve
months and will be reclassified in the same period that the
hedged item affects earnings. The actual amounts that will be
reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months will vary
from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions.

At December 31, 2006, the maximum term of derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was two years.
However, the weighted average duration of the Company’s
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
seven months.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have any
hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
foreign operations.

Investments Hedge

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into a
zero-cost collar derivative (the “Sprint Nextel
Derivative”) to protect itself economically against price
fluctuations in its 37.6 million shares of Sprint Nextel
Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) non-voting common stock.
During the second quarter of 2006, as a result of Sprint
Nextel’s spin-off of Embarq Corporation through a dividend
to Sprint Nextel shareholders, the Company received
approximately 1.9 million shares of Embarq Corporation. The
floor and ceiling prices of the Sprint Nextel Derivative were
adjusted accordingly. The Sprint Nextel Derivative was not
designated as a hedge under the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” Accordingly, to reflect the change in fair
value of the Sprint Nextel Derivative, the Company recorded a
net gain of $99 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006, included in Other income (expense) in
the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. In
December 2006, the Sprint Nextel Derivative was terminated and
settled in cash and the 37.6 million shares of Sprint
Nextel were converted to common shares and sold. The Company
received aggregate cash proceeds of approximately
$820 million from the settlement of the Sprint Nextel
Derivative and the



subsequent sale of the 37.6 million Sprint Nextel shares.
The Company recognized a loss of $126 million in connection
with the sale of the remaining shares of Sprint Nextel common
stock. As described above, the Company recorded a net gain of
$99 million in connection with the Sprint Nextel Derivative.

Prior to the merger of Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”)
and Nextel Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”), the
Company had entered into variable share forward purchase
agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) to hedge its
Nextel common stock. The Company did not designate the Variable
Forwards as a hedge of the Sprint Nextel shares received as a
result of the merger. Accordingly, the Company recorded
$51 million of gains for the year ended December 31,
2005 reflecting the change in value of the Variable Forwards.
The Variable Forwards were settled during the fourth quarter of
2005.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
equivalents, Sigma Funds, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt, foreign
currency contracts and other financing commitments.

Using available market information, the Company determined that
the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2006 was
$4.3 billion, compared to a carrying value of
$4.1 billion. Since considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term
debt is not necessarily indicative of the amount which could be
realized in a current market exchange.

The fair values of the other financial instruments were not
materially different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2006.

Equity Price Market Risk

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s available-for-sale
securities portfolio had an approximate fair market value of
$130 million which represented a cost basis of
$70 million and a net unrealized gain of $60 million.
The value of the available-for-sale securities would change by
$13 million as of year-end 2006 if the price of the stock
in each of the publicly-traded companies were to change by 10%.
These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s short-term debt
consisted primarily of $300 million of commercial paper,
priced at short-term interest rates. The Company has $4.1
billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of
long-term debt, which is primarily priced at long-term, fixed
interest rates.

In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
payments. The following table displays these outstanding
interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006:

The weighted average short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
payments on each of the above interest rate swaps was 7.29% for
the three months ended December 31, 2006. The fair value of
the above interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, was $(47) million and
$(50) million, respectively. The fair value of



the above interest rate swaps would hypothetically decrease by
$24 million (i.e., would decrease from $(47) million
to $(71) million) if LIBOR were to change unfavorably by
10% from current levels. Except as noted below, the Company had
no outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options
relating to debt instruments at December 31, 2006 or
December 31, 2005.

The Company designated the above interest rate swap agreements
as part of a fair value hedging relationship. As such, changes
in the fair value of the hedging instrument, as well as the
hedged debt are recognized in earnings, therefore adjusting the
carrying amount of the debt. Interest expense on the debt is
adjusted to include the payments made or received under such
hedge agreements. In the event the underlying debt instrument
matures or is redeemed or repurchased, the Company is likely to
terminate the corresponding interest rate swap contracts.

Additionally, effective December 31, 2006, one of the
Company’s European subsidiaries entered into interest rate
agreements (“Interest Agreements”) relating to a
Euro-denominated loan. The interest on the Euro-denominated loan
is floating based on

3-month

EURIBOR plus a
spread. The Interest Agreements change the characteristics of
interest rate payments from short-term EURIBOR based variable
payments to maximum fixed-rate payments. The Interest Agreements
are not accounted for as a part of a hedging relationship and
accordingly the changes in the fair value of the Interest
Agreements are included in Other income (expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The fair
value of the Interest Agreements at December 31, 2006 was
$1 million. The fair value of the Interest Agreements would
hypothetically decrease by $2 million (i.e., would decrease
from $1 million to $(1) million if EURIBOR rates were
to change unfavorably by 10% from current levels).

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
dealing with leading, creditworthy financial institutions having
long-term debt ratings of “A” or better and, does not
anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts are
distributed among several financial institutions, thus
minimizing credit risk concentration.

discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and all
majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. The Company’s investments in
non-controlled entities in which it has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are
accounted for by the equity method. The Company’s
investments in other entities are accounted for using the cost
method.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. In
addition to these general revenue recognition criteria, the
following specific revenue recognition policies are followed:

Products and Equipment

— For product and
equipment sales, delivery generally does not occur until the
products or equipment have been shipped, risk of loss has
transferred to the customer, and objective evidence exists that
customer acceptance provisions have been met. The Company
records revenue when allowances for discounts, price protection,
returns and customer incentives can be reliably estimated.
Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. The Company
bases its estimates on historical experience taking into
consideration the type of products sold, the type of customer,
and the type of transaction specific in each arrangement.

Long-Term Contracts

— For long-term contracts
that involve customization or modification of the Company’s
equipment or software, the Company generally recognizes revenue
using the percentage of completion method based on the
percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total
estimated costs to complete the contract. In certain instances,
when revenues or costs associated with long-term contracts
cannot be reliably estimated or the contract involves unproven
technologies or other inherent hazards, revenues and costs are
deferred until the project is complete and customer acceptance
is obtained.

Services

— Revenue for services is generally
recognized ratably over the contract term as services are
performed.

Software and Licenses

— Revenue from pre-paid
perpetual licenses is recognized at the inception of the
arrangement, presuming all other relevant revenue recognition
criteria are met. Revenue from non-perpetual licenses or term
licenses is recognized ratably over the period that the licensee
uses the license. Revenue from software maintenance, technical
support and unspecified upgrades is generally recognized over
the period that these services are delivered.

Multiple Element Arrangements

— Arrangements
with customers may include multiple deliverables, including any
combination of products, equipment, services and software. If
multiple element arrangements include software or software
related elements, the Company applies the provisions of AICPA
Statement of
Position No.

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” to determine separate
units of accounting and the amount of the arrangement fee to be
allocated to those separate units of accounting. Multiple
element arrangements that include software are separated into
more than one unit of accounting if the functionality of the
delivered element(s) is not dependent on the undelivered
element(s), there is vendor-specific objective evidence of the
fair value of the undelivered element(s), and general revenue
recognition criteria related to the delivered element(s) have
been met. For all other deliverables, elements are separated
into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered
element(s) have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis,
objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the
undelivered element(s), and delivery of the undelivered
element(s) is probable and substantially in the control of the
Company. Revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based
on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the
residual method if objective evidence of fair value does not
exist for the delivered element(s). The revenue recognition
criteria described above are applied to each separate unit of
accounting. If these criteria are not met, revenue is deferred
until the criteria are met or the last element has been
delivered.

Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all highly-liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.



Sigma Funds:

The Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries invest most of their excess cash in two Sigma
Reserve funds (the “Sigma Funds”), which are funds
similar to a money market fund. The Sigma Funds portfolios are
managed by five major outside investment management firms and
include investments in high quality (rated at least A/ A-1 by
S&P or A2/ P-1 by Moody’s at purchase date),
U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations including
certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances and fixed
time deposits, government obligations, asset-backed securities
and commercial paper or short-term corporate obligations. The
Sigma Funds investment policies require that floating rate
instruments acquired must have a maturity at purchase date that
does not exceed thirty-six months with an interest rate reset at
least annually. The average maturity of the investments held by
the funds must be 120 days or less with the actual average
maturity of the investments being 53 days and 74 days
at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
values investments in the Sigma Funds using the amortized cost
method, which approximates current market value. Under this
method, securities are valued at cost when purchased and
thereafter a constant proportionate amortization of any discount
or premium is recorded until maturity of the security. Certain
investments with maturities beyond one year have been classified
as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because
such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that
is available for current operations.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of
average cost (which approximates computation on a

first-in,

first-out
basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is recorded using straight-line and
declining-balance methods, based on the estimated useful lives
of the assets (buildings and building equipment,
5-40 years; machinery and equipment, 2-12 years) and
commences once the assets are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill is not
amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least
annually on October 1. Intangible assets are amortized over
their respective estimated useful lives ranging from
18 months to 13 years. The Company has no intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

Long-lived assets held
and used by the Company and intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The
Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used
by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net
undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
calculated using a discounted future cash flows analysis. Assets
held for sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Investments:

Investments include, principally,
available-for-sale equity securities at fair value,

held-to

-maturity debt
securities at amortized cost, securities that are restricted for
more than one year or not publicly traded at cost, and equity
method investments. For the available-for-sale equity
securities, any unrealized holding gains and losses, net of
deferred taxes, are excluded from operating results and are
recognized as a separate component of Stockholders’ Equity
until realized. The fair values of the securities are determined
based on prevailing market prices. The Company assesses declines
in the value of individual investments to determine whether such
decline is other-than-temporary and thus the investment is
impaired. This assessment is made by considering available
evidence including changes in general market conditions,
specific industry and individual company data, the length of
time and the extent to which the market value has been less than
cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the
individual company, and the Company’s intent and ability to
hold the investment.

Deferred Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the
realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation
allowance is recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets
that are not expected to be realized based on the level of
historical taxable income, projections for future taxable income
over the periods in which the temporary differences are
deductible and allowable tax planning strategies.

Finance Receivables:

Finance receivables include trade
receivables where contractual terms of the note agreement are
greater than one year. Finance receivables are considered
impaired when management determines it is probable that the
Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
the contractual terms of the



note agreement, including principal and interest. Impaired
finance receivables are valued based on the present value of
expected future cash flows, discounted at the receivable’s
effective rate of interest, or the fair value of the collateral
if the receivable is collateral dependent. Interest income and
late fees on impaired finance receivables are recognized only
when payments are received. Previously impaired finance
receivables are no longer considered impaired and are
reclassified to performing when they have performed under a work
out or restructuring for four consecutive quarters.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments:

The fair values of
financial instruments are determined based on quoted market
prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting
period. The Company’s financial instruments include cash
and cash equivalents, Sigma Funds, short-term investments,
accounts receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts
payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt,
foreign currency contracts and other financing commitments. The
fair values of these financial instruments were, with the
exception of long-term debt as disclosed in Notes 4 and 5,
not materially different from their carrying or contract values
at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Foreign Currency:

Certain of the Company’s

non-U.S.

operations
use the respective local currency as the functional currency.
These operations that do not have the U.S. dollar as their
functional currency translate assets and liabilities at current
rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and
revenues and expenses using the monthly average exchange rates
in effect for the period in which the items occur. The resulting
translation adjustments are included as a component of
Stockholders’ equity in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets. For those operations that have the
U.S. dollar as their functional currency, transactions
denominated in the local currency are measured into
U.S. dollars using the current rates of exchange for
monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange
for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from remeasurement of
monetary assets and liabilities are included in Other income
(expense) within the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations.

Derivative Instruments:

Gains and losses on hedges of
existing assets, or liabilities are

marked-to

-market and
the result is included within Other income (expense) in the
consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on
financial instruments that hedge firm future commitments are
deferred until such time as the underlying transactions are
recognized or recorded immediately when the transaction is no
longer expected to occur. Gains or losses on financial
instruments that do not qualify as hedges under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“SFAS 133”) are recognized
immediately as income or expense.

Earnings Per Share:

The Company calculates its basic
earnings per share based on the weighted effect of all common
shares issued and outstanding. Net earnings is divided by the
weighted average common shares outstanding during the period to
arrive at the basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the sum of the
weighted average number of common shares used in the basic
earnings per share calculation and the weighted average number
of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or
conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, excluding
those securities that would be anti-dilutive to the earnings per
share calculation. Both basic and diluted earnings per share
amounts are calculated for earnings from continuing operations
and earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for all periods
presented.

Share-Based Compensation Costs:

The Company has incentive
plans which reward employees with stock options, an employee
stock purchase plan, and restricted stock. Prior to
January 1, 2006, the Company applied the intrinsic value
method of accounting for share-based compensation. On
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
(“SFAS 123R”). The amount of compensation cost
for share-based awards is measured based on the fair value, as
determined by the Black-Scholes option pricing model, on the
grant date that the share-based awards are issued and adjusted
for the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest.
Compensation cost for equity instruments is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Retirement Benefits:

The Company records annual expenses
relating to its pension benefit and postretirement plans based
on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions,
including discount rates, assumed asset rates of return,
compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost
trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an
annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on
current rates and trends. The effects of the gains, losses, and
prior service costs and credits are amortized over future
service periods. As of December 31, 2006, the funding
status, or projected benefit obligation less plan assets, for
each plan, is reflected in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial



statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts in prior years’
financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to
conform to the 2006 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In February 2007, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS 159”).
SFAS 159 permits entities to elect to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each
subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on its
consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
EITF

06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
Arrangements”
(“EITF

06-4”).

EITF

06-4

requires
that endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements which
provide a benefit to an employee beyond the postretirement
period be recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
“Employer’s Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions” or APB Opinion No. 12,
“Omnibus Opinion—1967” based on the substance of
the agreement with the employee. Under the provisions of these
Statements, a liability should be accrued equal to the actuarial
present value of the future death benefit over the service
period. EITF

06-4

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2007. The effects of applying
EITF

06-4

may be
reflected as either a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or through
retrospective application to all prior periods. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of
EITF

06-4

on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”).
SFAS 158 requires employers to (i) recognize the
funded status of their defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans on their consolidated balance sheet,
(ii) recognize as a component of other comprehensive
income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs
or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized
as components of net periodic benefit cost, (iii) measure
defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of
the employer’s statement of financial position, and
(iv) disclose additional information in the notes to
financial statements. The Company adopted the recognition and
disclosure requirements of SFAS 158 as of December 31,
2006. The impact of adopting these provisions was an increase in
net liabilities for pension and postretirement health care
benefits of $783 million and a decrease in
stockholders’ equity of $514 million, net of taxes.
The SFAS 158 provision related to measurement date is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the change in
measurement date on the Company’s financial statements but
does not believe the adoption of this provision of SFAS 158
will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value as required by other accounting
pronouncements and expands fair value measurement disclosures.
SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of SFAS 157 on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”),
“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements.” SAB 108 expresses
the SEC Staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying
financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 addresses the
diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement
misstatements and the potential under current practice for the
build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The Company
adopted the provisions of SAB 108 as of December 31,
2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This
interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance
sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and



transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning January 1,
2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flows. The Company estimates that the
adoption of FIN 48 will cause an increase in noncurrent
liabilities and an equal offsetting increase in noncurrent
deferred tax assets in the range of $900 million to
$1.0 billion. The amount of cash ultimately payable with
regard to the uncertain tax positions is not affected by the
balance sheet reclassification estimated upon the adoption of
FIN 48 and will be a function of Motorola’s overall
tax situation when the underlying tax issues are resolved,
taking into account the availability of deferred tax assets that
may reduce tax otherwise due.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
“Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets —
An Amendment of SFAS No. 140”
(“SFAS 156”). Among other requirements,
SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset
or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to
service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract
when there is either: (i) a transfer of the requirements
for sale accounting, (ii) a transfer of the servicer’s
financial assets to a qualifying special-purpose entity in a
guaranteed mortgage securitization in which the transferor
retains all of the resulting securities and classifies them as
either available-for-sale securities or trading securities in
accordance with SFAS  115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, or
(iii) an acquisition or assumption of an obligation to
service a financial asset that does not relate to financial
assets of the servicer or its consolidated affiliates.
SFAS 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
September 15, 2006. The Company does not believe the
adoption of SFAS 156 will have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.

2.

Discontinued Operations

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of its automotive
electronics business, which was a component of the Networks and
Enterprise segment, to Continental AG for $856 million in
net cash received. The Company recorded a gain on sale of
business of $399 million before income taxes, which is
included in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of
tax, in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company completed the
separation of its semiconductor operations into a separate
subsidiary, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale
Semiconductor”). Under the terms of the Master Separation
and Distribution Agreement entered into between Motorola and
Freescale Semiconductor, Freescale Semiconductor has agreed to
indemnify Motorola for substantially all past, present and
future liabilities associated with the semiconductor business.
In July 2004, an initial public offering (“IPO”) of a
minority interest of approximately 32.5% of Freescale
Semiconductor was completed. As a result of the IPO the Company
recorded additional paid-in capital of $397 million related
to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares
sold. Concurrently in July 2004, Freescale Semiconductor issued
senior debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of
$1.25 billion. On December 2, 2004, Motorola completed
the spin-off of its remaining 67.5% equity interest in Freescale
Semiconductor. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata
non-cash dividend to Motorola stockholders, which reduced
retained earnings by $2.5 billion. Holders of Motorola
stock at the close of business on November 26, 2004
received a dividend of .110415 shares of Freescale
Semiconductor Class B common stock per share of Motorola
common stock. No fractional shares of Freescale Semiconductor
were issued. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares of
Freescale Semiconductor Class B common stock in the
distribution received the cash value instead. The equity
distribution was structured to be tax-free to Motorola
stockholders for U.S. tax purposes (other than with respect
to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares).

The financial results of the automotive electronics business and
Freescale Semiconductor have been reflected as discontinued
operations in the accompanying financial statements and related
disclosures for all periods presented. As a result, the footnote
disclosures have been revised to exclude amounts related to the
automotive electronics business and Freescale Semiconductor.

The following table displays summarized financial information
for discontinued operations:

In 2006, the $41 million of net gains was primarily related
to a $141 million gain on the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Telus Corporation, partially offset by a
$126 million loss on the sale of the Company’s
remaining shares in Sprint Nextel Corporation (“Sprint
Nextel”).



During the first half of 2005, the Company sold
22.5 million shares of common stock of Nextel
Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”). The Company received
approximately $679 million in cash and realized a pre-tax
gain of $609 million from these sales.

On August 12, 2005, Sprint Corporation completed its merger
(the “Sprint Nextel Merger”) with Nextel. In
connection with the Sprint Nextel Merger, Motorola received
$46 million in cash, 31.7 million voting shares and
37.6 million non-voting shares of Sprint Nextel, in
exchange for its remaining 54.7 million shares of Nextel.
As a result of this transaction, the Company realized a gain of
$1.3 billion, comprised of a $1.7 billion gain
recognized on the receipt of cash and the 69.3 million
shares of Sprint Nextel in exchange for its shares of Nextel,
net of a $418 million loss recognized on its hedge of
25 million shares of common stock of Nextel.

On December 14, 2004, in connection with the announcement
of the definitive agreement relating to the Sprint Nextel
Merger, Motorola, a Motorola subsidiary and Nextel entered into
an agreement pursuant to which Motorola and its subsidiary
agreed to not dispose of their 29.7 million non-voting
shares of Nextel (now 37.6 million shares of

non-voting

common stock
of Sprint Nextel issued in exchange for Nextel

non-voting

common stock
pursuant to the Sprint Nextel Merger) for a period of no longer
than two years. In exchange for this agreement, Nextel paid
Motorola a fee of $50 million in 2005.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company elected to settle
variable share purchase agreements by delivering
30.3 million shares of Sprint Nextel common stock, with a
value of $725 million, to the counterparties and selling
the remaining 1.4 million Sprint Nextel common shares in
the open market. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of
$391 million and realized a loss of $70 million in
connection with the settlement and sale.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the $460 million
gain on sales of investments and businesses is primarily
comprised of: (i) a $130 million gain on the sale of
the Company’s remaining shares in Broadcom Corporation,
(ii) a $122 million gain on the sale of a portion of
the Company’s shares in Nextel, (iii) an
$82 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Telus Corporation, and (iv) a
$68 million gain on the sale of a portion of the
Company’s shares in Nextel Partners, Inc.

Share Repurchase Program

In May 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
purchase up to $4.0 billion of its outstanding shares of
common stock over a period of up to 36 months ending in May
2008, subject to market conditions (the “2005 Stock
Repurchase Program”). In July 2006, the Company entered
into an accelerated stock buyback agreement to repurchase
approximately $1.2 billion of its outstanding common stock
(the “ASB”). In October 2006, the Company received the
final distribution of shares under the ASB. The total shares
purchased under the ASB were 50.5 million shares. The ASB
completed the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program.

On July 24, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the
Company to repurchase up to an additional $4.5 billion of
its outstanding shares of common stock over a period of up to 36
months ending in June 2009, subject to market conditions (the
“2006 Stock Repurchase Program”). In the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company purchased $700 million of
shares under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program.

The Company repurchased a total of 171.7 million common
shares (including shares received under the ASB) at a cost of
$3.8 billion in 2006. The Company repurchased a total of
41.7 million common shares at a cost of $874 million
in 2005. All repurchased shares have been retired.



4. Debt and Credit Facilities

Long-Term Debt

Short-Term Debt

In January 2007, the Company repaid, at maturity, all
$118 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its
7.6% Notes due January 1, 2007 (the “2007
7.6% Notes”).

In November 2006, $1.2 billion of 4.608% Senior Notes
due November 16, 2007 were reclassified to current portion
of long-term debt.

In September 2005, the Company repurchased an aggregate
principal amount of $1.0 billion of its outstanding
long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of
$1.1 billion through cash tender offers. Included in the
$1.0 billion of long-term debt repurchased were repurchases
of a principal amount of: (i) $86 million of the
$200 million of 6.50% Notes due 2008 outstanding,
(ii) $241 million of the $325 million of
5.80% Notes due 2008 outstanding, and
(iii) $673 million of the $1.2 billion of
7.625% Notes due 2010 outstanding. In addition, the Company
terminated a notional amount of $1.0 billion of

fixed-to

-floating
interest rate swaps associated with the debt repurchased,
resulting in an expense of approximately $22 million. The
aggregate charge for the repurchase of the debt and the
termination of the associated interest rate swaps, as presented
in Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations, was $137 million.

On September 1, 2005, the Company retired approximately
$1 million of the $398 million of 6.5% Debentures
due 2025 (the “2025 Debentures”) in connection with
the holders of the debentures right to put their debentures back
to the Company. The residual put options expired unexercised and
the remaining $397 million of 2025 Debentures were
reclassified to long-term debt.



In 2004, the Company retired approximately $2.3 billion of
debt, including $1.8 billion of debt retired prior to
maturity. The net charge for the repurchase of the debt and the
termination of the associated interest rate swaps, as presented
in Other income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations, was $81 million.

Aggregate requirements for long-term debt maturities during the
next five years are as follows: 2007 —
$1.3 billion; 2008 — $198 million;
2009 — $4 million; 2010 —
$534 million; 2011 — $607 million.

In December 2006, the Company signed a new five-year revolving
domestic credit facility

(“5-Year

Credit
Facility”) for $2.0 billion, replacing the existing
facility totaling $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2006,
the commitment fee assessed against the daily average amounts
unused was 6.5 basis points. Important terms of the

5-Year

Credit Facility
include a covenant relating to the ratio of total debt to
EBITDA. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the

5-year

Credit Facility
at December 31, 2006. The Company’s current corporate
credit ratings are “A-” with a stable outlook by
Fitch, “Baa1” with a positive outlook by Moody’s,
and “A-” with a stable outlook by S&P. The Company
has never borrowed under its domestic revolving credit
facilities. The Company also has $2.0 billion of

non-U.S.

credit
facilities with interest rates on borrowings varying from
country to country depending upon local market conditions. At
December 31, 2006, the Company’s total domestic and

non-U.S.

credit
facilities totaled $4.0 billion, of which $175 million
was considered utilized.

5. Risk Management

Derivative Financial Instruments

Foreign Currency Risk

As a multinational company, the Company’s transactions are
denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses
financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the
effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. The
Company’s policy prohibits speculation in financial
instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation,
trading in currencies for which there are no underlying
exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to
intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that
are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be
effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
being hedged and are designated as a part of a hedging
relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly
correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged
items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of
the hedge contract.

The Company’s strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues
is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments
against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows
or investments based on the operating business units’
assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts
for some of the Company’s non-functional currency
receivables and payables, which are primarily denominated in
major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company
uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency
exposures. In addition, the Company enters into derivative
contracts for some firm commitments and some forecasted
transactions, which are designated as part of a hedging
relationship if it is determined that the transaction qualifies
for hedge accounting under the provisions of SFAS No. 133. A
portion of the Company’s exposure is from currencies that
are not traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the
extent reasonably possible, through managing net asset
positions, product pricing and component sourcing.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had net
outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling
$4.8 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not
subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange
movements because gains and losses on these contracts should
offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities
and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the
instruments, which are charged to Other within Other income
(expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations. The following table shows the five largest net
foreign exchange contract positions as of December 31, 2006
and 2005:



The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if
counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform their
obligations. However, the Company does not expect any
counterparties, all of whom presently have investment grade
credit ratings, to fail to meet their obligations.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s short-term debt
consisted primarily of $300 million of commercial paper,
priced at short-term interest rates. The Company has
$4.1 billion of long-term debt, including the current
portion of long-term debt, which is primarily priced at
long-term, fixed interest rates.

In order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in its
debt portfolio, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
to change the characteristics of interest rate payments from
fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
payments. The following table displays these outstanding
interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006:

The weighted average short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
payments on each of the above interest rate swaps was 7.29% for
the three months ended December 31, 2006. The fair value of
the above interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006 and
2005, was $(47) million and $(50) million,
respectively. Except as noted below, the Company had no
outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options
relating to debt instruments at December 31, 2006 or
December 31, 2005.

The Company designated the above interest rate swap agreements
as part of a fair value hedging relationship. As such, changes
in the fair value of the hedging instrument, as well as the
hedged debt are recognized in earnings, therefore adjusting the
carrying amount of the debt. Interest expense on the debt is
adjusted to include the payments made or received under such
hedge agreements. In the event the underlying debt instrument
matures or is redeemed or repurchased, the Company is likely to
terminate the corresponding interest rate swap contracts.

Additionally, effective December 31, 2006, one of the
Company’s European subsidiaries entered into interest rate
agreements (“Interest Agreements”) relating to a
Euro-denominated loan. The interest on the Euro-denominated loan
is floating based on

3-month

EURIBOR plus a
spread. The Interest Agreements change the characteristics of
interest rate payments from short-term EURIBOR based variable
payments to maximum fixed-rate payments. The Interest Agreements
are not accounted for as part of a hedging relationship and
accordingly the changes in the fair value of the Interest
Agreements are included in Other income (expense) in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The fair
value of the Interest Agreements at December 31, 2006 was
$1 million.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to its swap contracts. The
Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by only
dealing with leading, creditworthy financial institutions having
long-term debt ratings of “A” or better and, does not
anticipate nonperformance. In addition, the contracts are
distributed among several financial institutions, thus
minimizing credit risk concentration.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company recorded income of $0.6 million,
$1.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of fair value hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include
the change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to
the changes in the difference between the spot price and the
forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of
effectiveness. Expense (income) related to fair value hedges
that were discontinued for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 are included in the amounts noted above.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company recorded income (expense) of $13 million,
$1 million and $(12) million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedge positions. These amounts are included
in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include
the change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to
the changes in the difference between the spot price and the
forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of
effectiveness. Expense (income) related to cash flow hedges that
were discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 are included in the amounts noted above.

During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, on
a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $(98) million,
$21 million and $(27) million, respectively, was
reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. If exchange rates do not
change from year-end, the Company estimates that
$16 million of pre-tax net derivative income included in
Non-owner changes to equity within Stockholders’ equity
would be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve
months and will be reclassified in the same period that the
hedged item affects earnings. The actual amounts that will be
reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months will vary
from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions.

At December 31, 2006, the maximum term of derivative
instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was two years.
However, the weighted average duration of the Company’s
derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was
seven months.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedge

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have any
hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investments in
foreign operations.

Investments Hedge

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into a
zero-cost collar derivative (the “Sprint Nextel
Derivative”) to protect itself economically against price
fluctuations in its 37.6 million shares of Sprint Nextel
Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”) non-voting common stock.
During the second quarter of 2006, as a result of Sprint
Nextel’s spin-off of Embarq Corporation through a dividend
to Sprint Nextel shareholders, the Company received
approximately 1.9 million shares of Embarq Corporation. The
floor and ceiling prices of the Sprint Nextel Derivative were
adjusted accordingly. The Sprint Nextel Derivative was not
designated as a hedge under the



provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”. Accordingly, to
reflect the change in fair value of the Sprint Nextel
Derivative, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006, included in Other
income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statements
of operations. In December 2006, the Sprint Nextel Derivative
was terminated and settled in cash and the 37.6 million
shares of Sprint Nextel were converted to common shares and
sold. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of
approximately $820 million from the settlement of the
Sprint Nextel Derivative and the subsequent sale of the
37.6 million Sprint Nextel shares. The Company recognized a
loss of $126 million in connection with the sale of the
remaining shares of Sprint Nextel common stock. As described
above, the Company recorded a net gain of $99 million in
connection with the Sprint Nextel Derivative.

Prior to the merger of Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”)
and Nextel Communications, Inc. (“Nextel”), the
Company had entered into variable share forward purchase
agreements (the “Variable Forwards”) to hedge its
Nextel common stock. The Company did not designate the Variable
Forwards as a hedge of the Sprint Nextel shares received as a
result of the merger. Accordingly, the Company recorded
$51 million of gains for the year ended December 31,
2005 reflecting the change in value of the Variable Forwards.
The Variable Forwards were settled during the fourth quarter of
2005.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash
equivalents, Sigma Funds, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term finance receivables, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, notes payable, long-term debt, foreign
currency contracts and other financing commitments.

Using available market information, the Company determined that
the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2006 was
$4.3 billion, compared to a carrying value of
$4.1 billion. Since considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term
debt is not necessarily indicative of the amount which could be
realized in a current market exchange.

The fair values of the other financial instruments were not
materially different from their carrying or contract values at
December 31, 2006.

Components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:

Deferred tax charges (benefits) that were recorded within
Non-owner changes to equity in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets resulted primarily from fair value adjustments to
available-for-sale securities, losses on derivative instruments
and retirement benefit adjustments. The adjustments were $(182)
million, $(753) million and $(189) million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Except for
certain



earnings that the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely,
provisions have been made for the estimated U.S. federal income
taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries. Undistributed earnings that the Company intends to
reinvest indefinitely, and for which no U.S. Federal income
taxes has been provided, aggregate $4.0 billion,
$2.8 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The portion of earnings not
reinvested indefinitely may be distributed without additional
U.S. federal income taxes charges given the U.S. federal tax
provisions accrued on undistributed earnings and the utilization
of available foreign tax credits.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(“the Act”) was signed into law. The Act provides for
a special one-time tax incentive for U.S. multinationals to
repatriate accumulated earnings from their foreign subsidiaries
by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for
certain qualifying dividends. The Company repatriated
approximately $4.6 billion of accumulated earnings under
the Act and recorded an associated tax benefit of
$265 million in 2005. The Company finalized certain actions
maximizing the tax benefit attributable to the repatriation of
foreign earnings under the provisions of the Act and recognized
an additional $68 million of net tax benefits relating to
these actions during 2006.

Differences between income tax expense (benefit) computed
at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and income tax
expense (benefit) are as follows:

Significant components of deferred tax assets
(liabilities) are as follows:

Gross deferred tax assets were $8.7 billion,
$9.9 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Deferred tax assets, net of
valuation allowances, were $8.0 billion, $9.0 billion
and $8.9 billion at



December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross
deferred tax liabilities were $5.0 billion,
$5.5 billion and $5.0 billion at December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company had deferred tax assets for tax carryforwards
totaling $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of which
$1.0 billion and $1.6 billion related to U.S. tax
carryforwards. Details on the U.S. tax carryforwards at
December 31, 2006 are shown in the table below.

At December 31, 2006 the Company had valuation allowances
totaling $218 million against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
The valuation allowances relate primarily to tax carryforwards
of acquired businesses which have limitations upon their use and
state tax carryforwards with short expiration periods. During
2006, the Company recorded a $34 million valuation
allowance against deferred tax assets for certain investments
that will generate future capital losses. The Company feels that
the capital losses on these investments will likely expire
unused. The Company believes that the remaining U.S. deferred
tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable based on
estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax
planning strategies.

The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries, primarily in Germany
and the UK, had deferred tax assets from tax carryforwards of
$493 million and $530 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the
Company had $433 million of deferred tax assets for tax
carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely,
$22 million which will expire by 2009 and $38 million
that will expire by 2020. The tax carryforwards at
December 31, 2006 are comprised of $1.3 billion of tax
loss carryforwards, representing a $430 million deferred
tax balance, and $63 million of tax credit carryforwards
for a total deferred tax balance of $493 million. During
2006, the Company realized tax benefits of $194 million
relating to the reversal of valuation allowances for its
non-U.S. subsidiaries, primarily in Germany and the UK, based on
the likelihood that the Company would be able to utilize the tax
carryforwards and deferred tax assets in the future. At
December 31, 2006, the Company has recorded valuation
allowances of $522 million against its non-U.S.
subsidiaries deferred tax assets, of which $31 million of
valuation allowance relates to a 2006 acquisition that if
reversed would be offset by a reduction to goodwill. The Company
believes that the remaining deferred tax assets of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries are more likely than not to be realizable based on
estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax
planning strategies.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently
conducting its field examination of the Company’s 2001
through 2003 tax returns. In June 2006, in connection with this
examination, the Company received notices of proposed
adjustments for the 2001 and 2002 taxable years relating to
transfer pricing. These proposed adjustments are similar to
those previously made by the IRS for the Company’s
1996-2000 taxable years. The Company is currently protesting the
1996 through 2000 adjustments at the appellate level of the IRS.
The Company disagrees with all of these proposed transfer
pricing-related adjustments and intends to vigorously dispute
them through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as
appropriate. However, if the IRS were to ultimately prevail on
these matters, it could result in: (i) additional taxable
income for the years 1996 through 2000 of approximately
$1.4 billion, which could result in additional income tax
liability for the Company of approximately $500 million,
and (ii) additional taxable income for the years 2001 and
2002 of approximately $800 million, which could result in
additional income tax liability for the Company of approximately
$300 million. Although the final resolution of these
matters is uncertain, based on current information, in the
opinion of the Company’s management, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations. However, an unfavorable
resolution could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
results of operations in the periods in which the matter is
ultimately resolved.



During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company reached favorable agreements with several non-U.S.
taxing authorities that resulted in net income tax benefits of
$44 million and $28 million, respectively. The Company
has several other non-U.S. income tax audits pending and while
the final resolution is uncertain, in the opinion of the
Company’s management the ultimate disposition of the audits
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of
operations.

7. Retirement Benefits

Pension Benefit Plans

The Company’s noncontributory pension plan (the
“Regular Pension Plan”) covers U.S. employees who
became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula
is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service.
Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not
eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. On
February 20, 2007, the Company passed an amendment to the
Regular Pension Plan which changes the definition of average
earnings. Under the current formula, benefits are calculated
using the highest annual earnings in any five years within the
last ten calendar years. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit
will be based on the average of the five highest years of
earnings within the last ten calendar years prior to
December 31, 2007 averaged with future earnings. The
Company also provides defined benefit plans to some of its
foreign entities (the

“Non-U.S.

Plans”).

The Company also has a noncontributory supplemental retirement
benefit plan (the “Officers’ Plan”) for its
elected officers. The Officers’ Plan contains provisions
for funding the participants’ expected retirement benefits
when the participants meet the minimum age and years of service
requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the
Officers’ Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option
to remain in the Officers’ Plan or elect to have their
benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective
December 31, 1999, newly elected officers are not eligible
to participate in the Officers’ Plan. Effective
June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.

The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental
retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan
(“MSPP”), which provides supplemental benefits in
excess of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code
on the Regular Pension Plan. Elected officers covered under the
Officers’ Plan or who participated in the restricted stock
buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective
January 1, 2005, newly hired employees were not eligible to
participate in the MSPP. Effective January 1, 2007,
eligible compensation has been capped at the IRS limit plus
$175,000 or, for those in excess of this cap at January 1, 2007,
their current eligible compensation is frozen for calculation
purposes.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company was required to apply
SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
(“SFAS 158”) to recognize the funded status of
its defined benefit plans on its consolidate balance sheet.
SFAS 158 requires that the Company recognize, on a
prospective basis, the funded status of its defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans on its consolidated
balance sheet and recognize as a component of other
comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior
service costs or credits that have not been recognized as
components of net periodic benefit cost. The Company is also
required to disclose the incremental impact of the
implementation of SFAS 158 versus continuing to record a
minimum pension liability as previously required under SFAS
No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”
(“SFAS 87”).

The information below for

Non-U.S.

plans
covers the Company’s principal foreign plans; any other
plans are not material to the Company either individually or in
the aggregate.



The net periodic pension cost for the Regular Pension Plan,
Officers’ Plan and MSPP and

Non-U.S.

plans was
as follows:

Regular Pension Plan

Officers’ Plan and MSPP

Non-U.S.

Plans



The status of the Company’s plans is as follows:

As required under SFAS 87, after-tax charges of
$208 million and $188 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were recorded in
Non-owner changes in equity to reflect the net change in the
Company’s additional minimum pension liability associated
with these plans. With the adoption of SFAS 158, an
after-tax charge of $234 million to Non-owner changes in
equity was recorded to reflect the funded status of the
Company’s defined benefit plans on the consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2006. Had provisions of
SFAS 87 continued to apply, the Company would have
increased equity by $206 million, net of tax. Accordingly,
the incremental impact of adopting SFAS 158 on the defined
benefit plans resulted in a decrease to equity of
$440 million.



The incremental impact of applying SFAS 158 on individual
line items in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2006 for all defined benefit plans is as
follows:

The total amount included in Non-owner changes to equity
relating to defined benefit plans was $1.5 billion, net of
taxes, as of December 31, 2006. It is estimated that
pre-tax amounts of $110 million, $4 million, and
$23 million will be amortized from this balance and will be
reflected in the net periodic cost for the Regular Plan,
Officers’ and MSPP Plan, and Non-U.S. Plans, respectively,
for 2007.

The Company uses a five-year, market-related asset value method
of amortizing asset-related gains and losses. Prior service
costs are being amortized over periods ranging from 11 to
12 years. The benefit obligation and plan assets have been
measured as of December 31, 2006 for all U.S. plans
and as of October 1, 2006 for all

Non-U.S.

plans.
Benefits under all pension plans are valued based upon the
projected unit credit cost method.

Certain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the
long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant
effect on the amounts reported for net periodic cost and benefit
obligation. The assumed discount rates reflect the prevailing
market rates of a large universe of high-quality, non-callable,
corporate bonds currently available that, if the obligation were
settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary
future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. The
long-term rates of return on plan assets represents an estimate
of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a
mixture of equities, fixed income, cash and other investments
similar to the actual investment mix. In determining the
long-term return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term
rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and
forecasted) in which the Company expects the plan funds to be
invested.

The Company has adopted a pension investment policy designed to
meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets
assumption. To achieve this, the pension plans retain
professional investment managers that invest



plan assets in equity and fixed income securities and cash. In
addition, some plans invest in insurance contracts. The Company
has the following target mixes for these asset classes, which
are readjusted at least quarterly, when an asset class weighting
deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the
required return at a reasonable risk level as follows:

The weighted-average pension plan asset allocation at
December 31, 2006 and 2005 by asset categories was as
follows:

Within the equity securities asset class, the investment policy
provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded
securities including both domestic and international stocks.
Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment
policy provides for investments in a broad range of
publicly-traded debt securities ranging from U.S. Treasury
issues, corporate debt securities, mortgage and asset-backed
securities, as well as international debt securities. In the
cash and other investments asset class, investments may be in
cash, cash equivalents or insurance contracts.

The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately
$280 million to its U.S. pension plans and
approximately $120 million to its

non-U.S.

pension
plans in 2007.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan

Certain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic
employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon
termination of employment (the “Postretirement Health Care
Benefits Plan”). For eligible employees hired prior to
January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the
postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of
January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefit
Plan has been closed to new participants. The benefit obligation
and plan assets for the Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan
have been measured as of December 31, 2006.

With the adoption of SFAS 158, an after-tax charge of $74
million was recorded in Non-owner changes to equity to reflect
the funded status of the Company’s Postretirement Health
Care Benefit Plan on the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2006. Under previous accounting rules, there would
have been no balance sheet



adjustment to increase the liability as of year end.
Accordingly, the incremental impact of adopting SFAS 158 on the
Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan is $74 million.

The incremental impact of applying SFAS 158 on individual
line items in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2006 for the Postretirement Health Care
Benefit Plan is as follows:

The total amount included in Non-owner changes to equity
relating to the Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan is $74
million, net of taxes. It is estimated that a pre-tax amount of
$6 million will be amortized from this balance and will be
reflected in the net periodic cost for the Postretirement Health
Care Benefit Plan in 2007.

In connection with the spin-off of Freescale Semiconductor,
post-retirement health care benefit obligations relating to
eligible former and active vested Freescale Semiconductor
employees on December 2, 2004 (“Spin-off Date”)
and active Freescale Semiconductor employees who vest within the
three year period following the Spin-off Date were transferred
to Freescale Semiconductor. Benefit obligations transferred were
$217 million with $99 million of unrecognized net
losses also transferred to Freescale Semiconductor. Such amounts
have been excluded from the Motorola amounts for both periods
presented above. Additionally under the terms of the Employee
Matters Agreement entered into between Motorola and Freescale
Semiconductor, Motorola is obligated to transfer to Freescale
Semiconductor $68 million in cash or Plan assets plus
approximately $17 million of investment returns earned on
these plan assets as of December 31, 2006, as permitted by
law without adverse tax consequences to Motorola. This
obligation is included in Accrued liabilities in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has adopted an investment policy for plan assets
designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan
assets assumption. To achieve this, the plan retains
professional investment managers that invest plan assets in
equity and fixed income securities and cash. The Company has the

The weighted-average asset allocation for plan assets at
December 31, 2006 and 2005 by asset categories were as
follows:

Within the equity securities asset class, the investment policy
provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded
securities including both domestic and international stocks.
Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment
policy provides for investments in a broad range of
publicly-traded debt securities ranging from U.S. Treasury
issues, corporate debt securities, mortgages and asset-backed
issues, as well as international debt securities. In the cash
asset class, investments may be in cash and cash equivalents.

Cash contributions of $27 million were made to the
Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan in 2006. The Company
expects to make cash contributions of $24 million to the
retiree health care plan in 2007.



The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

The health care trend rate used to determine the
December 31, 2006 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation is 10% for 2007. Beyond 2006, the rate is assumed to
decrease by 1% per year until it reaches 5% by 2012 and
then remains flat. The health care trend rate used to determine
the December 31, 2005 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 10% for 2005 with the trend rate expected to
grade down 1% per year until reaching 5% by 2011 and then
remaining flat. Changes in the industry’s projected health
care costs have caused the graded trend rate assumption to be
reset to 10% as of December 31, 2006.

Changing the health care trend rate by one percentage point
would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
and the net retiree health care expense as follows:

The Company maintains a life time cap on postretirement health
care costs, which reduces the liability duration of the plan. A
result of this lower duration is a decreased sensitivity to a
change in the discount rate trend assumption with respect to the
liability and related expense.

The Company has no significant postretirement health care
benefit plans outside the United States.

Defined Contribution Plan

The Company and certain subsidiaries have various defined
contribution plans, in which all eligible employees participate.

In the U.S., the 401(k) plan is a contributory plan. Matching
contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’
contributions. Effective January 1, 2005, newly hired
employees have a higher maximum matching contribution at 4% on
the first 6% of employee contributions, compared to 3% for
employees hired prior to January 2005. The profit sharing
contribution for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
$69 million. Before 2005, profit sharing contributions were
generally based upon pre-tax earnings, as defined, with an
adjustment for the aggregate matching contribution. Effective
January 1, 2005, the plan was amended to exclude the profit
sharing component.

The Company’s expenses, primarily relating to the employer
match, for all defined contribution plans, for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $105 million,
$105 million and $126 million, respectively.

8. Share-Based Compensation Plans and Other Incentive
Plans

Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company grants options to acquire shares of common stock to
certain employees, non-employee directors and to existing option
holders in connection with the merging of option plans following
an acquisition. Each option granted has an exercise price of
100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
the grant. Most option awards have a contractual life of ten
years and vest over four years. Upon the occurrence of a change
in control, each stock option outstanding on the date on which
the change in control occurs will immediately become exercisable
in full.



The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through
payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible compensation on an
after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than
$25,000 of stock in any calendar year. The price an employee
pays per share is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
the Company’s stock on the close of the first trading day
or last trading day of the purchase period. The plan has two
purchase periods, the first one from October 1 through
March 31 and the second one from April 1 through
September 30. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, employees purchased 8.3 million,
11.7 million and 13.1 million shares, respectively, at
prices ranging from $19.07 to $19.82, $12.66 to $12.72 and
$10.31 to $15.33, respectively.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock
options under the intrinsic value method. Accordingly, the
Company did not recognize expense related to employee stock
options because the exercise price of such options equaled the
fair value of the underlying stock on the grant date. The
Company previously disclosed the fair value of its stock options
in its footnotes.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123R”) using the modified
prospective transition method, which requires the application of
the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first
day of the Company’s fiscal year 2006. The Company’s
consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not
been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
SFAS 123R.

Under SFAS 123R, the Company recognized $174 million,
net of taxes, of compensation expense related to stock options
and employee stock purchases for 2006, which was allocated to
the Company’s consolidated statement of operations as
follows:

Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company continued to
calculate the value of each employee stock option, estimated on
the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock
options granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $9.23, $5.75, and
$7.74, respectively, using the following weighted-average
assumptions:

In 2006, the Company began using the implied volatility for

volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. Prior
to 2006, the Company used a blended volatility rate using a
combination of historical stock price volatility and
market-implied volatility for purposes of its pro forma
information. The selection of the implied volatility approach
was based upon the availability of actively traded options on
the Company’s stock and the Company’s assessment that
implied volatility is more representative of future stock price
trends than historical volatility.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the average
daily closing rates during the year for U.S. treasury notes
that have a life which approximates the expected life of the
option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the
Company’s historical and future expectation of dividend
payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents
the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to
remain



outstanding. In 2006, the Company began using an estimated
forfeiture rate of 25% based on historical data. This estimated
forfeiture rate may be revised in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from this estimate. Prior to 2006, the
Company used the actual forfeiture method, which assumed that
all options would vest and pro forma expense was adjusted when
options were forfeited prior to the vesting dates.

Stock options activity was as follows (in thousands, except
exercise price and employee data):

*

The 39,447 options terminated, cancelled or expired includes
    approximately 22,000 options that were unvested and forfeited by
    employees of Freescale Semiconductor as of the spin-off.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $408 million of
total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, related to stock option plans and the employee
stock purchase plan that will be recognized over the weighted
average period of approximately two years. Cash received from
stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan was
$918 million, $1.2 billion and $477 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$568 million, $571 million and $70 million,
respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options
outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2006 was
$1.2 billion and $768 million, respectively.

On December 2, 2004, in connection with the spin-off of the
Company’s remaining equity interest in Freescale
Semiconductor, certain adjustments were made to outstanding
stock options. For vested and unvested options held by Motorola
employees and vested options held by Freescale Semiconductor
employees, the number of underlying shares and the exercise
price of the options were adjusted to preserve the intrinsic
value and the ratio of the exercise price to the fair market
value of an underlying share that existed immediately prior to
the distribution. In addition, the contractual life of the
vested options held by Freescale Semiconductor employees was
truncated according to the terms of the original grant. Unvested
options held by Freescale Semiconductor employees expired
according to the terms of the original grants. No other
adjustments were made to the terms of the original option grants.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, 110.9 million shares
and 79.6 million shares, respectively, were available for
future share-based award grants under the 2006 Motorola Omnibus
Plan, covering all equity awards to employees and non-employee
directors.



The following table summarizes information about stock options
outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2006 (in
thousands, except exercise price and years):

The weighted average contractual life for options outstanding
and exercisable as of December 31, 2006 was seven and six
years, respectively.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock (“RS”) and restricted stock unit
(“RSU”) grants consist of shares or the rights to
shares of the Company’s common stock which are awarded to
employees and non-employee directors. The grants are restricted
such that they are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and
to restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the employee.
Upon the occurrence of a change in control, the restrictions on
all shares of RS and RSU outstanding on the date on which the
change in control occurs will lapse.

Restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the year
ended December 31, 2006 was as follows:

At December 31, 2006, the Company had unrecognized
compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted
stock units of $66 million, expected to be recognized over
the weighted average period of approximately three years. An
aggregate of approximately 2.8 million, 1.7 million
and 1.1 million shares of restricted stock and restricted
stock units were granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The amortization of unrecognized compensation for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$24 million, $14 million and $24 million,
respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock and
restricted stock unit shares vested during the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $22 million,
$32 million and $3 million, respectively.

Total Share-Based Compensation Presentation

Under the modified prospective transition method, results for
prior periods have not been restated to reflect the effects of
implementing SFAS 123R. The following pro forma information
is presented for comparative purposes and illustrate the pro
forma effect on Earnings from continuing operations and Net
earnings and the



respective earnings per share for each period presented as if
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions to
share-based employee compensation prior to 2006 (in millions,
except per share amounts):

Prior to adopting SFAS 123R, the Company presented all tax
benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as
operating cash flows in the statements of cash flows. As a
result, $210 million and $51 million of excess tax
benefits for 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been classified
as an operating cash inflow. SFAS 123R requires cash flows
resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of
cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax benefits are
realized tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options
in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock
compensation costs for such options. As a result of adopting
SFAS 123R, $165 million of excess tax benefits for
2006 have been classified as a financing cash inflow.

Motorola Incentive Plan

The Motorola Incentive Plan provides eligible employees with an
annual payment, calculated as a percentage of an employee’s
eligible earnings, in the year after the close of the current
calendar year if specified business goals are met. The
provisions for awards under these incentive plans for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
$268 million, $548 million and $771 million,
respectively.

Mid-Range Incentive Plan

The Mid-Range Incentive Plan (“MRIP”) rewarded
participating elected officers for the Company’s
achievement of outstanding performance during the period, based
on two performance objectives measured over two-year cycles. The
provision for MRIP for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004 was $19 million and $56 million, respectively.

Long-Range Incentive Plan

In 2005, a Long-Range Incentive Plan (“LRIP”) was
introduced to replace MRIP. LRIP rewards participating elected
officers for the Company’s achievement of outstanding
performance during the period, based on two performance
objectives measured over three-year cycles. The provision for
LRIP for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
$16 million and $15 million, respectively.

Current finance receivables are included in Accounts receivable
and long-term finance receivables are included in Other assets
in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Interest
income recognized on finance receivables for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $9 million,
$7 million and $9 million, respectively. Impaired
finance receivables totaled $1 million and $10 million
at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, with
$1 million and $10 million allowance for losses at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income
on impaired finance receivables is recognized as cash is
collected and totaled less than $1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and $2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

On October 28, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement
to resolve disputes regarding Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon
Hizmetleri A.S. (“Telsim”) with Telsim and the
government of Turkey. The government of Turkey and the Turkish
Savings and Deposit Insurance Fund (“TMSF”) are
third-party beneficiaries of the settlement agreement. In
settlement of its claims, the Company received $410 million
in cash in 2006 and $500 million in cash in 2005. The
Company is permitted to, and will continue to, enforce its
U.S. court judgment against the Uzan family, except in
Turkey and three other countries.

From time to time, the Company sells short-term receivables,
long-term loans and lease receivables under sales-type leases
(collectively, “finance receivables”) to third parties
in transactions that qualify as “true-sales.” Certain
of these finance receivables are sold to third parties on a
one-time, non-recourse basis, while others are sold to third
parties under committed facilities that involve contractual
commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying
receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed
facilities may be revolving in nature. Certain sales may be made
through separate legal entities that are also consolidated by
the Company. The Company may or may not retain the obligation to
service the sold finance receivables.

In the aggregate, at December 31, 2006, these committed
facilities provided for up to $1.3 billion to be
outstanding with the third parties at any time, as compared to
up to $1.1 billion provided at December 31, 2005 and
up to $724 million provided at December 31, 2004. As
of December 31, 2006, $817 million of these committed
facilities were utilized, compared to $585 million utilized
at December 31, 2005 and $305 million utilized at
December 31, 2004. Certain events could cause one of these
facilities to terminate. In addition, before receivables can be
sold under certain of the committed facilities, they may need to
meet contractual requirements, such as credit quality or
insurability.

Total finance receivables sold by the Company were
$6.4 billion in 2006 (including $6.2 billion of
short-term receivables), compared to $4.5 billion sold in
2005 (including $4.2 billion of short-term receivables) and
$3.8 billion sold in 2004 (including $3.8 billion of
short-term receivables). As of December 31, 2006, there
were $1.1 billion of receivables outstanding under these
programs for which the Company retained servicing obligations
(including $789 million of short-term receivables),
compared to $1.0 billion outstanding at December 31,
2005 (including $838 million of short-term receivables) and
$720 million outstanding at December 31, 2004
(including $589 of short-term receivables).

Under certain of the receivables programs, the value of the
receivables sold is covered by credit insurance obtained from
independent insurance companies, less deductibles or
self-insurance requirements under the policies (with the Company
retaining credit exposure for the remaining portion). The
Company’s total credit exposure to outstanding short-term
receivables that have been sold was $19 million at
December 31, 2006 as compared to $66 million at
December 31, 2005. A reserve of $4 million was
recorded for potential losses on sold receivables at both
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005.

Certain purchasers of the Company’s infrastructure
equipment continue to request that suppliers provide financing
in connection with equipment purchases. These requests may
include all or a portion of the purchase



price of the equipment. Periodically, the Company makes
commitments to provide financing to purchasers in connection
with the sale of equipment. However, the Company’s
obligation to provide financing is often conditioned on the
issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a
reputable bank to support the purchaser’s credit or a
pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the
receivable from the Company. The Company had outstanding
commitments to extend credit to third-parties totaling
$398 million at December 31, 2006, compared to
$689 million at December 31, 2005. Of these amounts,
$262 million was supported by letters of credit or by bank
commitments to purchase receivables at December 31, 2006,
compared to $594 million at December 31, 2005.

In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment
customers, the Company also assists customers in obtaining
financing directly from banks and other sources to fund
equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide
financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling
$122 million and $140 million at December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively (including
$19 million and $66 million, respectively, relating to
the sale of short-term receivables). Customer financing
guarantees outstanding were $47 million and
$79 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively (including $2 million and $42 million,
respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables).

10. Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

The Company owns most of its major facilities, but does lease
certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, and
information technology and other equipment under principally
non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense, net of sublease
income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
was $241 million, $250 million and $205 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2006, future minimum lease
obligations, net of minimum sublease rentals, for the next five
years and beyond are as follows: 2007 —
$351 million; 2008 — $281 million;
2009 — $209 million; 2010 —
$178 million; 2011 — $158 million;
beyond — $1.2 billion.

Legal

Iridium Program:

The Company has been named as one of
several defendants in putative class action securities lawsuits
arising out of alleged misrepresentations or omissions regarding
the Iridium satellite communications business, which on
March 15, 2001, were consolidated in the federal district
court in the District of Columbia under

Freeland v.
Iridium World Communications, Inc., et al.

, originally
filed on April 22, 1999. Plaintiffs motion for class
certification was granted on January 9, 2006 and the trial is
scheduled to begin on May 22, 2008.

The Company was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured
Creditors of Iridium in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York on July 19, 2001.

In re Iridium
Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola

asserts claims
for breach of contract, warranty, fiduciary duty and fraudulent
transfer and preferences, and seeks in excess of $4 billion
in damages. Trial began on the solvency portion of these claims
on October 23, 2006.

The Company has not reserved for any potential liability that
may arise as a result of the litigation described above related
to the Iridium program. While the still pending cases are in
various stages and the outcomes are not predictable, an
unfavorable outcome of one or more of these cases could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Other:

The Company is a defendant in various other suits,
claims and investigations that arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, and other than as
discussed above with respect to the Iridium cases, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

Other

The Company is also a party to a variety of agreements pursuant
to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with
respect to certain matters. Some of these obligations arise as a
result of divestitures of the Company’s assets or
businesses and require the Company to hold the other party
harmless against losses arising from the settlement of these
pending obligations. The total amount of indemnification under
these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
$169 million and $28 million, respectively, with the
Company



accruing $95 million and $1 million as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for certain
claims that have been asserted under these provisions.

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses
that result from the breach of general warranties contained in
certain commercial, intellectual property and divestiture
agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant
payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant
claims asserted against the Company.

In all indemnification cases, payment by the Company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract, which
procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other
party’s claims. Further, the Company’s obligations
under these agreements for indemnification based on breach of
representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of
duration, typically not more than 24 months, and for
amounts not in excess of the contract value, and in some
instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties
for certain payments made by the Company.

The Company’s operating results are dependent upon our
ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality
materials, parts and components to meet the demands of our
customers. Furthermore certain of our components are available
only from a single source or limited sources. Even where
alternative sources of supply are available, qualification of
the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies
could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which may
have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.

11. Information by Segment and Geographic Region

Effective April 2006, the Company reports financial results for
the following business segments with all historical amounts
reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation:

•

The Mobile Devices segment designs, manufactures, sells and
    services wireless handsets with integrated software and
    accessory products, and licenses intellectual property.

•

The Networks and Enterprise segment designs, manufactures,
    sells, installs and services: (i) cellular infrastructure
    systems and wireless broadband systems to public carriers and
    other wireless service providers (referred to as the
    “public networks” market), and (ii) analog and
    digital two-way radio, voice and data communications products
    and systems, as well as wireless broadband systems, to a wide
    range of public safety, government, utility, transportation and
    other worldwide enterprise markets (referred to as the
    “private networks” market). In January 2007, the
    segment completed the acquisition of Symbol Technologies Inc., a
    leader in designing, developing, manufacturing and servicing
    products and systems used in

end-to

-end enterprise
    mobility solutions. Symbol will become the cornerstone of the
    segment’s enterprise mobility strategy.

•

The Connected Home Solutions segment designs, manufactures,
    sells and services: (i) cable television, Internet
    Protocol (“IP”) video and broadcast network
    set-top boxes (“digital entertainment devices”),
    (ii)

end-to

-end
    digital video system solutions, (iii) broadband access
    networks, and
    (iv)

IP-based

data
    and voice products (including modems).

Segment operating results are measured based on operating
earnings adjusted, if necessary, for certain segment-specific
items and corporate allocations. Intersegment and
intergeographic sales are accounted for on an arm’s-length
pricing basis. Intersegment sales included in other and
eliminations were:

Identifiable assets (excluding intersegment receivables) are the
Company’s assets that are identified with classes of
similar products or operations in each geographic region.

For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, of net sales were to
one customer, Sprint Nextel (including Nextel and Nextel
affiliates where appropriate). No single customer accounted for
more than 10% of net sales for the year ended December 31,
2006.



Segment information

Effective the fourth quarter 2006, the Company reflects costs
associated with the amortization of intangible assets and
in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) at
the corporate level rather than at the business segment level.
Accordingly, these costs have been reclassified for all periods
presented from the corresponding business segment to Others and
Eliminations to conform to the current period presentation.

Other as presented in Other and Eliminations above consists
primarily of (i) general corporate related expenses,
including stock option and employee stock purchase plan
expenses, (ii) various corporate programs representing
developmental businesses and research and development projects,
which are not included in any major segment, and (iii) the
Company’s wholly-owned finance subsidiary. Beginning in
2006, certain general corporate expenses, which had previously
been allocated to the business segments, are included in the
operating expenses of Other. These expenses, which were
approximately $98 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006, are no longer allocated to the operating
segments, primarily include: (i) corporate general and
administrative expenses, including strategy, legal, human
resources, finance and CEO and CFO functional staff expenses,
(ii) corporate marketing expenses, and (iii) research
and development projects.

In 2006, the Company also recorded income of $418 million
for a payment relating to the Telsim settlement, partially
offset by expenses of $88 million representing a charitable
contribution to the Motorola Foundation of appreciated equity
holdings in a third party both of which are presented in Other
and Eliminations.

Assets in Other include primarily cash and cash equivalents,
Sigma Funds, deferred income taxes, marketable securities,
property, plant and equipment, investments, and the
administrative headquarters of the Company.



Geographic area information

*

Net sales by geographic region are measured by the locale of end
    customer.

**

Excludes assets held for sale relating to discontinued
    operations of $635 million and $774 million at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

12. Shareholder Rights Plan

Effective August 1, 2006 (the “Termination
Date”), the Company terminated its shareholder rights plan.
The shareholder rights plan was scheduled to expire in November
2008. On the Termination Date, in connection with the
termination of the shareholder rights plan, the Company made the
filings necessary to eliminate all references to the
Company’s Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
Series B (“Series B”) from its Restated
Certificate of Incorporation. Accordingly, no authorized
Series B shares are reflected in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. No
Series B shares were or have been issued.

13. Reorganization of Businesses

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the
“Severance Plan”) which permits the Company to offer
eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service
and employment grade level in the event that employment is
involuntarily terminated as a result of a

reduction-in

-force or
restructuring. Each separate

reduction-in

-force has
qualified for severance benefits under the Severance Plan and,
therefore, such benefits are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 112, “Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits” (“SFAS 112”). Under the provisions
of SFAS 112, the Company recognizes termination benefits
based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time
that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably
estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a
restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs
primarily consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated
facilities. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its
accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure
the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances,
accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in
carrying out the plans or because employees previously
identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not
receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not
foreseen when the original plans were initiated. The Company
reverses accruals through the income statement line item where
the original charges were recorded when it is determined they
are no longer required.

2006 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
committed to implement various productivity improvement plans
aimed principally at: (i) reducing costs in its
supply-chain activities, (ii) integrating the former
Networks segment and Government and Enterprise Mobility
Solutions segment into one organization, the Networks and
Enterprise segment, and (iii) reducing other operating
expenses, primarily relating to engineering and development
costs. The Company recorded net reorganization of business
charges of $213 million, including $41 million of
charges in Costs of sales and $172 million of charges under
Other charges in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. Included in the aggregate $213 million are
charges of $191 million for employee separation costs,
$15 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
$30 million for exit costs, partially



offset by $23 million of reversals for accruals no longer
needed. Total employees impacted by the actions committed to in
2006 are 3,900.

The following table displays the net reorganization of business
charges by segment:

The following table displays a rollforward of the reorganization
of business accruals established for exit costs and employee
separation costs from January 1, 2006 to December 31,
2006:

(1)

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs — Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
$50 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2006 additional charges of $30 million
were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Networks
and Enterprise segment. The 2006 adjustments of $7 million
represent reversals of accruals no longer needed. The
$19 million used in 2006 reflects cash payments to lessors.
The remaining accrual of $54 million, which is included in
Accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2006, represents future cash payments
for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2006, the Company had an accrual of
$53 million for employee separation costs, representing the
severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees, of which
1,100 were direct employees and 500 were indirect employees. The
2006 additional charges of $191 million represent costs for
an additional 3,900 employees, of which 1,700 were direct
employees and 2,200 were indirect employees. The adjustments of
$16 million represent reversals of accruals no longer
needed.

During 2006, approximately 3,200 employees, of which 1,400 were
direct employees and 1,800 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $124 million used in 2006
reflects cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $104 million, which is included in
Accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2006, is expected to be paid to
approximately 2,300 employees to be separated in 2007.

2005 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
recorded net reorganization of business charges of
$91 million, including $37 million of charges in Costs
of sales and $54 million of charges under Other charges in
the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
Included in the aggregate $91 million are charges of
$86 million for employee separation costs and
$15 million for fixed asset impairment charges and
$5 million for exit costs, partially offset by
$15 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.
Total employees impacted by these action were approximately
2,600.

(1)

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs — Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$73 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2005 additional charges of $5 million
were primarily related to a lease cancellation by the Networks
and Enterprise segment. The 2005 adjustments of $7 million
represented reversals of $1 million for accruals no longer
needed and $6 million of translation adjustments. The
$21 million used in 2005 reflected cash payments to
lessors. The remaining accrual of $50 million, which was
included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2005, the Company had an accrual of
$41 million for employee separation costs, representing the
severance costs for approximately 400 employees, of which 50
were direct employees and 350 were indirect employees. The 2005
additional charges of $86 million represented the severance
costs for approximately 2,600 employees, of which 1,300 were
direct employees and 1,300 were indirect employees. The
adjustments of $14 million represented reversals of
accruals no longer needed.

During 2005, approximately 1,400 employees, of which 300 were
direct employees and 1,100 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $60 million used in 2005
reflected cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $53 million was included in Accrued
liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2005.

2004 Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
recorded net reorganization of business reversals of
$15 million, including $4 million of reversals in
Costs of sales and $11 million of reversals under Other
charges in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. Included in the aggregate $15 million are
charges of $54 million for employee separation costs,
partially offset by $63 million of reversals for accruals
no longer needed and $6 million for fixed asset adjustment
income. Total employees impacted by these actions were
approximately 800.

Includes translation adjustments.

Exit Costs — Lease Terminations

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$122 million for exit costs attributable to lease
terminations. The 2004 adjustments of $18 million
represented reversals of $29 million for accruals no longer
needed, partially offset by an $11 million translation
adjustment. The $31 million used in 2004 reflected cash
payments to lessors. The remaining accrual of $73 million,
which was included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, represents
future cash payments for lease termination obligations.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2004, the Company had an accrual of
$116 million for employee separation costs, representing
the severance costs for approximately 2,100 employees, of which
1,000 were direct employees and 1,100 were indirect employees.
The 2004 additional charges of $54 million represented the
severance costs for approximately 800 employees, of which 100
were direct employees and 700 were indirect employees. The
adjustments of $34 million represented reversals of
accruals no longer needed.

During 2004, approximately 2,500 employees, of which 1,000 were
direct employees and 1,500 were indirect employees, were
separated from the Company. The $95 million used in 2004
reflected cash payments to these separated employees. The
remaining accrual of $41 million was included in Accrued
liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2004.

Acquisitions and Related Intangibles

The Company accounts for acquisitions using purchase accounting
with the results of operations for each acquiree included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the period
subsequent to the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of
these acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements were not significant individually nor in the
aggregate.

The allocation of value to in-process research and development
was determined using expected future cash flows discounted at
average risk adjusted rates reflecting both technological and
market risk as well as the time value of money. Historical
pricing, margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used
in the valuation of the in-process products. The in-process
research and development acquired will have no alternative
future uses if the products are not feasible.



The developmental products for the companies acquired have
varying degrees of timing, technology,

costs-to

-complete and
market risks throughout final development. If the products fail
to become viable, the Company will unlikely be able to realize
any value from the sale of incomplete technology to another
party or through internal re-use. The risks of market acceptance
for the products under development and potential reductions in
projected sales volumes and related profits in the event of
delayed market availability for any of the products exist.
Efforts to complete all developmental products continue and
there are no known delays to forecasted plans.

The following is a summary of significant acquisitions in 2006,
2005 and 2004:

The following table summarizes net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and the consideration provided for the
acquisitions identified above:

Broadbus Technologies, Inc.

In September 2006, the Company acquired Broadbus Technologies,
Inc. (“Broadbus”), a leading provider of content
on-demand technologies, for $181 million in cash. The
Company recorded $131 million in goodwill, none of which is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes, a $12 million
charge for acquired in-process research and development costs,
and $30 million in identifiable intangible assets. The
acquired in-process research and development will have no
alternative future uses if the products are not feasible. At the
date of the acquisition, one project was in process. This
project is expected to be completed in 2008. The average risk
adjusted rate used to value this project was 22%. The allocation
of value to in-process research and development was determined
using expected future cash flows discounted at average risk
adjusted rates reflecting both technological and market risk as
well as the time value of money. These research and development
costs were expensed at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and
intangible assets are included in Other assets in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The intangible
assets are being amortized over periods ranging from 3 to
5 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of Broadbus have been included in the
Connected Home Solutions segment in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of

products are not feasible. At the date of the acquisition, a
total of four projects were in process. These projects are
expected to be completed in 2008. The average risk adjusted rate
used to value these projects was 18%. The allocation of value to

the time value of money. These research and development costs
were expensed at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and
intangible assets are included in Other assets in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The intangible
assets are being amortized over periods ranging from
18 months to 5 years on a straight-line basis.

The results of operations of TTPCom have been included in the

be deductible for tax purposes, a $1 million charge for
acquired in-process research and development costs, and
$22 million in identifiable intangible assets. The acquired

future uses if the products are not feasible. At the date of the
acquisition, a total of two projects were in process. These
projects have since been completed. The average risk adjusted
rate used to value these projects was 19%. The allocation of

(“MeshNetworks”), a developer of mobile mesh
networking and position location technologies that allow
customers to deploy high-performance, Internet Protocol-based
wireless broadband networks, for $169 million in cash.

The Company recorded approximately $119 million in
goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes, a $16 million charge for acquired in-process
research and development, and $20 million in other
intangibles. The acquired in-process research and development
will have no alternative future uses if the products are not
feasible. At the date of the acquisition, a total of three
projects were in process. These projects have since been
completed. The average risk adjusted rate used to value these
projects was 45%. The allocation of value to in-process research
and development was determined using expected future cash flows

money. These research and development costs were written off at
the date of acquisition and have been included in Other Charges
in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Amortized intangible assets, excluding goodwill by business
segment:

The following tables display a rollforward of the carrying
amount of goodwill from January 1, 2005 to
December 31, 2006, by business segment:

The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit
level and is a two-step analysis. First, the fair value
(“FV”) of each reporting unit is compared to its book
value. If the FV of the reporting unit is less than its book
value, the Company performs a hypothetical purchase price
allocation based on the reporting unit’s FV to determine
the FV of the reporting unit’s goodwill. FV is determined
with the help of independent appraisal firms using a combination
of present value techniques and quoted market prices of
comparable businesses. No impairment charges were required for
the year ended December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
determined that goodwill related to a sensor group, which was
subsequently divested in 2005, was impaired by a total of
$125 million.

Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior
management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective such that the information
relating to Motorola, including our consolidated subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated
and communicated to Motorola’s management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.

Motorola’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in
Rule

13a-15(f)

of
the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our senior management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, we assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, using the criteria set forth in
the

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is
effective as of December 31, 2006. KPMG LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
audit report on management’s assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2006 that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Motorola, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures,
that Motorola, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Motorola,
Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Motorola, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Also, in our opinion, Motorola, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated
February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

Stock Unit Award Agreement and Stock Option Consideration
Agreement were amended to delete references to outstanding
awards made prior to March 1, 2007.
