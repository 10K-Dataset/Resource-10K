Competition

Target’s retail merchandising business is conducted
under highly competitive conditions in the discount segment. Its stores compete
with national and local department, specialty, off-price, discount, grocery and
drug store chains, independent retail stores and Internet businesses which
handle similar lines of merchandise. Target also competes with other companies
for new store sites.

Target believes the
principal methods of competing in its industry include brand recognition,
customer service, store location, differentiated offerings, value, quality,
fashion, price, advertising, depth of selection and credit availability. Target
is a leader in supporting the communities in which it does business and
believes that it has a competitive advantage with regard to these competitive
factors.

(1)   In June of

common stock. The repurchase of our common stock is expected to be made primarily
in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and is expected to
be completed over two to three years. Since the inception of this share
repurchase program, we have repurchased a total of approximately 28 million
shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $1,275 million
($44.77 per share).

to shares purchased under our share repurchase program, we acquire shares of
common stock held by employees who wish to tender owned shares to satisfy the exercise

long-term incentive plans. From October 31, 2004 through January 29,
2005, there were no such repurchases.
