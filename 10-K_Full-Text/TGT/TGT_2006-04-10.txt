DOCUMENTS
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

1.      Portions
of Target’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders are incorporated into
Parts I, II and IV.

2.      Portions of Target’s Proxy Statement filed on April 10,
2006 are incorporated into Part III. (The Report of the Compensation

PART I

Item 1.   Business.

General

Target Corporation
(Target) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1902. Target operates large-format
general merchandise discount stores in the United States, which include Target
and SuperTarget stores. We offer both everyday essentials and fashionable,
differentiated merchandise at exceptional prices. Our ability to deliver a
shopping experience that is preferred by our guests is supported by our strong
supply chain and technology network, a devotion to innovation which is ingrained
in our organization and culture, and our disciplined approach to managing our
current business and investing in future growth. We operate as a single
business segment.

Our credit card operation
represents an integral component of our core retail business. Through our
branded proprietary credit (or REDcard) products, we strengthen the bond with
our guests, drive incremental sales and contribute meaningfully to earnings. We
also operate Target.com, an online business, which is small relative to our
overall size, but is growing at a much more rapid annual pace than our stores
and provides important benefits to our stores and to our credit card operation.

We are committed to
consistently delighting our guests, providing a workplace that is preferred by
our team members and investing to improve the quality of life in communities
where we operate. In this way, we believe we will continue to achieve
profitable market share growth and deliver superior shareholder value for many
years to come.

Financial Highlights

For information on key
financial highlights for fiscal year 2005, see the items referenced in Item 6
of this Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Due to the seasonal nature
of our business, a substantially larger share of total year revenues and
earnings occur in the fourth quarter because it includes the holiday shopping
season.

Merchandise

Target offers a wide assortment of general merchandise
and a more limited assortment of food items in our stores. SuperTarget stores
offer a full line of food items along with general merchandise. A significant
portion of Target’s sales is from nationally-advertised merchandise. In
addition, Target sells merchandise under our own private-label brands
including, but not limited to, Market Pantry

®

,
Archer Farms

®

, Merona

®

,
Xhilaration

®

, Choxie

TM

, Trutech

TM

,
and Target Limited Edition, and through unique programs such as ClearRx

SM

and Global Bazaar. Target also sells
merchandise under licensed brands including, but not limited to, Cherokee,
Mossimo, Isaac Mizrahi for Target, Michael Graves Design, Sonia Kashuk,
Woolrich, Liz Lange for Target, Simply Shabby Chic, Waverly, Fieldcrest, Thomas
O’Brien, and Smith & Hawken. Target also generates revenue from in-store
amenities such as Food Avenue

®

, pharmacies,
and photo labs, and leased or licensed departments such as Target Optical and
Starbucks.

During
the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, percentage of sales by product category
for Target were as follows:

Distribution

The majority of Target’s
merchandise is distributed through a network of 23 regional distribution
centers and three import warehouses. Certain food items are distributed by
third parties. Merchandise sold through Target.com is either distributed by
Target through our own distribution center, through third parties, or shipped
directly from vendors.

Employees

At the end of fiscal year
2005, Target employed approximately 338,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal
team members. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Working Capital

Because of the seasonal
nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the last two
fiscal quarters of each year. The increase in working capital needs during this
time is typically financed with cash flow from operations and short term
borrowings. See further discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources
section, Pages 19-20, of Target’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

Target’s retail merchandising business is conducted
under highly competitive conditions. Our stores compete with national and local
department, specialty, off-price, discount, supermarket and drug store chains,
independent retail stores and Internet businesses which sell similar lines of
merchandise. Target also competes with other companies for new store sites.

We believe the principal
methods of competing in this industry include brand recognition, customer
service, store location, differentiated offerings, value, quality, fashion,
price, advertising, depth of selection and credit availability. We believe that
we have a competitive advantage with regard to these factors. Additionally,
Target is a leader in supporting the communities in which we do business.

Intellectual
Property

Our brand image is a
critical element of our business strategy and our principal trademarks,
including Target, SuperTarget and our “bullseye” design, have been registered
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Geographic
Information

Substantially all of
Target’s revenues are generated in, and long-lived assets are located in, the
United States.

year-end we owned 22 regional distribution centers and two import warehouses,
owned one distribution center on leased land, and leased one import warehouse
on leased land for a total of 23 regional distribution centers and three import
warehouses. Target owns its corporate headquarters buildings located in

Item 9a.

Controls and
Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this annual
report, Target conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the
participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Target’s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon
that evaluation, Target’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that Target’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure
controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms.

During the third quarter of 2005, we completed the
implementation of a new suite of web-based procedures, systems and reports
designed to increase the efficiency of processing transactions and to produce
more accurate and timely financial information for our Payroll and Human
Resource teams.

Except for the preceding change, there were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during fiscal year 2005 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

on Internal Control and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting

2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, are incorporated herein by reference.

includes 1,953,382 performance shares potentially issuable under Target’s
Long-Term Incentive Plan. According to the existing plan provisions and
compensation deferral elections, approximately 34 percent of these potentially
issuable performance shares, if and when earned, will be paid in cash or
deferred through a credit to the deferred compensation accounts of the
participants in an amount equal to the value of any earned performance shares. The
actual number of performance shares to be issued, cash to be paid, or credits
to be made to deferred compensation accounts, if any, depends on Target’s
financial performance over a period of time. Performance shares do not have an
exercise price and thus they have been excluded from the weighted-average
exercise price calculation in column (b).
