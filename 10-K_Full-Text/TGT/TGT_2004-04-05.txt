Competition

The Registrant's retail merchandising business is conducted under highly competitive conditions in the discount, middle market and department store retail
segments. Its stores compete with national and local department, specialty, off-price, discount, grocery and drug store chains, independent retail stores and Internet and catalog
businesses which handle similar lines of merchandise. The Registrant also competes with other companies for new store sites.

The
Registrant believes the principal methods of competing in its industry include brand recognition, customer service, store location, differentiated offerings, value, quality, fashion,
price, advertising, depth of selection and credit availability. The Registrant is a leader in community involvement programs and believes that it is in a strong competitive position with regard to
these competitive factors.

Concurrent
with our August 22, 2001 issuance of receivable backed securities, SFAS No. 140 (which replaced SFAS No. 125 in its entirety) became the guidance applicable to our
receivable-backed securities transactions. As described in detail in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 31 of Registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders, this transaction and the
application of SFAS No. 140 resulted in a number of accounting changes including the reclassification of the owned receivable-backed securities to accounts receivable at fair value.
