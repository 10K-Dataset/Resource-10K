Competition

The Registrant's retail merchandising business is conducted under highly competitive conditions in the discount, middle market and department store retail
segments. Its stores compete with national and local department, specialty, off-price, discount and drug store chains, independent retail stores and Internet and catalog businesses which
handle similar lines of merchandise. The Registrant also competes with other companies for new store sites.

The
Registrant believes the principal methods of competing in its industry include brand recognition, customer service, store location, differentiated offerings, value, quality,
fashion, price, advertising, depth of selection and credit availability. The Registrant is a leader in community involvement programs and believes that it is in a strong competitive position with
regard to these competitive factors.
