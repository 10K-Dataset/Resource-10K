PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Target Corporation (the Corporation or Target) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1902. We operate as two reportable segments: Retail and
Credit Card.

Our
Retail Segment includes all of our merchandising operations, including our large-format general merchandise and food discount stores in the United States and our fully integrated
online business. We offer both everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated merchandise at exceptional prices. Our ability to deliver a shopping experience that is preferred by our guests is
supported by our strong supply chain and technology infrastructure, a devotion to innovation that is ingrained in our organization and culture, and our disciplined approach to managing our current
business and investing in future growth. As a component of the Retail Segment, our online business strategy is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly either online or by locating
them in one of our stores with the aid of on-line research and location tools. Our online shopping site offers similar merchandise categories to those found in our stores, excluding food
items and household commodities.

Our
Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and the Target Card (collectively, REDcards). Our Credit Card
Segment strengthens the bond with our guests, drives incremental sales and contributes to our results of operations.

Prior
to 2008, we operated as a single business segment. Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Financial Highlights

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to
fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended January 31, 2009 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended February 2, 2008 and consisted
of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 (2006) ended February 3, 2007 and consisted of 53 weeks.

For
information on key financial highlights, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, a substantially larger share of total annual revenues and earnings traditionally occurs in
the fourth quarter because it includes the peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December.

Merchandise

We operate Target general merchandise stores with a wide assortment of general merchandise and a limited assortment of food items, as
well as SuperTarget stores with a full line of food and general merchandise items. Target.com offers a wide assortment of general merchandise including many items found in our stores and a
complementary assortment, such as extended sizes and colors, sold only online. A significant portion of our sales is from national brand merchandise. In addition, we sell merchandise under
private-label brands including, but not limited to, Archer Farms®, Boots & Barkley®, Choxie®, Circo®, Durabuilt®,
Embark®, Garden Place®, Gilligan & O'Malley®, itso™, Kaori®, Market Pantry®, Merona®,
Playwonder®, Room Essentials®, Sutton and Dodge®, Target Brand, Target Home, Trutech®, Vroom®, Wine Cube®, and
Xhilaration®. We also sell merchandise through unique programs such as ClearRx

SM

, GO International®, and Home Design Event. In addition, we sell merchandise under
licensed brands including, but not limited to, C9 by Champion, Chefmate, Cherokee, Converse One Star, Eddie Bauer, Fieldcrest, Genuine Kids by Osh Kosh, Kitchen Essentials by Calphalon, Liz Lange for
Target, Michael Graves Design, Mossimo, Nick & Nora, Perfect Pieces by Victoria Hagan, Sean Conway, Simply Shabby Chic, Smith & Hawken, Sonia Kashuk, Thomas O'Brien,



Waverly
and Woolrich. We also generate revenue from in-store amenities such as Food Avenue®, Target Clinic®, Target Pharmacy

SM

, and Target
Photo

SM

, and from leased or licensed departments such as Optical, Pizza Hut, Portrait Studio and Starbucks.

Distribution

The vast majority of our merchandise is distributed through our network of distribution centers. We operated 34 distribution centers at
January 31, 2009. General merchandise is shipped to and from our distribution centers by common carriers. Certain food items are distributed by third parties. Merchandise sold through
Target.com is distributed through our own distribution network, through third parties, or shipped directly from vendors.

Employees

At January 31, 2009, we employed approximately 351,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees,
referred to as "team members." During our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December, our employment levels peaked at approximately 400,000 team members. We consider our team member
relations to be good. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our team members. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies, depending on team members'
full-time or part-time status, compensation level, date of hire and/or length of service. These company-paid benefits include a pension plan, 401(k) plan, medical
and dental plans, a retiree medical plan, short-term and long-term disability insurance, paid vacation, tuition reimbursement, various team member assistance programs, life
insurance and merchandise discounts.

Working Capital

Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period
from Thanksgiving to the end of December. The increase in working capital during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and short-term borrowings.

Additional
details are provided in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Competition

In our Retail Segment, we compete with traditional and off-price general merchandise retailers, apparel retailers, Internet
retailers, wholesale clubs, category specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce. Our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely determines
our competitive position within the retail industry.

In
our Credit Card Segment, our primary mission is to deliver financial products and services that drive sales and deepen guest relationships at Target. Our financial products compete
with those of other issuers for market share of sales volume. Our ability to differentiate the value of our financial products primarily through our rewards programs, terms, credit line management,
and guest service determines our competitive position.

Intellectual Property

Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, SuperTarget and our
"Bullseye Design," have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.



Geographic Information

Substantially all of our revenues are generated in, and long-lived assets are located in, the United States.

Available Information

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

Our business is subject to a variety of risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our
guests and a brand they trust. Meeting our guests' expectations requires us to manage various operational and financial risks. Set forth below are the most significant risks that we face.

Our success depends on our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers.

The retail business is highly competitive. In the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping
experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, guest service and marketing efforts. Guest perceptions regarding the
cleanliness and safety of our stores and our in-stock levels are also factors in our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of
these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margin and expenses. If we fail to continue to positively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could
be adversely affected.

If we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margin and profitability could suffer.

A substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend-right decisions in apparel, home décor,
seasonal offerings and other merchandise. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to lost sales,
increased markdowns on inventory and adversely affect our results of operations.

All of our stores are located within the United States, making us highly susceptible to deteriorations in U.S. macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence.

All of our stores are located within the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health
of the U.S. economy. In addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Illinois, resulting in further
dependence on local economic conditions in these states. The success of our credit card business is also highly dependent on consumers' willingness to use credit cards over other payment methods,
their ability to pay and our ability to anticipate changes to the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could
negatively impact our business in many ways, including:

•

Slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales.

•

Reducing gross margins.

•

Increasing our expenses, including bad debt expense.



If we do not continually attract, train and retain qualified employees, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our business is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members. Many of
those team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external
factors such as unemployment levels, health care costs and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, guest service
levels and support functions could suffer, and we could experience delays in opening new stores. Those factors, together with increased wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of
operations.

Inability to build new stores in suitable locations could slow our growth, and difficulty in building new stores could increase our costs and capital requirements.

Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build new stores and expand existing stores in a manner that achieves
appropriate returns on our capital investment. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. In addition, for many sites we are dependent on a third party
developer's ability to acquire land, obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project, of which our store may be one component. Turmoil in the financial
markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact
our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing and expanding our stores. A significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned to occur
within fully developed markets, which is generally a more time-consuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets. Delays in new
store openings could have an adverse effect on our sales growth, and increased costs associated with new stores and store expansions could adversely affect our results of operations.

Interruptions in our supply chain could adversely affect our results.

We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its
commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales. In addition, a large portion of our merchandise is
sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, the
outbreak of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security or other events that could slow port activities and impact foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our
supply of merchandise and adversely affect our results of operations.

Product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.

If our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children's products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests'
expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety
laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food
or drug contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative guest perceptions
regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us
to regain the confidence of our guests.

If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our
reputation could suffer.

The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests. If we experience a data security
breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could
cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products, decline to use our pharmacy



services,
or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks.

Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our
workforce (none of which is represented by unions as of the end of 2008) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes impacting our
relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed,
minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, certain aspects of our business, such as our pharmacy and credit card operations, are more heavily regulated than other areas. Changes
in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit, Medicare reimbursements, privacy and information security, product safety or environmental protection, among others,
could cause our expenses to increase. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, particularly wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government
enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Given the geographic concentration of our stores, natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our three largest states, by total sales, are California, Texas and Florida, areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent. Such
events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our
distribution centers and stores, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations.

Our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors, including statutory tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets
and liabilities, and, due to the method by which we economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities, changes in capital market returns. Changes in the tax laws, the interpretation of existing
laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate bears an inverse relationship to
capital market returns due principally to our use of company-owned life insurance as an investment vehicle to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities.

If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our growth plans, liquidity and results of operations could suffer.

We are dependent on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans. In
particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures, the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to
fund seasonal needs for working capital, and the asset-backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio. In addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our
exposure to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements,
fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures.

Operations and Notes 13 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

SEC Rule S-K Item 103 requires that companies disclose environmental legal proceedings
involving a governmental authority when such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.



We
are a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by the California Attorney General in October 2008 alleging that we sold certain products that contained volatile organic compounds in excess
of regulated limits (windshield washer fluid and air fresheners) and other products that were not approved for sale in
California (gas cans and gas generators). The case is in its early stages and settlement discussions are continuing. We anticipate that any resolution of this matter is likely to exceed $100,000 but
will not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we are one of many defendants in a lawsuit filed on February 13, 2008, by the State of
California involving environmental matters that may involve potential monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000. The allegation, initially made by the California Air Resources Board in April 2006,
involves a non-food product (hairspray) that allegedly contained levels of a volatile organic compound in excess of permissible levels. We anticipate that the settlement, to be fully
indemnified by the vendor, is likely to exceed $100,000 but will not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 requires SEC registrants to disclose if they have been required to pay certain penalties for failing to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service
their participation in listed transactions. We have not been required to pay any of the penalties set forth in Section 6707A(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Executive Summary

Our financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year reflect the impact of adverse economic conditions on our
business segments. Our Retail Segment results were affected by changes in consumer spending patterns that negatively impacted our traffic and sales, particularly in higher margin discretionary
categories, creating an elevated level of markdowns resulting from weaker than expected sales. Our Credit Card Segment performance, like that of other credit card issuers, was adversely affected by
the deteriorating credit and risk environment. As a result, we incurred higher-than-expected bad debt expense as we both wrote-off accounts and added significantly
to our allowance for doubtful accounts. In light of this challenging retail and credit environment, we have suspended our share repurchase program and reduced spending on new store construction and
remodels.

Sales
totaled $62,884 million in 2008, $61,471 million in 2007 and $57,878 million in 2006, increasing 2.3 percent in 2008 and 6.2 percent in 2007.
Comparable-store sales (as defined below) in 2008 declined 2.9 percent from 2007; comparable-store sales in 2007 grew 3.0 percent from 2006. Credit card revenues were
$2,064 million, $1,896 million and $1,612 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, increasing 8.9 percent in 2008 and 17.6 percent in 2007. The combination of
retail and credit card operations produced earnings before interest expense and income taxes of $4,402 million in 2008, $5,272 million in 2007 and $5,069 million in 2006,
decreasing 16.5 percent in 2008 and increasing 4.0 percent in 2007. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,430 million, $4,125 million and $4,862 million for 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, we paid dividends of $465 million in 2008, $442 million in 2007 and $380 million in 2006. We opened 114 new stores in 2008, or 91 stores
net of 21 relocations and two closings. In 2007, we opened 118 new stores representing 103 stores net of 14 relocations and one closing.

Management's
Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Sales

Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer
to Note 2 for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for the 2008 year were $62,884 million, compared with $61,471 million in 2007 and
$57,878 million in 2006. The 2008 and 2007 periods were
52-week years compared to the 2006 period that was a 53-week year. Growth in total sales between 2008 and 2007 resulted from sales from stores opened in 2008, offset by lower
comparable-store sales. The increase in total sales between 2007 and 2006 is attributable to both new stores and comparable-store sales increases. In 2008, inflation affected sales growth by
approximately 2 percentage points, compared with a deflationary impact of 2 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2006.

Comparable-store sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a
period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store
sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, beginning in 2007, we changed our comparable-store sales calculation to include
sales from our online business because we believe this combined measure represents a more useful disclosure in light of our fully integrated, multi-channel approach to our business.

Comparable-store
sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including:

•

sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open

•

sales from stores that have been relocated to new
buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the
new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes

Comparable-store
sales do not include:

•

sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget
store format

•

sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed

The comparable-store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing
sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length.

In 2008, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, slightly offset by an increase in average
transaction amount, which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction. In fiscal 2007, the comparable store sales
increase was driven primarily by an increase in average transaction amount when compared to 2006, with both the number of units and selling price per unit sold, each representing roughly half of the
increase attributable to average transaction amount. Transaction-level metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, and comparable-store sales
rates is negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores.



Gross Margin Rate

Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of
expenses included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor
offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous
price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions.

In
2008, our consolidated gross margin rate was 29.8 percent compared with 30.2 percent in 2007. Our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix, which
resulted in a 0.6 percentage point reduction in the gross margin rate. Sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates (generally non-discretionary product
categories of consumables and commodities) outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories. This mix impact was partially offset by favorable supply chain expense rates, as
well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment, which had a combined favorable impact on gross margin rate of approximately 0.2 percentage point.

In
2007, our consolidated gross margin rate was consistent with the 2006 gross margin rate. Our gross margin rate for 2007 benefited from higher margin rates within merchandise
categories. Substantially all of this benefit was offset by the adverse effects from sales of lower margin merchandise categories outpacing sales of higher margin merchandise categories. During 2007,
rate improvement within categories was driven generally by an array of inventory control initiatives that minimized markdowns.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate

Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a
description of expenses included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

SG&A
expense rate was 20.4 percent in 2008, which was the same as 2007 and consistent with 20.3 percent in 2006. Within SG&A expenses in 2008 and 2007, there were no
expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation as a percentage of sales, when compared to prior periods. These expense rates reflect sustained productivity gains in our stores and
disciplined expense control across the Corporation.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate

Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2008, our
depreciation and amortization expense rate was 2.9 percent compared with 2.7 percent in 2007 and 2.6 percent in 2006. The comparative increases in 2008 and 2007 were due to
increased capital expenditures, specifically related to investments in new stores. During 2006, we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms
for individual leases, resulting in a cumulative benefit to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $28 million.

Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the vast majority of our portfolio earns finance charge revenue at rates tied to
the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.

Our primary measure of profitability in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the
interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital Target has invested in our credit card receivables.
In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates the credit
performance and overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing
cost applied to the entire portfolio. The vast majority of our portfolio accrues finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by
credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.

Segment
profit and dollar spread to LIBOR measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense. Segment revenues were $2,064 million,
an increase of $168 million, or 8.9 percent, from the prior year, driven by a 19.5 percent increase in average receivables. On a rate basis,



revenue
yield decreased 2.4 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the Prime Rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume
contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees. This negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our
effective yield. Segment expenses were $1,742 million, an increase of $776 million, or 80.3 percent, from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of
$770 million. The increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net write-off rate from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 9.3 percent in 2008 and the
increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $440 million for anticipated future write-offs of current receivables. Segment profit decreased from 16.3 percent in 2007
to 3.7 percent in 2008 primarily due to the effect of bad debt expense, the reduction in receivables owned and funded by Target, and the impact of a lower Prime Rate during 2008.

segment revenues were $1,896 million, an increase of $284 million, or 17.6 percent, from the prior year, driven by a higher average receivables balance. The
annualized rates for the components of segment revenue were consistent with prior periods. Segment expenses were $966 million, an increase of $136 million, or 16.4 percent, from
2006. This increase was due to bad debt expense in 2007 which rose reflecting an increase in net write-offs and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of higher
expected future losses on period-end receivables. Segment ROIC benefited from a slightly higher percentage of third party funding of our credit card receivables.

We
implemented a terms change to our portfolio, effective in April 2009, that establishes a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to a receivables balance as a finance charge.
Under this terms change, finance charges will accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than a threshold amount; if the Prime Rate is greater than the threshold, finance charges will
accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread.

Our 2008 period-end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of
5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary
Target Cards to higher-limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card
usage by our guests, and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk guests.



2007 period-end receivables were $8,624 million compared with $6,711 million in 2006, an increase of 28.5 percent. Average
receivables in 2007 increased 18.1 percent to $7,275 million from $6,161 million. This growth in receivables measure was driven primarily by a product change from proprietary
Target Cards to Target Visa cards for a group of higher credit-quality Target Card Guests. A product change to a Target Visa card generally results in a higher receivables balance because it can be
used for purchases outside of Target stores and has a higher credit limit. Accounts converted from a Target Card to a Target Visa accounted for approximately 20 percentage points of the growth
in period-end receivables. The remainder of our year-over-year receivables growth was primarily due to a reduction in payment rates on non-converted
accounts.

Other Performance Factors

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was $866 million at the end of 2008, increasing 33.8 percent, or $219 million from 2007. This
increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest
rate. In 2007, net interest expense was $647 million compared with $572 million in 2006, an increase of 13.2 percent. This increase related to higher average debt balances,
including the debt to fund growth in accounts receivable. The average portfolio interest rate was 5.3 percent in 2008, 6.1 percent in 2007 and 6.2 percent in 2006.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 37.4 percent in 2008, 38.4 percent in 2007 and 38.0 percent in 2006. The
decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate is also lower due to a
comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to
economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable. The increase in the 2007 effective rate from the prior year was primarily
due to lower capital market returns on these investments as compared to 2006.

Workforce Reduction

In 2008, we recorded a $47 million charge related to workforce reduction actions, approximately $21 million of which
related to actions announced in January 2009 affecting our headquarters population. This charge was comprised of severance and benefit costs of $37 million and other expenses, primarily early
lease exit costs, of $10 million. At the end of 2008, the remaining liability balance relating to severance costs was approximately $31 million. We believe that the liability will be
substantially extinguished by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The liability is recorded as a component of other current liabilities and the expenses are recorded as a component of SG&A.

We
will incur costs in 2009 for workforce reduction actions announced in 2008 but where team members are required to provide future services. We estimate those costs will be
approximately $11 million and generally represent severance and benefits costs to be paid during 2009.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We continue to fund our operations and growth through a combination of internally generated funds and debt financing. Cash flow
provided by operations was $4,430 million in 2008 compared with $4,125 million in 2007.

Our
2008 period-end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008
increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher-limit Target Visa cards
and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly



reduced
credit lines and from notable reductions in card usage. As further described in Note 10, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to a JPMorgan Chase affiliate (JPMC). The
interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the transaction.

Year-end
inventory levels decreased $75 million, or 1.1 percent from 2007, reflecting inventory management initiatives responding to declining consumer demand
offset by increased inventory levels required to support comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable decreased by 5.7 percent over the same period.

During
2008, we repurchased 67.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $3,395 million ($50.49 per share) under a $10 billion share
repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2007 we repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,642 million
($57.24 per share). In November 2008 we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open-market share repurchase program.

We
declared dividends totaling $471 million ($0.62 per share) in 2008, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2007. In 2007 we declared dividends totaling $454 million
($0.54 per share), an increase of 14.6 percent over 2006. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our
intent to continue to do so in the future.

Our
financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt
maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs.

Maintaining
strong investment-grade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy. Our current debt ratings are as follows:

(a)

These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC.

At January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We fund our peak
sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and typically use the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. Additionally and as described
in Note 10, we sold to JPMC an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately $3.8 billion. We received proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion, reflecting a
7 percent discount.

An
additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will
expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2008 or 2007 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities.

Most
of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a
debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 31, 2009, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration
of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a
change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are
placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.

Our
interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of
rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SEC's applicable rules was 4.3x in 2008, 6.4x in 2007 and 7.1x in 2006.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $3,547 million in 2008, compared with $4,369 million in 2007 and $3,928 million in 2006.
This decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores, remodels and technology-related assets. Our 2008 capital expenditures include $1,258 million related to stores that will



open
in 2009 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $1,661 million in 2008 following an increase of $2,664 million in 2007.

(d)

Estimated tax contingencies of $447 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates
of the period of cash settlement.

Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations
include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license
commitments and service contracts.

We
issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to
be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these
obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to
cancellation.

We
have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans
has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans,
including our expected contributions for 2009, is included in Note 27.

We
do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or
the availability of capital resources.



Critical Accounting Estimates

Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis
and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our
senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial
statements require significant estimation or judgment:

Inventory and cost of sales

We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method,
inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's
ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the
lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts.
Historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has
diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets or increasing
competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than six months. Inventory is further described in Note 11.

Vendor income receivable

Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is
earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the
vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and the amount earned. The
majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Vendor income is described further in Note 4.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future
write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of
delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when
they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions;
however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. We believe that the allowance
recorded at January 31, 2009 is sufficient to cover currently anticipated losses. Credit card receivables are described in Note 10.

Analysis of long-lived and intangible assets for impairment

We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually
at the store level. An impairment loss on a long-lived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and
disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounted future cash flows. No
material impairments were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed.

Insurance/self-insurance

We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and
team member medical and dental claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate



our
ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value;
other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We maintain stop-loss
coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with our insurance policies.

Income taxes

We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax
issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22.

Pension and postretirement health care accounting

We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified
plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in
the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of
service.

Our
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market
conditions.

The
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the
measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine pension and
postretirement health care expense for the following plan year. Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" (SFAS 158). The discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and
benefits expense are included in Note 27. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.1 percent increase to the weighted
average discount rate used to determine pension and postretirement health care expenses would decrease annual expense by approximately $4 million.

Based
on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does
for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.

Pension
and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27.

New Accounting Pronouncements

2008 Adoptions

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value,
provides guidance for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157, as originally issued, was effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, which deferred the effective date of SFAS 157
for one year, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. We adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008, and the adoption had
no impact to our consolidated net earnings, cash flows and financial position. Subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 157, the FASB has issued various other FASB Staff Positions and guidance on
fair value measurement; the additional guidance has not had an impact on our adoption. We will adopt SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities at the beginning of 2009 and do not expect
to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We adopted SFAS 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2008, and the adoption had no impact to our consolidated net
earnings, cash flows or financial position.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" (SFAS 161).
SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 161, as originally issued, was effective at the beginning of fiscal



2009.
However, in October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, which, amongst other actions, accelerated the effective date of
SFAS 161 to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Since SFAS 161 requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging
activities, the adoption of SFAS 161 did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.

In
November 2008, the FASB Staff Position FAS 140-e and FIN 46(R)-e, Disclosures about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable
Interest Entities (the FSP) was published with an effective date for periods ending December 15, 2008. The FSP is intended to enhance currently required disclosures until the pending amendments
to SFAS 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities," are published. Since the FSP requires only additional disclosures related to certain asset transfers, the adoption of the FSP did not have any impact on our consolidated
net earnings, cash flows or financial position.

Future Adoptions

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141(R)), which changes the accounting
for business combinations and their effects on the financial statements. SFAS 141(R) will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51"
(SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as equity in their consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 will be effective at the
beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is
not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.

Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009

We anticipate that the challenging economic and consumer environment we experienced in 2008 will continue into 2009. In the first half
of 2009, in our Retail Segment, we expect a continuation of recent sales trends – specifically mid-single digit declines in overall comparable-store sales with stronger
growth in our lower-margin non-discretionary categories than in our higher-margin home and apparel categories. This sales performance will likely lead to a moderate decline in our gross
margin rate because it is unlikely that we will be able to offset the impact of the adverse sales mix with rate improvements within categories. Even in light of continued strong expense control, we
expect a moderate de-leveraging in our SG&A expense rate as a result of our expectation for soft comparable store sales. As a result, we expect to generate EBITDA and EBIT in our Retail
Segment below last year's levels for the first half of the year.

In
our Credit Card Segment we expect net write-offs to stabilize in the range of $300 million in each of the first two quarters of 2009, levels which were anticipated
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of fiscal 2008. We do not anticipate the need to add any meaningful reserves in the foreseeable future, especially in light of the high
likelihood that we will experience modest decreases in gross receivables. Overall, we expect to generate moderate rates of profit in the Credit Card Segment in the first two quarters of 2009, though
it is not likely to be as strong as the profits generated in the first two quarters of 2008.

In
light of the current environment, we are being very deliberate in the management and application of cash resources. This means that we have planned for fewer stores to open in 2009,
particularly in our October cycle, than we would have in a more robust environment. Specifically, we expect to open about 75 stores in 2009, or about 60 stores net of rebuilds and relocations. Based
on these store opening expectations, our base capital investment plan for 2009 envisions investing just over $2 billion, with the possibility that it might be as high as $2.5 billion if
we were to see clear and measurable signs of improvement in the economy that lead us to approve incremental store openings in 2010 and beyond.

We
expect to again generate more than $4 billion in cash from operations in 2009, which, in light of our current suspension of substantially all share repurchase activity, would
provide ample cash from internal sources to fund our projected capital investments, pay dividends on our common stock and fund the $1.3 billion of debt that is maturing in 2009, all without the
need to access the term debt capital markets during the year.

Our
expectation is for earnings per share (diluted) in the first two quarters of 2009 to be well below 2008 levels, in line with our experience in the fourth quarter of 2008. Whether our
performance will improve in the



last
two quarters of 2009 will depend on the extent to which economic conditions improve, and in turn to what extent our Retail Segment sales improve, and to a lesser degree when, and to what extent,
we begin to experience clear and measurable benefits of recent risk management efforts in the Credit Card Segment.

Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are
typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include:
The expected earnings per share (diluted) for the first two quarters of 2009; for our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales trends, gross margin rates, SG&A expense rate, and EBITDA and EBIT; for our
Credit Card Segment, our outlook for future write-offs of current receivables, profit, and the allowance for doubtful accounts; the expected cash generated from operations in 2009; our expected
capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2009; the expected compliance with debt covenants; and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation, property
loss, team member medical and dental claims, workforce reduction costs, the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties.

All
such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our
actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in
conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking
statement.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at
a LIBOR-plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime-based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we
generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. Our degree of floating asset and liability
matching may vary over time and vary in different interest rate environments. At January 31, 2009, our level of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded our level of net
floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $1.3 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a half percentage
point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income
taxes by approximately $7 million. See further description in Note 20.

We
record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically and in
certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest
rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a one percentage point
decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $19 million.

In
addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on
pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $18 million at January 31, 2009. The resulting impact on net pension expense would be calculated consistent with the provisions of SFAS
No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions." The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold
high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of
our funded status.

As
more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation
plans. We control our risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion
of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect
of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.

We
do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in
U.S. dollars.

Overall,
there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.



Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity and presentation of the information in the Annual Report. The consolidated
financial statements and other information presented in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include necessary
judgments and estimates by management.

To
fulfill our responsibility, we maintain comprehensive systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in
accordance with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of
internal control provide this reasonable assurance.

The
Board of Directors exercised its oversight role with respect to the Corporation's systems of internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised of four
independent directors. The Committee oversees the Corporation's systems of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and audits to assess whether their quality, integrity and
objectivity are sufficient to protect shareholders' investments.

In
addition, our consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, whose report also appears on this
page.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Target Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of January 31,
2009 and February 2, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended January 31,
2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries at
January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 27, Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans, to the consolidated financial statements, effective February 3, 2007, the Corporation adopted the
recognition and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

Also, effective February 4, 2007, the Corporation adopted the
measurement provision of SFAS No. 158.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we conclude that the Corporation's internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered accounting firm who has also
audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report which appears on this page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Target Corporation

We have audited Target Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). The Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Target
Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders' investment for each of the
three years in the period ended January 31, 2009, and our report dated March 11, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Organization

Target Corporation (the Corporation or Target) operates two reportable segments: Retail and Credit Card. Our Retail Segment includes all of our
merchandising operations, including the operation of our large-format general merchandise and food discount stores in the United States and our fully integrated online business, Target.com. Our Credit
Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and the Target Card (collectively, REDcards). Our Credit Card Segment strengthens the bond
with our guests, drives incremental sales and contributes to our results of operations.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the balances of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and
transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of those entities'
operations. The variable interest entity consolidated is a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary through which we sell certain accounts receivable as a method of providing funding for our accounts receivable.

Use of estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years,
rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended January 31, 2009 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended February 2, 2008 and consisted of
52 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 (2006) ended February 3, 2007 and consisted of 53 weeks.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Accounting
policies applicable to the items discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement are described in the respective notes.

2. Revenues

Our retail stores generally record revenue at the point of sale. Sales from our online business include shipping revenue and are
recorded upon delivery to the guest. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return
merchandise within 90 days of purchase. Revenues are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns. Commissions earned on sales generated by leased
departments are included within sales and were $19 million in 2008, $17 million in 2007, and $16 million in 2006. A leased business is an agreement we enter into with another
entity such as Starbucks or Pizza Hut where the entity's products and services are offered in our stores.

Revenue
from gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption. Our gift cards do not have expiration dates. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable
percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was immaterial in 2008,
2007, and 2006.

Credit
card revenues are recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement. When accounts are written off, uncollected finance charges and late fees are
recorded as a reduction of credit card revenues. Target retail store sales charged to our credit cards totaled $3,854 million, $4,105 million, and $3,961 million in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. We offer new account discounts and rewards programs on our REDcard products. These discounts are redeemable only on purchases made at Target. The discounts associated with our
REDcard products are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were $114 million in 2008, $110 million in 2007 and $104 million in 2006.



3. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

During the first quarter of 2008, we reviewed our Consolidated Statements of Operations cost classification policy, primarily related
to distribution and other supply chain costs that were previously classified within selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). The review was prompted by changes within our supply chain
processes and infrastructure, primarily the opening of our own food distribution network. As a result of this review, we have reclassified certain costs within our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The most significant change is that distribution center costs are now presented within cost of sales, as opposed to SG&A. We have reclassified all prior periods to conform to the current
year presentation.

The
following table illustrates the primary costs classified in each major expense category:

Cost of Sales

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Total cost of products sold including

•   Freight expenses associated with moving

merchandise from our vendors to our

distribution centers and our retail stores, and

among our distribution and retail facilities

•   Vendor income that is not reimbursement of

specific, incremental and identifiable costs

Inventory shrink

Markdowns

Outbound shipping and handling expenses

associated with sales to our guests

Terms cash discount

Distribution center costs, including compensation

and benefits costs

Compensation and benefit costs including

•   Stores

•   Headquarters

Occupancy and operating costs of retail and

headquarters facilities

Advertising, offset by vendor income that is a

reimbursement of specific, incremental and

identifiable costs

Pre-opening costs of stores and other facilities

Other administrative costs

The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.

4. Consideration Received from Vendors

We receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and
advertising and for our compliance programs, referred to as "vendor income." Vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or SG&A based on the provisions of the arrangement. Promotional and
advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores. Under our compliance programs, vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not
meet our requirements (violations), such as late or incomplete shipments. These allowances are recorded when violations occur. Substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of
cost of sales.

We
establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating the amount
earned when we have completed our performance. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate. The majority of year-end receivables
associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter.

5. Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement and were $1,233 million in 2008,
$1,195 million in 2007 and $1,170 million in 2006. Advertising vendor income that offset advertising expenses was approximately $143 million, $123 million and
$118 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Newspaper circulars and media broadcast made up the majority of our advertising costs in all three years.



6. Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and the incremental shares assumed to be issued under performance share and restricted stock unit
arrangements.

excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive. Refer to Note 26 for a description of the prepaid forward contracts referred to
in the table above.

7. Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)

Other comprehensive income/(loss) includes revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings under GAAP and are
recorded directly to shareholders' investment. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, other comprehensive income/(loss) included gains and losses on certain hedge transactions, the change in our minimum pension
liability (prior to the adoption of SFAS 158), and amortization of pension and postretirement plan amounts, net of related taxes. Significant items affecting other comprehensive income/(loss)
are shown in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Investment.

8. Fair Value Measurements

In the first quarter of 2008, we adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price at which an asset could be exchanged
in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that
would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSPs FAS 157-1 and FAS 157-2, which removed leasing transactions from
the scope of SFAS 157 and deferred for one year the effective date for SFAS 157 as it applies to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities.

Assets
and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized using defined hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair
valuation of an asset or liability: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in
Level 1, either directly or indirectly); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are
categorized based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations.



In determining fair value we use observable market data when available. Additionally, we consider both counterparty credit risk and our own creditworthiness in
determining fair value. We attempt to mitigate credit risk to third parties by entering into netting and collateral arrangements. In those instances, the net exposure is then measured considering the
counterparty's creditworthiness.

The following sets forth the types of assets measured at fair value and a brief description of the valuation technique for each asset type:

Position description

Valuation Technique

Marketable securities

Initially valued at transaction price. Carrying value of cash equivalents (including money market funds) approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months.

Prepaid forward contracts

Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the market price of Target common stock.

Interest rate swaps/forward

Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation
model (

e.g.

, interest rates, credit spreads, etc.). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data. A credit risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit

Company-owned life insurance investments

Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the index fund in which the investment position is
held. The market values of these investments are determined based upon quoted market prices.

9. Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase. We
carry these investments at cost, which approximates fair value. These investments totaled $302 million and $1,851 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008,
respectively.

Also
included in cash equivalents are amounts due from credit card transactions with settlement terms of less than five days. Receivables resulting from third-party credit card sales
within our Retail Segment are included within cash equivalents and were $323 million and $400 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. Payables
resulting from the use of the Target Visa at third-party merchants are included within cash equivalents and were $53 million and $60 million at January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, respectively.

10. Credit Card Receivables

Credit card receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance, recognized in an amount equal to the
anticipated future write-offs of existing receivables, was $1,010 million at January 31, 2009 and $570 million at February 2, 2008. This allowance includes
provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends, and
industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to



accrue
finance charges until they are written off. Total accounts receivable past due ninety days or more and still accruing finance charges were $393 million at January 31, 2009 and
$235 million at February 2, 2008. Accounts are written off when they become 180 days past due.

As
a method of providing funding for our accounts receivable, we sell on an ongoing basis all of our consumer credit card receivables to Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), a wholly
owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. TRC then transfers the receivables to the Target Credit Card Master Trust (the Trust), which from time to time will sell debt securities to third parties either
directly or through a related trust. These debt securities represent undivided interests in the Trust assets. TRC uses the proceeds from the sale of debt securities and its share of collections on the
receivables to pay the purchase price of the receivables to Target.

We
consolidate the receivables within the Trust and any debt securities issued by the Trust, or a related trust, in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based upon the
applicable accounting guidance. The receivables transferred to the Trust are not available to general creditors of Target. The payments to the holders of the debt securities issued by the Trust or the
related trust are made solely from the assets transferred to the Trust or the related trust, and are nonrecourse to the general assets of Target. Upon termination of the securitization program and
repayment of all debt securities, any remaining assets could be distributed to Target in a liquidation of TRC.

In
the second quarter of 2008, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to a JPMorgan Chase affiliate (JPMC). The interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables
portfolio at the time of the transaction. This transaction was accounted for as a secured borrowing, and accordingly, the receivables within the trust and the note payable issued by the trust are
reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Notwithstanding this accounting treatment, the receivables transferred to the trust are not available to general creditors of Target,
and the payments to JPMC are made solely from the trust assets and are nonrecourse to the general assets of Target. The accounts receivable assets that collateralize the note payable supply the cash
flow to pay principal and interest to the note holder. Periodic interest payments due on the note are satisfied provided the cash flows from the trust assets are sufficient. If the cash flows are less
than the periodic interest, the available amount, if any, is paid with respect to interest. Interest shortfalls will be paid to the extent subsequent cash flows from the assets in the trust are
sufficient.

In
the event of a decrease in the receivables principal amount such that JPMC's interest in the entire portfolio would exceed 47 percent for three consecutive months, TRC (using
the cash flows from the assets in the trust) would pay JPMC a pro rata amount of principal collections such that the interest owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent. Conversely, at the
option of the Corporation, JPMC may
be required to fund an increase in the portfolio to maintain their 47 percent interest up to a maximum JPMC principal balance of $4.2 billion. If a three month average of monthly finance
charge excess (JPMC's prorata share of finance charge collections less write-offs and specified expenses) is less than 2 percent of the outstanding principal balance of JPMC's
interest, the Corporation must implement mutually agreed upon underwriting strategies. If the three month average finance charge excess falls below 1 percent of the outstanding principal
balance of JPMC's interest, JPMC may compel the Corporation to implement underwriting and collections activities, provided those activities are compatible with the Corporation's systems, as well as
consistent with similar credit card receivable portfolios managed by JPMC. If the Corporation fails to implement the activities, JPMC may cause the accelerated repayment of the note payable issued in
the transaction.

11. Inventory

Substantially all of our inventory and the related cost of sales are accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method (RIM)
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventory is stated at the lower of LIFO cost or market. Cost includes purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Inventory is
also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. The LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally measured retail price indices.

Under
RIM, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value inventory. RIM is an averaging
method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are
currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.

We
routinely enter into arrangements with certain vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Revenues under this
program are included in sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position because of the virtually



simultaneous
purchase and sale of this inventory. Sales made under these arrangements totaled $1,266 million in 2008, $1,390 million in 2007, and $1,178 million in 2006.

using available market prices in 2008 and 2007 did not materially differ from the carrying amount.

13. Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives or lease term if shorter. We amortize leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term over the shorter of
the assets' useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired. Depreciation expense for
2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1,804 million, $1,644 million and $1,509 million, respectively. For income tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are generally used. Repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and were $609 million in 2008, $592 million in 2007 and $532 million in 2006. Facility pre-opening costs, including supplies
and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

15. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded within other noncurrent assets at cost less accumulated amortization. Goodwill totaled
$60 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. An impairment loss on a



long-lived
and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset
carrying amount. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is subject to an annual impairment test. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value for the purposes of the required annual
impairment analysis.

No
material impairments were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed. Intangible assets by major classes were as follows:

cumulative benefit to amortization expense of approximately $28 million. Amortization expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $21 million, $15 million, and $(13) million,
respectively.

18. Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise
royalties, equipment purchases, marketing related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts, were approximately $570 million and $663 million at
January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. We issue inventory purchase orders, which represent authorizations



to
purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are
not firm commitments as they are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays
incurred prior to cancellation under certain circumstances.

Trade
letters of credit totaled $1,359 million and $1,861 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, a portion of which are reflected in
accounts payable. Standby letters of credit, relating primarily to retained risk on our insurance claims, totaled $64 million and $69 million at January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, respectively.

We
are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest
of our shareholders and other constituents. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe
that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We
did not issue any unsecured, long-term debt during 2008. We issued various long-term, unsecured debt instruments during 2007. Information on these transactions

As further explained in Note 10, we maintain an accounts receivable financing program through which we sell credit card receivables to a
bankruptcy remote, wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn transfers the receivables to a trust. The trust, either directly or through related trusts, sells debt securities to third parties. The
following summarizes this activity for fiscal 2007 and 2008.

Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant,
our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants.

20. Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value on the balance sheet. Our derivative instruments have been primarily
interest rate swaps. We use these derivatives to mitigate our interest rate risk.

Historically,
the majority of our derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
(SFAS 133). The changes in market value of an interest rate swap, as well as the offsetting change in market value of the hedged debt, were recognized within earnings in the current period. We
assessed at the inception of the hedge whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. Ineffectiveness resulted when changes in
the market value of the hedged debt were not completely offset by changes in the market value of the interest rate swap. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, 100 percent hedge effectiveness
was assumed for those derivatives whose terms met the conditions of the SFAS 133 "short-cut method." There was no ineffectiveness recognized in 2008, 2007 or 2006 related to our
derivative instruments. As detailed below, at January 31, 2009, we had no derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges.

During
the first quarter of 2008, we terminated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $3,125 million for cash proceeds of
$160 million, which are classified within other operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Because these swaps were designated as hedges, and concurrent with their
terminations, we were required to stop making market value adjustments to the associated hedged debt. Gains realized upon termination will be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the
associated hedge debt.



Additionally,
during 2008, we de-designated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps, and upon de-designation, these swaps no longer qualified for hedge
accounting treatment. As a result of the de-designation, the unrealized gains on these swaps determined at the date of de-designation will be amortized into earnings over the
remaining lives of the previously hedged items.

Simultaneous
to the de-designations, we entered into "pay fixed" swaps to economically hedge the risks associated with the de-designated "pay floating" swaps.
These swaps are not designated as hedging instruments and along with the de-designated "pay floating" swaps are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis. Changes in fair value
measurements are a component of net interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

amortized into earnings over the remaining lives totaled $263 million, $14 million and $19 million, at the end of 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

During 2007, we entered into a series of interest rate lock agreements that effectively fixed the interest payments on our anticipated issuance of
debt that would be affected by interest-rate fluctuations on the U.S. Treasury benchmark between the beginning date of the interest rate locks and the date of the issuance of the debt.
Upon our issuance of fixed-rate debt in fiscal 2007, we terminated these rate lock agreements with a combined notional amount of $2.5 billion for cash payment of $79 million,
which is classified within other



operating
cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The loss of $48 million, net of taxes of $31 million, has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is
being recognized as an adjustment to net interest expense over the same period in which the related interest costs on the debt are recognized in earnings. During 2007, the amount reclassified into
earnings was not material. During 2008, the amount reclassified into earnings as an increase to interest expense from accumulated other comprehensive income was $3 million ($5 million
pre tax). The amount expected to be reclassified
into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income for 2009 is expected to be $3 million ($5 million pre tax).

21. Leases

We lease certain retail locations, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, equipment and land. Assets held under capital lease
are included in property and equipment. Operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. At lease inception, we determine the lease term by
assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured because of the significant economic penalty that exists for not exercising those options. The exercise of lease renewal
options is at our sole discretion. The expected lease term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate straight-line rent expense. Additionally,
the depreciable life of buildings and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term.

Rent
expense on buildings, which is included in SG&A, includes rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels for certain stores. Total rent expense was
$169 million in 2008, $165 million in 2007 and $158 million in 2006, including percentage rent expense of $4 million in 2008 and $5 million in 2007 and 2006. Certain
leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These expenses are classified in SG&A consistent with similar costs
for owned locations. Most long-term leases include
one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to more than fifty years. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.

22. Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date. We have not recorded deferred taxes when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Such
amounts are not significant. In the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the current deferred tax asset balance is the net of all current deferred tax assets and current deferred
tax liabilities. The noncurrent deferred tax liability is the net of all noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities.

Our effective income tax rate was 37.4 percent in 2008, 38.4 percent in 2007 and 38.0 percent in 2006. The decrease in 2008
was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate is also lower due to a comparatively
greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically
hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable. The increase in the 2007 effective rate from the prior year was primarily due to lower
capital market returns on these investments as compared to 2006.

If the Corporation were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefit liabilities recorded, approximately $208 million of the
$434 million reserve would benefit the effective tax rate. In addition, the impact of penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties associated with
unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are recorded within income tax expense. During the years ended January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, we recognized
approximately $33 million, $37 million and $37 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. We had accrued for the payment of interest and penalties of approximately
$153 million at January 31, 2009 and $129 million at February 2, 2008.

Included
in the balance at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 are $116 million and $72 million, respectively, of liabilities for tax positions for which
the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the cash payment to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next
twelve months; however, we do not currently expect any change to have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position.

We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability and workers' compensation claims. Liabilities associated with
these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General
liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.

24. Share Repurchase

In November 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program totaling $10 billion that replaced a prior program.
In November 2008, we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open-market share repurchase program.

Of the shares reacquired and included above, a portion was delivered upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. The prepaid forward contracts
settled in 2008 had a total cash investment of $249 million and an aggregate market value of $251 million at their respective settlement dates. The prepaid forward contracts settled in
2007 had a total cash investment of $165 million and an aggregate market value of $215 million at their respective settlement dates. The prepaid forward contracts settled in 2006 had a
total cash investment of $76 million and an aggregate market value of $88 million at their respective settlement dates. These contracts are among the investment vehicles used to reduce
our economic exposure related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The details of our positions in prepaid forward contracts have been provided in Note 26.

Our
share repurchases during 2008 included 30 million shares that were acquired through the exercise of call options.

25. Share-Based Compensation

We maintain a long-term incentive plan for key team members and non-employee members of our Board of Directors.
Our long-term incentive plan allows us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share unit awards, restricted stock unit
awards, or a combination of awards. A majority of granted awards are nonqualified stock options that vest annually in equal amounts over a four-year period and expire no later than
10 years after the grant date. Options granted to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors become exercisable after one year and have a 10-year term. We have
issued performance share unit awards annually since January 2003. These awards represent shares potentially issuable in the future based upon the attainment of compound annual growth rates in revenue
and EPS as set forth in the performance criteria. In 2006 and 2008, we issued restricted stock units with three-year cliff vesting to select team members. We also regularly issue
restricted stock units to our Board of Directors. Restricted stock units granted in 2008 have one-year graded vesting. The number of unissued



common
shares reserved for future grants under the share-based compensation plans was 25,755,800 at January 31, 2009 and 36,190,569 at February 2, 2008.

We used a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at grant date based on the assumptions noted in the following
table. Volatility represents an average of market quotes for implied volatility of 5.5-year options on Target common stock. The expected life is estimated based on an analysis of options
already exercised and any foreseeable trends or changes in recipients' behavior. The risk-free interest rate is an interpolation of the relevant U.S. Treasury security maturities as of
each applicable grant date. The assumptions disclosed below represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for all of our stock option grants throughout the years.

Total share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $72 million, $73 million, and
$99 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The related income tax benefit was $28 million, $28 million, and $39 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

At January 31, 2009, there was $173 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options. That cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. The weighted average remaining life of currently exercisable options is 4.8 years, and the weighted average
remaining life of all outstanding options is 6.8 years. The total fair value of options vested was $51 million, $35 million, and $47 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively.

Performance
share unit award recipients will receive shares of common stock if certain revenue and EPS growth targets are met and the recipients also satisfy service-based vesting
requirements. Compensation expense associated with outstanding performance share units is recorded over the life of the awards. The expense recorded each period is dependent upon our estimate of the
number of shares that will ultimately be issued and, for some awards, the current Target common stock price. Future compensation expense for currently outstanding awards could reach a maximum of
$57 million assuming payout of all outstanding awards. The total share based liabilities paid were $15 million and $18 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were no share
based liabilities paid in 2006.

In
2008, we recorded a $12 million reversal of previously recorded expense related to performance share units that were to be paid to award recipients at the end of the fiscal
year. The related performance share units will not be delivered to award recipients because we did not meet certain revenue and EPS compound annual growth rates as set forth in the performance
criteria.

Total
unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards was $14 million as of January 31, 2009.

26. Defined Contribution Plans

Team members who meet certain eligibility requirements can participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan by investing up to
80 percent of their compensation, as limited by statute or regulation. Generally, we match 100 percent of each team member's contribution up to 5 percent of total compensation.
Our contribution to the plan is initially invested in Target common stock. These amounts are free to be diversified by the team member immediately.

In
addition, we maintain nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans for approximately 4,000 current and retired team members whose participation in our 401(k) plan is limited by
statute or regulation. These team members choose from a menu of crediting rate alternatives that are the same as the investment choices in our 401(k) plan, including Target common stock. We credit an
additional 2 percent per year to the accounts of all active participants, excluding executive officer participants, in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation in a plan of
this nature. We also maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan that was frozen during 1996, covering 11 active and 52 retired participants. In this plan deferred compensation earns
returns tied to market levels of interest rates, plus an additional 6 percent return, with a minimum of 12 percent and a maximum of 20 percent, as determined by the plan's terms.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 added Section 409A to the Internal Revenue Code, changing the federal income tax treatment of nonqualified deferred compensation
arrangements. Failure to comply with the new requirements would result in early taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, as well as a 20 percent penalty tax and additional
interest payable to the IRS. In response to these new requirements, we allowed participants to elect to accelerate the distribution dates for their account balances. Participant elections resulted in
payments of $86 million in 2008 and $74 million in 2007.

We
control some of our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through investing in vehicles, including prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock, that offset a substantial
portion of our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These investment vehicles are general corporate assets and are marked-to-market with the related gains and
losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur. The total change in fair value for contracts indexed to our own common stock recorded in earnings was
pre-tax income/(loss) of $(19) million in 2008, $6 million in 2007 and $37 million in 2006. During 2008 and 2007, we invested approximately $215 million and
$164 million, respectively, in such investment instruments, and these investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within other investing activities. Adjusting our
position in these investment vehicles may involve repurchasing shares of Target common stock when settling the forward contracts. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, these



repurchases
totaled 4.7 million, 3.4 million and 1.6 million shares, respectively, and are included in the total share repurchases described in Note 24.

27. Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans

We have qualified defined benefit pension plans covering all U.S. team members who meet age and service requirements, including in
certain circumstances date of hire. We also have unfunded nonqualified pension plans for team members with qualified plan compensation restrictions. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits
varies depending on team members' date of hire, length of service and/or team member compensation. Upon retirement, team members also become eligible for certain health care benefits if they meet
minimum age and service requirements and agree to contribute a portion of the cost.

SFAS
No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)"
(SFAS 158) requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively postretirement benefit plans) to recognize the funded status of their
postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year-end statement of
financial position and provide additional disclosures.

At
the beginning of fiscal 2007, we early adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 which require us to measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as
of the date of the year-end statement of financial position. Before 2007, we measured our pension and postretirement benefit obligations at the end of October each year. As a result, we
recorded a $16 million decrease to retained earnings, a $54 million increase to accumulated other comprehensive income, a $65 million increase to other noncurrent assets, a
$3 million increase to other noncurrent liabilities, and a $24 million decrease to deferred income taxes. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 had no effect
on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at February 4, 2007 or any prior periods.



We
adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 on February 3, 2007, which require us to recognize the funded status, which is the difference between the
fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations, of our postretirement benefit plans in the February 3, 2007 Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding
adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized
prior service costs. The adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS 158 had no effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations at February 3, 2007 or any prior periods.

The
following table provides a summary of the changes in the benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Statement of

The discount rate used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year is the rate as of the beginning of the year
(

i.e

., the prior measurement date). With an essentially stable asset allocation over the following time periods, our annualized rate of return on
qualified plans' assets has averaged 6.3 percent, 5.7 percent and 8.8 percent for the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year periods, respectively, ended
January 31, 2009.

An
increase in the cost of covered health care benefits of 9 percent was assumed for 2008. In 2009, the rate is assumed to be 8 percent for non-Medicare
eligible individuals and 9 percent for Medicare eligible individuals. Both rates will be reduced to 5 percent in 2013 and thereafter.

A
one percent change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects at January 31, 2009:

Other assets include private equity, mezzanine and distressed debt, a balanced portfolio of global equities and global fixed income securities, timber-related assets, and a
5 percent allocation to real estate.

Our asset allocation strategy targets 32 percent in domestic equity securities, 18 percent in international equity securities,
23 percent in high quality, long-duration debt securities, including interest rate swaps, and 27 percent in alternative assets. Equity securities include our common stock in
amounts substantially less than 1 percent of total plan assets as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. Our expected annualized long-term rate of return
assumptions as of January 31, 2009 were 8.5 percent for domestic and international equity securities, 5.5 percent for long-duration debt securities, and 9.5 percent for
other assets.

Contributions

We are not required to make any contributions in 2009, although we may choose to make discretionary contributions of up to
$100 million. We expect to make contributions in the range of $5 million to $15 million to our postretirement health care benefit plan in 2009.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Benefit payments by the plans, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

28. Segment Reporting

Prior to 2008, we operated as a single business segment. During the first quarter of 2008 our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Robert
Ulrich, who was our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as defined in SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" (SFAS 131), retired, and he was
succeeded by Gregg Steinhafel. As a result of this change and in light of the anticipated sale of an undivided interest in approximately one-half of our credit card receivables, we
reevaluated the provisions of SFAS 131. Based upon our review performed in the first quarter of 2008, we determined that we have two reportable segments, which reflects how our new CODM reviews
our results in terms of allocating resources and assessing performance. These two reportable segments are based on our different products and services: Retail and Credit Card. As a result, prior
period disclosures reflect the change in reportable segments.



Our
measure of profit for each segment is a measure that management considers analytically useful in measuring the return we are achieving on our investment.

New account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales. Our Retail Segment charges the cost of these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the
reimbursements
of $117 million in 2008, $114 million in 2007 and $109 million in 2006 are recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses within the Retail Segment and an increase to operations and
marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.

29. Quarterly Results (Unaudited)

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, fourth quarter operating results typically represent a substantially larger share of total
year revenues and earnings because they include our peak sales period from Thanksgiving through the end of December. We follow the same accounting policies for preparing quarterly and annual financial
data. The table below summarizes quarterly results for 2008 and 2007:

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not applicable

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the
participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

For
the Report of Management on Internal Control and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, see Item 8,
