PART I

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In this Report on Form 10-K
(including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations incorporated into Item 7 hereof), Management discusses expectations regarding future performance of the
Company which may include anticipated financial performance, business prospects, prospects for international growth, investments in the sales and service force, the impact of legislation and
environmental compliance, the effect of litigation, production capability, share repurchases, the effect of new accounting pronouncements and similar matters. Without limiting the foregoing, words or
phrases such as "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "we believe," "estimate," "project" (including the negative or variations thereof) or similar terminology,
generally identify forward-looking statements. Additionally, the company may refer to this section of the Form 10-K to identify risk factors related to other forward looking
statements made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public.

Forward-looking
statements represent challenging goals for the Company. As such, they are based on certain assumptions and estimates and are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties. The Company
cautions that undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date made. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company hereby
identifies important factors which could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or
other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors should be considered, together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language which may be made in the section
of this Report on Form 10-K containing the forward-looking statement.

Risks
and uncertainties that may affect operating results and business performance include: restraints on pricing flexibility due to competitive factors and customer consolidations;
cost increases due to higher oil prices or unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials; the occurrence of capacity constraints, or the loss of a key supplier, which in either case
limit the production of certain products; the effect of future acquisitions or divestitures or other corporate transactions, as well as our ability to achieve plans for past acquisitions, including
difficulties in rationalizing acquired businesses and in realizing related cost savings and other benefits; market or regulatory factors which could affect the Company's ability to reacquire shares;
the costs and effects


of complying with: (i) the significant environmental laws and regulations which apply to the Company's operations and facilities, (ii) government regulations relating to the manufacture,
storage, distribution and labeling of the Company's products and (iii) changes in tax, fiscal, governmental and other regulatory policies; economic factors such as the worldwide economy,
interest rates, currency movements, euro conversion and the development of markets; the occurrence of (i) litigation or claims, (ii) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or
distributor, (iii) natural or manmade disasters and (iv) severe weather conditions affecting the food service and the hospitality industry; loss of, or changes in, executive management;
the Company's ability to continue product introductions and technological innovations; and other uncertainties or risks reported from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In addition, the Company notes that its stock price can be affected by fluctuations in quarterly earnings. Despite favorable year over year quarterly comparisons in recent years,
there can be no assurances that earnings will continue to increase or that the degree of improvement will meet investors' expectations.

Item 1.  Business

Item 1(a)  General Development of Business

Except where the context otherwise requires, the terms "Company" and "Ecolab," as used herein, include Ecolab Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Ecolab Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1924. The Company's fiscal year is the calendar year ending December 31.

The
Company and Henkel KGaA of Düsseldorf, Germany ("Henkel"), each have a 50% economic interest in a joint venture which operates institutional and industrial cleaning
and sanitizing businesses in Europe, and which is referred to hereafter as "Henkel-Ecolab." Strategic decisions concerning Henkel-Ecolab require the agreement of Henkel and the Company. Henkel has a
tie-breaking vote on certain matters pertaining to continuation of business in the event mutual agreement is not reached. These include the appointment of Henkel-Ecolab senior executives
and adoption of the annual business plan. The Company accounts for its interest in Henkel-Ecolab under the equity method of accounting and therefore does not consolidate the Henkel-Ecolab balance
sheet accounts, revenues and expenses or cash flows. Financial statements of Henkel-Ecolab, as listed under Item 14.I(3). of Part IV hereof, are included as a part of this Report and a review
of Henkel-Ecolab financial performance is found under the heading "Henkel-Ecolab" contained in the Financial Discussion which is incorporated from the Annual Report into Item 7 hereof. Except where
Henkel-Ecolab is specifically referred to, the description of business in Part I does not include the business of Henkel-Ecolab.

On
December 7, 2000, the Company announced that it has agreed to combine into its operations the 50% of the Henkel-Ecolab joint venture owned by Henkel. The transaction is
scheduled to close January 2, 2002, subject to regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions. Following the closing of the transaction, the Company anticipates operating the business conducted
by Henkel-Ecolab as a part of the Company's consolidated business operations.

During
2000, the Company continued to make business acquisitions which broadened its product and service offerings in line with its "Circle the Customer—Circle the Globe"
strategy. In February 2000, the Company added to its Kay operations through the acquisition of Southwest Sanitary Distributing Company. In addition, the Company expanded the geographic coverage
of its GCS commercial kitchen equipment parts and repair business with the acquisitions of ARR/CRS (June 2000), Stove Parts Supply (August 2000) and Peterson's Commercial Parts &
Service (November


2000). In September 2000 the Company purchased Facilitec Corp. to introduce rooftop grease filter products and kitchen exhaust cleaning services to its Institutional operations. Outside the
United States, the Company expanded its institutional cleaning and sanitizing operations in Latin America and Korea through acquisitions. Details of these acquisitions are found under the heading
"Business Acquisitions and Divestitures" in Note 5, located on pages 39 and 40 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 8 hereof. During 2000, the Company divested Jackson MSC, which
designed, manufactured and
marketed dishwashing and customized machines for the food service industry. The purchaser of Jackson MSC will continue to supply dishmachines to the Company under a long-term supply
arrangement.

Item 1(b)  Financial Information About Operating Segments

The financial information about reportable segments appearing under the heading "Operating Segments" in Note 16, located on pages 46 and 47 of the
Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1(c)  Narrative Description of Business

General:

The Company is engaged in the development and marketing of premium products and services for the hospitality,
institutional and industrial markets. The Company provides cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products, systems and services primarily to hotels and restaurants,
foodservice, healthcare and educational facilities, quick-service (fastfood and other convenience store) units, grocery stores, commercial and institutional laundries, light industry, dairy plants and
farms, food and beverage processors, pharmaceutical and cosmetics facilities and the vehicle wash industry. A strong commitment to customer support is a distinguishing characteristic of the Company.
Additional information on the Company's business philosophy is found below under the heading "Additional Information—Competition" of this Item 1(c).

The
following description of business is based upon the Company's three reportable segments ("segments") as reported in the Company's financial statements. However, the Company
pursues a "Circle the Customer—Circle the Globe" strategy by providing products, systems and services which serve the Company's customer base, and does so on a global basis to meet the
needs of its customer's various operations around the world. Therefore, one customer may utilize the services of all three of the segments. Thus, there is a degree of interdependence among the
operating segments—particularly between the International Cleaning & Sanitizing and the United States Cleaning & Sanitizing businesses.

United States Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment

The "United States Cleaning & Sanitizing" segment is comprised of seven divisions which provide cleaning and sanitizing services to United States
markets.

Institutional:

The Institutional Division is the Company's largest division and sells specialized cleaners and
sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment ("warewashing"), for on-premise laundries (typically used by customers having smaller
machines and laundry needs) and for general housekeeping functions, as well as dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries and
water filters to the foodservice industry. The Division also provides rooftop grease filter products and kitchen exhaust cleaning services for restaurants and other food service operations as well as
pool and spa treatment programs for commercial and hospitality customers. The Institutional


Division also markets various chemical dispensing device systems, which are made available to customers, to dispense the Company's cleaners and sanitizers. The Institutional Division also markets,
primarily to smaller and mid-size customer units, a program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine
maintenance.

The
Company believes it is the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products to institutions in the United States.

The
Institutional Division sells its products and services primarily through Company-employed field sales and service personnel. However, the Company, to a significant degree, also
utilizes independent, third-party foodservice distributors to market and sell its products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors and the Company provides the same
service to accounts served by food distributors as to direct customers.

Kay:

The Kay Division (which consists of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company) supplies chemical cleaning
and sanitizing products primarily to the quick-service restaurant industry. This includes traditional fast food restaurants but also other retail locations where "fast food" is prepared and served,
such as convenience stores, airport and shopping center kiosks and other public venues typically serviced by national or regional restaurant chains. Kay also sells cleaning and sanitizing products, as
well as remote monitoring services, to the food retail (i.e., grocery store) industry. Kay's products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes,
hand care products and assorted cleaning tools and remote monitoring technology for refrigerators, freezers and cooking equipment. Products are sold under the "Kay" brand or the customer's private
label. In addition, Kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers. Kay's customized cleaning and sanitation
programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels, cleaning performance, equipment life and safety levels.

Kay
employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quick-service restaurant chains and franchisees, although the sales are made to distributors
who supply the chain or franchisee's restaurants.

The
Company believes that its Kay Division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick-service restaurant industry in the United
States. While Kay's customer base has been growing, Kay's business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quick-service restaurant chains and franchisees.

Food & Beverage:

The Food & Beverage Division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the start of the food
chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption. The Division provides detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as well as cleaning systems,
electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products, primarily to dairy plants, dairy farms, breweries, soft-drink bottling plants, and meat, poultry and
other food processors as well as to pharmaceutical and cosmetic plants. The division also markets food irradiation services through an alliance with Ion Beam Applications (IBA). The Food &
Beverage Division also designs, engineers and installs CIP ("clean-in-place") process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base. Farm products are
sold through dealers


and independent, third-party distributors, while plant products are sold primarily by the Company's field sales personnel. The Company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and
sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy farm and beverage processor industries in the United States.

Textile Care:

The Textile Care Division provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems, as well
as related services, to large institutional and commercial laundries and to certain smaller laundry operations. Typically these customers process a minimum of 1,000,000 pounds of linen each year and
include free-standing laundry plants used by institutions such as hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities as well as industrial, textile rental and shirt laundries. Products and
services include laundry cleaning and specialty products and related dispensing equipment, which are marketed primarily through a Company-employed sales force and, to a lesser extent, through
independent, third-party distributors. The Division's programs are designed to meet the customer's need for exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the customer's
overall operating cost. Textile Care offerings complement the Institutional Division's offerings to small-to-medium size on-premise laundry facilities. During 2000
the Textile Care Division also introduced a hand care program for commercial laundries.

Professional Products:

The Professional Products Division provides a broad range of janitorial and infection
prevention/health care offerings to the janitorial and medical markets in the United States. Its proprietary janitorial products (detergents, general purpose cleaners, carpet care, furniture polishes,
disinfectants, floor care products, hand soaps and odor counteractants) are sold primarily under the brand name "Airkem," and proprietary infection prevention/health care products (skin care,
disinfectants and instrument sterilants) are sold primarily under the "Huntington" brand name. These products are sold primarily through a network of independent, third-party distributors, supported
by a Company-employed sales force.

The
Division also sells certain specialty chemical products which are manufactured for third parties. These offerings include the manufacture of private label products and house brand
products for third parties. They also include, through the Division's JaniSource operations, cleaning and sanitation products for the janitorial market, which are sold under brand names which are
licensed for use from other companies. JaniSource products are sold through independent, third-party distributors.

Vehicle Care:

The Company's Vehicle Care Division provides vehicle appearance products which include soaps, polishes,
wheel and tire treatments and air fresheners. Products are sold to vehicle rental, fleet and consumer car wash and detail operations.

Water Care Services:

The Water Care Services Division supplements the Company's "Circle the Customer—Circle
the Globe" strategy by adding an offering which is critical to companies in the Company's customer base—water treatment programs. The Division provides water and wastewater treatment
products, services and systems for commercial/institutional customers (hospitals, healthcare, commercial real estate, government, shopping malls and commercial laundries) and light industry (food and
beverage accounts, textile mills, electronic parts/assembly plants and other industries). Water Care Services works closely with the Company's Institutional, Textile Care and Food & Beverage
divisions to offer customized water care strategies to their accounts that have water care needs, primarily to treat water used in heating and cooling systems and manufacturing processes and to treat
wastewater.


United States Other Services Segment

The "United States Other Services" segment is comprised of two business units: Pest Elimination and GCS Service. In general, both businesses provide service or
equipment which can augment or extend
the Company's product offering to its business customers as a part of the "Circle the Customer" approach.

Pest Elimination:

The Pest Elimination Division provides services for the elimination and prevention of pests to
restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick-service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers. These
services are sold and performed by Company-employed sales and service personnel. The Pest Elimination business acquires all of its insecticides and pesticides from third-party vendors.

GCS Service:

GCS (which operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) provides commercial kitchen parts and
equipment repair services including parts distribution. GCS offers both chain account customers of the Company and equipment manufacturers the benefits of working with a single equipment repair
service provider with a nationally based capability.

International Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment

The Company conducts business in approximately 40 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in the case of China, Israel and
Venezuela, through majority-owned joint ventures with local partners. In other countries, selected products are sold by the Company's export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although
those sales are not significant in terms of the Company's overall sales. The largest International operations are located in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada with smaller operations in Africa.
With limited exceptions, the Company does not currently conduct business directly in Europe. In that region, business is conducted by Henkel-Ecolab which is described in Item 1(a) hereof under
the heading "General Development of Business."

In
general, the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the United States. The businesses which are similar to the United States' Institutional and
Food & Beverage businesses, are the largest businesses in international operations. They are conducted at virtually all international locations, and compared to the United States, constitute a
larger portion of the overall business. Kay has sales in a number of international locations. A significant portion of its international sales are to non-United States units of United
States-based quick-service restaurant chains. Consequently, a substantial portion of Kay's international sales are made either to domestic or internationally-located independent, third-party
distributors who serve these chains. The other businesses are conducted less extensively in international locations. However, in general, all of the businesses conducted in the United States are
operated in Canada.

International
businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, tax laws, currency exchange rates and
economic and political conditions abroad. The profitability of International operations is lower than the profitability of businesses in the United States. This is due to lower International operating
income margins caused by the difference in scale of International operations where operating locations are


smaller in size as well as to the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions. Proportionately larger investments in sales, administrative and technical personnel are
also necessary in order to facilitate growth in International operations.

Additional Information

Competition:

The Company's business units have two significant classes of competitors. First, each business unit
competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Some of these large competitors have substantially greater assets and
financial resources than the Company. Second, all of the Company's business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or
end-user segments.

The
Company's objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of its business markets. In general, competition is based on service, product performance and price. The Company
believes it competes principally by providing superior value and differentiated products. Value is provided by state-of-the-art cleaning, sanitation and maintenance
products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and dedication to customer satisfaction after the initial sale. This is made possible, in part, by the Company's significant
on-going investment in training and technology development and by the Company's standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and comply with safety,
environmental and sanitation regulations. In addition, the Company emphasizes its ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services to its customers and to
provide that level of service to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide. This approach is succinctly stated in the Company's "Circle the Customer—Circle the Globe"
strategy which is discussed above in this Item 1(c) under the heading "General."

Sales and Service:

Products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by
Company-trained sales and service personnel who also advise and assist customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and
sanitation needs. Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets, as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments
above.

Customers and Classes of Service:

The Company believes that its business is not materially dependent upon a single
customer although, as described above in this Item 1(c) under the description of the Kay business, Kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick-service chains and
franchisees. Additionally, although the Company has a diverse customer base, and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of the Company's consolidated revenues, the Company
does have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods. No material part of the
Company's business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit. The Company sells two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of its
sales. Worldwide sales of warewashing products in 2000, 1999 and 1998 approximated 26, 27 and 28 percent, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales. In addition, the Company,
through its Institutional and Textile Care businesses, sells laundry products and services to a broad range of laundry customers. Worldwide laundry sales in 2000, 1999 and 1998 approximated 11, 12 and
13 percent, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales.


Patents and Trademarks:

The Company owns a number of patents and trademarks. While the Company has an active program to
protect its intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks, and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, Management does not believe that the Company's overall
business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.

Seasonality:

The Company's business has little seasonality.

Working Capital:

The Company has invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in merchandising
equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense the Company's cleaning and sanitizing products. The Company, otherwise, has no unusual working capital requirements. The
investment in merchandising equipment is discussed under the heading "Cash Flows" located on page 33 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 7 hereof.

Manufacturing and Distribution:

The Company manufactures most of its products and related equipment in Company-owned
manufacturing facilities. Some are also produced for the Company by third-party contract manufacturers. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on
product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and
additional information on the Company's manufacturing facilities is located in Item 2 under the heading "Properties" on pages 15 and 16 hereof.

Deliveries
to customers are made from the Company's manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses. The Company uses common carriers, its own
delivery vehicles and distributors. Additional information on the Company's plant and distribution facilities is located in Item 2 under the heading "Properties" on pages 15 and 16
hereof.

Raw Materials:

Raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing products for the Company are inorganic chemicals,
including phosphates, silicates, alkalies, salts and organic chemicals, including surfactants and solvents. These materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of
chemical manufacturers. Pesticides used by the Pest Elimination Division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. The Company also
purchases packaging materials for its manufactured products and components for its specialized cleaning equipment and systems. Most raw materials, or substitutes for those materials, used by the
Company, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which the Company manufactures, are available from several suppliers.

Research and Development:

The Company's research and development program consists principally of devising and testing
new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products. Key
disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of the Company's principal products have
been developed by its research, development and engineering personnel. At times, technology may be licensed from outside the Company to develop offerings. Note 13, entitled "Research
Expenditures" located on page 44 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.

Environmental Considerations:

This discussion of Environmental Considerations should be read in light of the
Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors discussion found under Part I at the beginning of this Report. The Company's businesses are subject to various legislative enactments


and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. While the Company cooperates with governmental authorities and takes commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements
and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in the Company's businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with managing hazardous substances, waste disposal or plant site
clean-up, fines and penalties if the Company were found in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations.
Additionally, although the Company is
not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations,
financial condition or liquidity. Environmental matters most significant to the Company are discussed below.

Ingredient Legislation:

Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of
products which contain phosphorous or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, label disclosures are required for certain products containing
chemicals listed by California. To date, the Company has been able to comply with such legislative requirements and, in the case of phosphate regulation, has where necessary, developed products which
contain no phosphorous or lower amounts of phosphorous. Such legislation has not had a material negative effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity to date.

Pesticide Legislation:

Various federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. The
Company manufactures and sells certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on environmental surfaces. Such products constitute "pesticides" or
"antimicrobial pesticides" under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act ("FIFRA"), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal
federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. The Company maintains approximately 375 product registrations with the United States Environmental Protection
Agency ("EPA"). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay initial and on-going registration fees. In addition, each state
in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California does
have its own regulatory scheme and certain other states have regulatory schemes under consideration. In addition, California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that State. While the cost of
complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, liquidity or the results of its operations to date, the costs and delays in receiving
necessary approvals for these products have increased in recent years. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations, and for the California tax, were
approximately $2,300,000 in 2000. Such costs will likely increase in 2001, but, based on the Company's best information, not in amounts which are expected to significantly affect the Company's results
of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In
September 2000, Region 5 of the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("U.S. EPA") initiated an administrative proceeding alleging that three products had
been sold by the Company without registering the products as antimicrobial pesticides. U.S. EPA seeks an administrative penalty of $542,850. The Company


has suspended sales of the relevant products. The Company anticipates that this matter will not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In
addition, the Company's Pest Elimination Division applies restricted-use pesticides which it purchases from third parties. That Division must comply with certain
standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in
conformity with federal regulations. The Company has not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements.

Other Environmental Legislation:

The Company's manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and
regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to the
Company's activities are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"). The Company is also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of toxic substances into the air, land and water. The Company makes capital investments and expenditures to comply with
environmental laws and regulations, to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect
on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The Company's capital expenditures for environmental control projects incurred for 2000 were approximately $2,200,000 and
approximately $2,700,000 has been budgeted for 2001.

Environmental Remediation and Proceedings:

Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties ("PRPs"), the Company is currently
involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") or state equivalents at
approximately 20 sites. In general, under CERCLA, the Company and each other PRP which actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs
associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.

Based
on an analysis of the Company's experience with such environmental proceedings, the Company's estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the 20 sites
referred to in the preceding paragraph, and the Company's estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which the Company believes have the financial ability to pay their shares, the Company
has accrued its best estimate of the Company's probable future costs relating to such known sites.

During
2000, the Company's net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $1,550,000. The accrual at December 31, 2000 for probable future remediation
expenditures was approximately $2,900,000. The Company reviews its exposure for contamination remediation costs
periodically and its accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. In establishing accruals, potential insurance


reimbursements are not included. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial
results in a future reporting period, the Company believes the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or
liquidity. In addition, the Company has retained responsibility for certain sites where the Company's former ChemLawn business is a PRP. Currently there are eight such locations and, at each, ChemLawn
is a

Item 2. Properties

The Company's manufacturing facilities produce chemical products or equipment for all the Company's businesses, although the Pest Elimination Division, GCS and
the Facilitec business purchase most of their products and equipment from outside suppliers. The Company's chemical production process consists primarily of blending and packaging powders and liquids
and casting solids. The Company's equipment manufacturing operations consist primarily of producing chemical product dispensers and ejectors and other mechanical equipment (South Beloit, Illinois) and
dishwasher racks and related sundries (Elk Grove Village, Illinois). The Company's philosophy is to manufacture products wherever an economic, process or quality assurance advantage exists or where
proprietary manufacturing techniques dictate internal production processes. Currently, most products sold by the Company are manufactured at Company facilities.

The
following chart profiles the Company's manufacturing facilities which are approximately 50,000 square feet or larger in size.

In
general, manufacturing facilities located in the United States serve the "United States Cleaning & Sanitizing" segment and facilities located outside of the United States
serve the "International Cleaning & Sanitizing" segment. However, certain of the United States facilities do manufacture products for export and which are used by the International segment. The
facilities having export involvement are marked with an asterisk(*).

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Proceedings arising under laws relating to protection of the environment are discussed at Item 1(c) above, under the heading "Environmental Considerations."


Distributor Litigation:

As previously reported in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1999, ten distributors of the Company's Airkem Janitorial product line (a unit of the Professional Products Division) brought action in 1995 against the Company in Hennepin County
District Court, Minnesota alleging 16 causes of action including anti-trust violations, breach of contract and breach of the Minnesota Franchise Act. As also reported in the
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company reached settlement with eight of the distributors on a basis which was
not adversely material to the Company and a $29,000 judgment was entered against the Company following a trial on one other case.

The
single remaining distributor case was settled during 2000 on terms which were not material to the Company.

Lubricant Litigation:

Diversey Lever, Inc. filed suit against the Company in Federal District Court, Eastern
District of Michigan, Southern Division on July 1, 1996. The suit alleges that two Company products, which lubricate plastic beverage bottles, infringe two patents held by Diversey Lever.

In
1998 the District Court found that the Company had infringed the two patents held by Diversey Lever. In 1999, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Company on its
appeal.

The
case has been remanded back to the District Court for a trial on past damages. A trial date has not been set. Diversey-Lever has requested damages for the infringement in a range
of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 and is requesting that damages be enhanced up to three times if willful infringement is found. Diversey-Lever has requested additional damages based on new theories. The
Company has filed a motion to strike such new damage theories, but no ruling has been made on that motion.

The
Company has accrued its best estimate of its potential liability.

Other Litigation:

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in various other lawsuits and claims
arising out of the normal course of business. Accruals have been established reflecting management's best estimate of probable future costs relating to such matters.

The
estimated effects of the future results of existing litigation is subject to certain estimates, assumptions and uncertainties and should be considered in light of the discussion
of Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors found under Part I at the beginning of this Report.

Report of Independent Accountants

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Henkel-Ecolab

In
our opinion, the combined financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 14.I(3). of this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Henkel-Ecolab at November 30, 2000 and 1999 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2000
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
14.I(4). of this Form 10-K presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related combined financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Henkel-Ecolab's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Henkel-Ecolab (the "Company" or the "Joint Venture") is a leading European company providing total cleaning and hygiene systems and service solutions to
institutional and industrial companies. See Basis of Presentation within Note 2 of the combined financial statements. The Company's offerings include detergents, sanitation cleaners, dosing and
measuring equipment, cleaning machines, training and service. Customers include hotels and restaurants; food service, healthcare and educational facilities; commercial laundries; light industry; dairy
plants and farms as well as food and beverage processors throughout Europe.

The
Company was formed in 1991 by Henkel KGaA (Henkel) and Ecolab, Inc. (Ecolab) as a joint venture of their respective European institutional and industrial hygiene
businesses. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement dated June 26, 1991 (Joint Venture Agreement), Henkel and Ecolab have joint control over the activities of the
Joint Venture. The Joint Venture Agreement also provides that both partners will share an equal economic interest in the profits or losses of the Joint Venture.

Acquisitions and Divestiture

Gibson
Acquisition:  In May 1999, the Company acquired certain assets of Gibson UK Limited for a cash price of approximately TDM 16,089 from Ecolab.
Gibson, located in Reading, England, provides warewashing and surface hygiene products and services for customers in the retail markets. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and,
accordingly, the results of operations of Gibson are included in the accompanying financial statements since the date of acquisition. The purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill in the amount of
TDM 17,658 and is being amortized over 15 years.

Darenas
Acquisition:  In February 1998, the Company acquired certain assets of ISS-Darenas Limited (Darenas) for a cash price of TDM 23,334.
Darenas, located in Birmingham, England, provides janitorial products and services for contract and building cleaning as well as the catering industries. The acquisition of Darenas was recorded under
the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the
results of operations of Darenas for the period from February 1, 1998 are included in the accompanying financial statements. The purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over fair value of the assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill in the amount of
TDM 17,302 and is being amortized over 15 years.

The
Company made additional acquisitions during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998; the impact of which was immaterial to the combined financial
statements.


Waldhausen Divestiture:

In June 2000, the Company divested the assets of the Floordress textile and equipment
production facility in Waldhausen, Germany in two separate but related transactions for a price equal to the net book value of approximately TDM 4.400. Inno Concept, a current supplier of
plastics to the plant, assumed responsibility of the textile and equipment production (including substantially all the employees and the current production building for textiles). The Company also
entered into a long-term supply agreement for textiles and equipment with Inno Concept. Grupp, a current metal supplier, purchased the equipment production building in a
real-estate transaction. As both transactions were for a price equal to the net book value, no gain or loss was recorded on the books for the sale of the assets related to Waldhausen.


2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements are presented on a combined basis in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Joint
Venture is comprised of various entities. These entities have varying legal structures, including stock corporations, limited liability corporations and partnerships formed under the applicable laws
in the jurisdictions in which the Joint Venture operates. These entities are owned beneficially by identical shareholders or their wholly- owned subsidiaries and are, therefore, considered entities
under common control. All significant intergroup or affiliated
company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in combination. The Joint Venture's fiscal year end has been designated as November 30.

Foreign Currency Translation

The accounts of all foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency, except for three countries
where, due to hyperinflation, the functional currency (for one country since 1994 and two beginning in 1998) has been changed to the German Mark. With the exception of the hyperinflation countries,
assets and liabilities are translated into German Marks, the Company's reporting currency, at period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated to German Marks at the
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

Net
unrealized exchange gains or losses resulting from such translation are excluded from net earnings and accumulated in a separate component of combined equity. Gains and losses
arising from foreign currency transactions during the year are included in the related income statement category.

The
Joint Venture enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and
recognized as part of the specific transaction hedged or included in Other Expenses/Income, net, principally interest expense. The cash flows from such contracts are classified in the same category as
the transaction hedged in the Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first-in first-out and average cost methods.


Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost. Merchandising equipment consists primarily of various systems for dispensing cleaning and
sanitizing products. Depreciation and amortization are charged to operations using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings and improvements

up to 50 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 10 years

Furniture, fixtures and merchandising equipment

3 to 8 years

Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period, which is the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the associated
lease. Betterment, renewals and extraordinary repairs that extend the life of the asset are capitalized; other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed. The cost and accumulated
depreciation/amortization applicable to the assets retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the Company's net income in the year of disposal.

Total
depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment amounted to TDM 69,926, TDM 565,083 and TDM 60,948 for the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets primarily consist of goodwill, capitalized software, concessions and licenses. These assets are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated lives, periods from 3 to 15 years. Total amortization expense for all intangible assets amounted to TDM 16,125, TDM 22,603 and TDM 13,586 during
the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999, 1998, respectively.

In
accordance with SOP 98-1, the Company capitalizes costs associated with purchased software for internal use which is ready for service and external development costs
incurred from the time technological feasibility of the software is established until the software is ready for use to provide processing for internal purposes.

The
software development costs and costs of purchased software are amortized using the straight-line method over a maximum of three to five years or the expected life of
the product, whichever is less. The carrying value of a software and development asset is regularly reviewed by the Company and a loss is recognized if the unamortized cost is in excess of the net
realizable value.

Long-Lived Assets

The company periodically assesses the recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets based on anticipated future earnings and operating cash
flows.


Advertising Costs

The Company expenses the production costs of advertising in the period in which the costs are incurred. Advertising expenses were TDM 41,255,
TDM 38,504 and TDM 35,696 for the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from
those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements

On June 16, 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those instruments at fair value.

If
certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an
unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a
foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, and available-for-sale security, or a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction.

Management
will adopt FAS 133 in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended November 30, 2001 and expects the impact on the combined financial statements to be
immaterial.

Revenue Recognition

Substantially all revenue is recognized at the time title transfers to the customer or distributor.

Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net
income or combined equity.

4.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Joint Venture has entered into various contractual arrangements, including those discussed in the following paragraphs, for the supply of products, the
performance of general and administrative services and the transfer of technology.

Certain
Joint Venture entities purchase institutional and industrial hygiene products (primarily finished goods inventories) from Henkel and its subsidiaries under a variety of supply
agreements. The terms of these agreements allow these entities to purchase specified quantities at agreed upon prices as defined by an annual supply plan submitted to the related manufacturing
facility. Henkel also provides certain Joint Venture entities with elective services, which include, but are not limited to, general administration, payroll administration, accounting and research and
development. The costs of services
are charged by Henkel on a monthly basis and may not reflect the costs, which the Joint Venture would incur if it were necessary to procure such services from outside sources or if such services were
performed internally by the Joint Venture. Related party purchases and fees incurred by the Joint Venture in consideration for these services totaled TDM 178,525, TDM 231,754 and
TDM 227,768 for the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Royalty
payments are shared equally by both parent companies based upon a technology transfer agreement, which provides for the payment of royalties as a percentage of third party
sales. Effective January 1, 1999 the parent companies agreed to reduce the royalty paid by the Joint Venture from 2% to 1% of net sales (as defined). Royalty expense related to this technology
transfer agreement amounted to TDM 14,580, TDM 14,959 and TDM 26,568 during the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The
Joint Venture has entered into agreements with Henkel under which the Joint Venture can both borrow from and lend to Henkel both on an overdraft basis and through short term loans
of no more than 3 months. There is currently no maximum level of borrowing specified under these agreements. The interest rate basis for both arrangements is the Euro London Interbank Offering
Rate (EURO-LIBOR). At November 30, 2000, the interest rates were 5.125% for German Mark overdrafts and 5.25% for 3 month short term German Mark loans. On overdrafts,
approximately 0.5 percentage points are paid to compensate Henkel for administration costs.

At
November 30, 2000 and 1999, loans receivable from Henkel and its subsidiaries totaled TDM 11,811 and TDM 10,152, respectively. The fair values of related party
loans receivable and payable approximate book value.

The
Joint Venture charges the parents for certain costs incurred on behalf of the parents, which by their nature are not arm's length. The Joint Venture has reflected such costs, net
of tax, in the amount of TDM 747, TDM 1,381 and TDM 1,670 as contributed capital for the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

At November 30, 2000 and 1999, the Joint Venture had net foreign operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes of approximately TDM 9,799 and TDM 10,233,
respectively. A significant portion of these losses has an indefinite carry forward period; the remaining losses have expiration dates up to five years.

In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Joint Venture will realize the benefits of these deductible
differences, net of the existing valuation allowances at November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998. During 2000, 1999 and 1998, the valuation allowance increased/(decreased) by TDM (1,357),
TDM (10,336) and TDM (3,757), respectively.

The

should be refunded to the respective parents if the benefits relate to temporary differences that originated in periods prior to the formation of the Joint Venture.

Cash
paid for taxes for the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was TDM 62,239, TDM 51,980 and TDM 35,897, respectively.

Pursuant
to the provisions of Statement Of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 "Employer's Accounting for Pensions", the Company has recorded an additional pension liability
adjustment of TDM 4,479 and TDM 5,012 as of November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of
plan assets exceeded the accrued pension liability for certain German pension plans.


The accumulated benefit obligation for these German plans was TDM 104,253 at November 30, 2000 and TDM 97,107 at November 30, 1999.

The
following amounts, net of tax, have been included within other comprehensive income arising from a change in the additional minimum pension liability for the year ended
November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively TDM (106), TDM 557 and TDM (527).

Short Term Debt

Short-term debt payable to banks of TDM 13,388 and TDM 47,430 at November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, consists primarily
of short-term credit facilities and bank overdrafts. The weighted average interest rate on short-term debt outstanding (in all borrowing entities across Europe) was 6.0% at
November 30, 2000 and 6.5% at November 30, 1999.

At
November 30, 2000, the Company had TDM 140,813 available through multiple bank lines of credit under which the Company may borrow on an overdraft or
short-term basis. Interest rates are based on local money market rates.

Long Term Debt

term debt were:

- - TDM 164        2002 - TDM 3.944

The
fair value of short and long term debt approximates the book value.


8.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The Joint Venture operates internationally, giving market risks, which exposes it to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Derivative financial
instruments are utilized by the Joint Venture to reduce certain of these risks. The Joint Venture does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The Joint Venture is exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments, but it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high credit
ratings.

Notional Amounts and Credit Exposures of Derivatives

The notional amounts of derivatives summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the exposure of the
Joint Venture through its use of derivatives. The amounts exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional amounts and the other terms of the derivatives, which relate to exchange rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Joint Venture enters into various types of foreign exchange contracts in managing its foreign exchange rate risks, as indicated in the following table
(TDM):

Forward exchange contracts

The
purpose of foreign exchange contracts and options purchased is to hedge various intercompany loans and hedge certain existing and anticipated future net foreign exchange
exposures. The anticipated future foreign exchange exposure of the Joint Venture is the total of the net balances of all known and planned incoming and outgoing payments of the Joint Venture's
companies in foreign currencies during a twelve month time horizon. Gains and losses arising from hedged loan transactions are accrued to income over the period of the hedge. The deferred gains and
losses as of November 30, 2000 and 1999 were not material. Losses on hedges of anticipated exchange rate exposure are recorded as incurred whereas gains are deferred.


The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of the Joint Venture's forward exchange and option contracts in German Marks. Foreign currency amounts are
translated at rates current at the reporting date. The "buy" amounts represent the German Marks equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the German
Marks equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies:

Fair Value of Off Balance Sheet Financial Instruments

The difference between the fair value and contract value of off balance sheet financial instruments at November 30, 2000 and 1999 is not significant.


9.  RESEARCH EXPENDITURES

Research expenditures which relate to the development of new products and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to existing products,
were MDM 37.0, MDM 36.5 and MDM 34.6 for the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.


10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Joint Venture has a number of operating lease agreements primarily involving motor vehicles, computer and other office equipment. The following is a
schedule by year of the future minimum lease payments required under the operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year as of November 30,
2000:

The
Joint Venture is subject to lawsuits and claims arising out of the conduct of its business, including those relating to commercial transactions and environmental safety. Although
the outcomes of such matters are unpredictable, management believes that the final disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the combined financial position or results of operations of
the Joint Venture. As an integral part of the Joint Venture agreement, Henkel and Ecolab have provided certain representations and warranties against future expenditures related to lawsuits arising
from operations prior to July 1,1991.

The
