Item
1.  Business

.

Item 1(a) General Development of Business

.

Ecolab
was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1924.  Our fiscal year is the calendar year ending December 31.

During
2007, we continued to make business acquisitions to broaden our product
offerings and expand our geographic coverage, consistent with our “Circle the
Customer – Circle the Globe” strategy.

In
January 2007, we established a direct operation in the United Arab
Emirates.  We previously operated in the
country through a distributor, and purchased that business to form the new
direct operation in the country.  Annual
sales are approximately $3 million and became part of our International
operations beginning in the first quarter of 2007.

In
February 2007, we acquired Apprise Technologies, Inc., a
Minnesota-based developer of optical sensor technology solutions.  Annual sales are approximately $1 million and
became part of our U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operations beginning in
the first quarter of 2007.

In
March 2007, we acquired Green Harbour, a Hong Kong-based provider of pest
elimination services in China and Hong Kong. 
Annual sales are approximately $4 million and became part of our
International operations beginning in the second quarter of 2007.

In
May 2007, we acquired Fuma Pest, a New Zealand-based provider of pest
elimination services.  Annual sales are
approximately $2 million and became part of our International operations
beginning in the second quarter of 2007.

In
June 2007, we acquired Eagle Environmental Systems, a provider of pest
elimination services based in Sydney, Australia.  Annual sales are approximately $4 million and
became part of our International operations beginning in the third quarter of
2007.

In
September 2007, we made a minority investment in Site Controls, LLC, a
leading provider of energy management and business intelligence solutions.


In November 2007, we acquired Microtek Medical Holdings, Inc.,
a manufacturer and marketer of infection control products for healthcare and
acute care facilities. Microtek’s specialized product lines include infection
barrier equipment drapes, patient drapes, fluid control products and operating
room cleanup systems.    Microtek’s 2006
sales were approximately $150 million and became part of our U.S. Cleaning &
Sanitizing and International operations.

Regarding business dispositions, we completed
the sale of Peter Cox Limited, a leading United Kingdom provider of damp
proofing, waterproofing, timber preservation and wall stabilization for
residential, commercial and public properties, in September 2007. We
acquired Peter Cox Limited in connection with our 2002 purchase of the Terminix
Pest Control business in the United Kingdom. 
2006 revenues for the Peter Cox business were GBP 16 million
(approximately $32 million).

Additional
details regarding certain of the above transactions are found in Note 5 located
on pages 35 and 36 of the Annual Report, and incorporated into Item 8 of
this Form 10-K.

Item 1(b) Financial Information About Operating Segments

.

The
financial information about reportable segments appearing under the heading “Operating
Segments” in Note 16, located on pages 45 and 46 of the Annual Report, is
incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1(c) Narrative Description of Business

.

General

:

Ecolab develops and markets premium products and services for the
hospitality, foodservice, healthcare and industrial markets.  We provide cleaning and sanitizing products
and programs, as well as pest elimination, maintenance and repair services
primarily to hotels and restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities,
quick-service (fast-food and other convenience store) units, grocery stores,
commercial and institutional laundries, light industry, dairy plants and farms,
food and beverage processors and the vehicle wash industry.  A strong commitment to customer support and
sustainable solutions is a distinguishing characteristic of our business.  Additional information on our business
philosophy is found below under the heading “Additional Information –
Competition” of this Item 1(c).

The
following description of our business is based upon our three reportable
segments as reported in our consolidated financial statements.  However, we pursue a “Circle the Customer –
Circle the Globe” strategy by providing products, systems and services which
serve our customer base, and do so on a global basis to meet the needs of our
customers’ various operations around the world. 
Therefore, one customer may utilize the products or services of all
three of the segments and there is interdependence among the operating
segments.  Revenues of our International
segment include sales outside the United States by our Kay and Pest Elimination
businesses.

United States Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment

The
“United States Cleaning & Sanitizing” segment is comprised of seven
business units which provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs to
United States markets.

Institutional

:  Our Institutional Division is
our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing
dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (“warewashing”),
for on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and health care customers)
and for general housekeeping functions, as well as food safety products and
equipment, dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice,
lodging, educational and healthcare industries, and water filters to the
foodservice industry.  The Institutional
Division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and
other commercial customers.  The
Institutional Division manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing
device systems, which are made available to customers, to dispense our cleaners
and sanitizers. In addition, the Institutional Division markets a lease program
comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives
and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance.


We
believe we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products and
programs to institutions in the United States.

The
Institutional Division sells its products and programs primarily through
company-employed field sales personnel. 
However, to a significant degree, we also utilize independent,
third-party foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller
accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors.  We provide the same customer support to
accounts supplied by food distributors as to direct customers.

Effective
January 1, 2007, we integrated our former Professional Products division
into the Institutional Division to deliver a broad range of cleaning and floor
care products and programs to customers in hospitality, health care and
commercial facilities.  The Institutional
sales force, along with a network of independent, third-party distributors
serving the commercial janitorial industry, market Professional Products’
proprietary offerings (detergents, general purpose cleaners, carpet care, stone
care, furniture polishes, disinfectants, floor care products, hand soaps and
odor counteractants).

Kay

:  Our Kay Division (which consists of certain
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ecolab Inc.) supplies chemical cleaning and
sanitizing products primarily to national and regional quick-service restaurant
chains.  Kay’s products include specialty
and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes,
hand care products and assorted cleaning tools. 
Products are sold under the “Kay” brand or the customer’s private label.
In addition, Kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and
technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers.  Kay’s customized cleaning and sanitation
programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing
sanitation levels, cleaning performance, equipment life and safety levels.

Kay
employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and
regional quick-service restaurants and franchisees, although the sales are made
to distributors who supply the chain or franchisee’s units.

We
believe that our Kay Division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and
sanitizing products to the traditional quick-service restaurant industry in the
United States.  While Kay’s customer base
has been growing, Kay’s business is largely dependent upon a limited number of
major quick-service restaurant chains and franchisees.  Kay continues to seek growth and
diversification opportunities.

In
addition, through Kay’s Food Retail business, the Division supplies cleaning
and sanitizing products to the food retail (i.e., grocery store) industry.  Food Retail products are sold primarily
through distributors and include specialty and general purpose hard surface
cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products, assorted cleaning
tools and floor care products. We provide the same customer support to accounts
supplied by distributors as to direct customers.

Food & Beverage

:  Our Food & Beverage
Division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the beginning of the food chain
to facilitate the production of products for human consumption.  The Division provides detergents, cleaners,
sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as well as cleaning systems,
electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical
products, primarily to dairy plants, dairy farms, breweries, soft-drink
bottling plants, and meat, poultry and other food processors.  The Food & Beverage Division is also
a leading developer and marketer of antimicrobial products used in direct
contact with meat, poultry, seafood and produce during processing in order to
reduce microbial contamination on those surfaces.  The Division also designs, engineers and
installs CIP (“clean-in-place”) process control systems and facility cleaning
systems for its customer base.   Farm
products are sold through dealers and independent, third-party distributors,
while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel.

We believe that we are one of the leading
suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy farm,
food, meat and poultry, and beverage/brewery processor industries in the United
States.


Textile Care

: Our Textile Care Division provides chemical
laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems, as well as related
programs, to large industrial and commercial laundries.  Typically these customers process a minimum
of 1,000,000 pounds of linen each year and include free-standing laundry plants
used by institutions such as hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities as
well as industrial and textile rental laundries.  Products and programs include laundry
cleaning and specialty products, related dispensing equipment, plus water and
energy management which are marketed primarily through a Company-employed sales
force and, to a lesser extent, through independent, third-party distributors.
The Division’s programs are designed to meet our customer’s need for
exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the
customer’s overall operating cost.

Healthcare

:  Our
Healthcare Division provides infection prevention and healthcare offerings to
hospital, acute care and long-term care markets in the United States.  Healthcare’s proprietary infection
prevention/healthcare products (skin care, disinfectants and instrument
cleaners) are sold primarily under the “Ecolab”, “Huntington” and “Microtek”
brand names.

Vehicle Care

:

Our
Vehicle Care Division provides vehicle appearance products which include soaps,
polishes, sealants, wheel and tire treatments and air fresheners. Products are
sold to vehicle rental, fleet and consumer car wash and detail operations.  Brand names utilized by the Vehicle Care
Division include Blue Coral

Ò

, Black Magic

Ò

and Rain-X

Ò

.

Water Care Services

:  Water Care Services provides
water and wastewater treatment products, services and systems for
commercial/institutional customers (full service hotels, cruise ships,
hospitals, healthcare, commercial real estate, government, and commercial
laundries), food and beverage customers (dairies, meat, poultry, food
processing and beverage) and other light industry. Water Care Services works
closely with our Institutional, Textile Care and Food & Beverage
Divisions to offer customized water care strategies to their accounts that have
water care needs, primarily to treat water used in heating and cooling systems
and manufacturing processes and to treat wastewater.

United States Other Services Segment

The
“United States Other Services” segment is comprised of two business units:  Pest Elimination and GCS Service.  In general, these businesses provide service
or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business
customers as a part of our “Circle the Customer” approach.

Pest Elimination

:  Our Pest Elimination Division
provides services for the detection, elimination and prevention of pests to
restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare
facilities, hotels, quick-service restaurant and grocery operations and other
institutional and commercial customers. 
These services are sold and performed by Company-employed sales and
service personnel.  In addition, through
our EcoSure Food Safety Management business, we provide customized on-site
evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations.

GCS Service

:  GCS Service provides commercial cooking and
refrigeration equipment repair and maintenance services for restaurant and
other foodservice operations.  Repair
services are offered for in-warranty repair, acting as the Manufacturer’s
Authorized Service Agent, as well as after warranty repair.  In addition, GCS Service operates as a parts
distributor to repair service companies and end users.

International Segment

We conduct business in approximately 70
countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in
the case of Israel and Venezuela, through joint ventures with local
partners.  In other countries, selected
products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or
licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of
our overall revenues.  Our largest
International operations are located in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America


and Canada, with smaller operations in Africa
and the Middle East.

In
general, the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those
conducted in the United States but are managed on a geographic basis.  The businesses which are similar to the
United States’ Institutional and Food & Beverage businesses are the
largest businesses in our International operations.  They are conducted in virtually all our
International locations and, compared to the United States, constitute a larger
portion of the overall business.  Kay
also has sales in a number of International locations.  A significant portion of Kay’s international
sales are to international units of United States-based quick-service
restaurant chains. Consequently, a substantial portion of Kay’s international
sales are made either to domestic or internationally-located third-party
distributors who serve these chains.

Our
Pest Elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage.  Since 2001, we have entered markets in Asia,
Western Europe and Latin America, with the largest operations in France and the
United Kingdom.

Our
other businesses are conducted less extensively in our International
locations.  However, in general, most of
the principal businesses conducted in the United States are operated in Canada.

International
businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including
possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, tax laws, currency
exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad.  The profitability of our International
operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses
in the United States.  This has been due
to the smaller scale of the International operations as well as the additional
cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions.

Additional
Information

Competition

:  Our business units have two significant
classes of competitors.  First, each
business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly
or through distributors on a national or international scale.  Second, all of our business units have
numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited
geographies, product lines and/or end-user segments.

Our objective is to achieve a significant
presence in each of our business markets. 
In general, competition is based on customer support, product
performance and price.  We believe we
compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support and
differentiated products to help our customer protect its brand reputation.  Value is provided by state-of-the-art
cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high
customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction.  This is made possible, in part, by our
significant on-going investment in training and technology and by our standard
practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and helping
them comply with safety, environmental and sanitation regulations. In addition,
we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium
cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of
customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations
worldwide.  This approach is succinctly
stated in our “Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe” strategy which is
discussed above in this Item 1(c) under the heading “General.”

Sales

: Products, systems and services are
primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained
sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and
efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of
cleaning and sanitation needs. 
Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets,
as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of
the three reportable segments above.

Number of Employees

:  We
have approximately 26,050 employees.


Customers and Classes of Products

:  We
believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer
although, as described above in this Item 1(c) under the description of
the Kay business, Kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national
and international quick-service chains and franchisees.  Additionally, although we have a diverse
customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of
our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party
distributors, the loss of which could have a material negative effect on
results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider
it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our
financial position.  No material part of
our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a
governmental unit.  We sell two classes
of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales.  Sales of warewashing products in 2007, 2006
and 2005 approximated 22, 21 and 21 percent, respectively, of our consolidated
net sales. In addition, through our Institutional and Textile Care businesses,
we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of
laundry customers.  Sales of laundry
products and services in 2007, 2006 and 2005 approximated 10, 10 and 11
percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.

Patents and Trademarks

:  We
own and license a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual
property, including through a license agreement with Henkel KGaA.  While we have an active program to protect
our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks, and pursuing
legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, we do not believe that
our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.

Seasonality

:  Overall our business does not have a
significant degree of seasonality. 
However, we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results
due to sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating
segments.  Note 17, entitled “Quarterly
Financial Data” located on page 47 of the Annual Report, is incorporated
herein by reference.

Working Capital

:  We have invested in the past,
and will continue to invest in the future, in merchandising equipment
consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and
sanitizing products.  Otherwise, we have
no unusual working capital requirements.

Manufacturing and Distribution

:  We
manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-owned manufacturing
facilities.  Some products are also
produced for us by third-party contract manufacturers, including Henkel
KGaA.  Other products and equipment are
purchased from third-party suppliers. 
Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the
segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing
facilities is located beginning at page 16 of this Form 10-K under
the heading “Properties.”

Deliveries
to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution
centers and public warehouses.  We use
common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors.  Additional information on our plant and
distribution facilities is located beginning at page16 of this Form 10-K
under the heading “Properties.”

Raw Materials

:  Raw materials purchased for
use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including alkalis,
acids, phosphates, silicates and salts, and organic chemicals, including
surfactants and solvents. These materials are generally purchased on an annual
contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers.  When practical, global sourcing is used so
that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs
at globally competitive levels. Pesticides used by our Pest Elimination
Division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order
from the producers or their distributors. 
We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and
components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems.  Most raw materials, or substitutes for those
materials, used by us, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which
we manufacture, are available from several suppliers.


Research and Development

:  Our research and development
program consists principally of devising and testing new products, processes,
techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving
service program content, and evaluating the environmental compatibility of
products.  Key disciplines include
analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging
engineering and product dispensing technology. 
Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our
research, development and engineering personnel.  At times, technology has also been licensed
from third parties to develop offerings. 
Note 13, entitled “Research Expenditures” located on page 41 of the
Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

:  Our
businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we
cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable
measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental
effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs
associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances, waste disposal
and plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation
of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain
operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations.
Additionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances,
there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will
not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. Environmental and regulatory matters most
significant to us are discussed below.

Ingredient Legislation

:  Various laws and regulations
have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the
sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or
other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under
California Proposition 65, label disclosures are required for certain products
containing chemicals listed by California. “Green” chemistry initiatives that
promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer
chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states,
including California, Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont. To date, we generally
have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or
labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material negative effect
on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to
date.

Pesticide Legislation

:  Various international, federal
and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use
of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing
products which kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on hard
environmental surfaces and on certain food products. Such products constitute “pesticides”
or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the Federal
Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), as amended by the Food
Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the
manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain
approximately 350 product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy,
toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In
addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and
payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements
different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other
states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a
tax on total pesticide sales in that State. While the cost of complying with rules as
to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results
of operations, financial condition, or cash flows to date, the costs and delays
in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase. Total
fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide
registrations, and for the California tax, were approximately $2,800,000 in
2007 and $3,400,000 in 2006. In Europe, the Biocidal Product Directive
(98/8/EC) (“BPD”) established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of
biocidal active substances and products. We are working with suppliers and
industry


groups
to manage requirements associated with the BPD, and have met the first relevant
deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active
substances. Anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly
affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In
addition, our Pest Elimination Division applies restricted-use pesticides which
it generally purchases from third parties. That Division must comply with
certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing
of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily
by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We
have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these
requirements.

FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements

: 
Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local
and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by
us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals, foods and medical
devices. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). However, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials
applied to food. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to
such products, including proposing regulations in a Tentative Final Monograph
for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products dated June 17, 1994, which may
impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products
and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. To date, such requirements have
not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

Europe

:  The European Union is developing a new
regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of
Chemicals (REACH). The European Parliament and Council adopted the REACH
regulation in December 2006, which became effective in June 2007. It
established a new European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, Finland, which is
responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage
this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe. All
“new” and “existing” chemicals produced or imported into the European Union in
quantities above one ton per year must be registered in a central database. For
chemicals deemed to be of most concern, industry must gain specific
authorization for particular uses which have been demonstrated to be safe.
Other uses would be prohibited. To manage this new program, we are simplifying
our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with
registration requirements. The eventual impact of REACH will also be felt by
our competitors. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable, but are
not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

In
2003, the United Nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling
of chemical products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification
and Labeling of Chemicals (“GHS”). GHS is designed to facilitate international
trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a
worldwide, uniform system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic
hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized
safety labeling and safety warnings. Individual countries and regional
organizations either have begun to implement GHS or are considering what
portions of it will be adopted and within what timeframe. Most countries in
which we operate will adopt GHS-related legislation. The primary cost of
compliance will revolve around labeling, and we are working toward a phased-in
approach to mitigate risks of GHS implementation. Potential costs to us are not
yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.


Other Environmental Legislation

:  Our
manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign
jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances
into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such
substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous
substances into the air, land and water. We make capital investments and
expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to ensure
employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability
principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects
worldwide were approximately $8,100,000 in 2007 and $6,400,000 in 2006.
Approximately $7,800,000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2008.

Climate Change

:  Various laws and regulations
pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for
implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels,
particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
None of these laws and regulations directly applies to Ecolab at the present
time, however, as a matter of corporate policy, Ecolab supports a balanced
approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth and
competitiveness. Ecolab has joined U.S. EPA’s Climate Leaders program, and as
part of that program we have pledged to develop a corporate-wide U.S. GHG
emission inventory and work with EPA to set a GHG reduction goal in 2008.

Environmental Remediation and Proceedings

: 
Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”), we
are currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by
the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (“CERCLA”) or state equivalents at 19 sites in the United States. Additionally,
we have similar liability at nine sites outside the United States. In general,
under CERCLA, we and each other PRP that actually contributes hazardous
substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs
associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the
EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Pursuant to an
Environmental Agreement dated December 7, 2000 with Henkel KGaA, Henkel
agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with
the parties’ former joint venture in Europe. We received euro 626,763
(approximately $917,000) from Henkel in 2007 for such environmental liabilities
and we recently requested an additional euro 203,890 (approximately $300,000 at
December 31, 2007) for new environmental costs.

Based
on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our
estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to
in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by
other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we
have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such
known sites. Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual. In establishing
accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is
not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be
paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and
associated regulatory processes.


Our worldwide net
expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $1,060,000 in
2007 and $950,000 in 2006. Including the ChemLawn matters described below, our
worldwide accruals at December 31, 2007 for probable future remediation
expenditures totaled approximately $3,990,000. We review our exposure for
contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as
considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result
in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our
consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the
ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In
addition, we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former
ChemLawn business is a PRP. Currently there are five such locations and, at
each, ChemLawn is a

de minimis

party. Anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in
our loss from our discontinued ChemLawn operations in 1991. The accrual
remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

.

The following are important
factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual
results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or
other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements
made in this Form 10-K. See the section entitled Forward-Looking
Statements located on page 2 of this Form 10-K.

We may also refer to this
disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those
expressed in other forward-looking statements made in oral presentations,
including telephone conference and/or webcasts open to the public.

Except as may be required
under applicable law, we undertake no duty to update our Forward-Looking
Statements.

Our results depend upon the
continued vitality of the markets we serve:

Economic downturns, and in particular downturns in the foodservice,
hospitality, travel, health care and food processing industries, can adversely
impact our end-users who are sensitive to changes in travel and dining activities.
During such downturns, these end-users typically reduce their volume of
purchases of cleaning, hygiene and appearance products, which would likely in
turn have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
financial condition, or cas

h
flows.

Our growth depends upon our
ability to successfully compete with respect to value, product offerings and
customer support:

Our competitive market is made up of numerous national,
regional and local competitors. Our ability to compete depends in part upon our
ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to
identify, develop and commercialize innovative, high value-added products for
niche applications. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not
place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future. In
addition, certain of the new products that we have under development will be
offered in markets in which we do not currently compete, and there can be no
assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets. If
we fail to timely introduce new technologies, we may lose market share and our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be
adversely affected.

We enter into multi-year contracts with customers
that can impact our results:

We enter
into multi-year contracts with some of our customers which include terms
affecting our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that these
restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and operating income.

Consolidation of our customers
and vendors can affect our results:

Customers and vendors
in the foodservice, hospitality and lodging industry have been consolidating in
recent years and that trend may continue. This consolidation could have an
adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and
operating income.


Our results can be adversely
affected by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials:

The prices of raw
materials used in our business can fluctuate significantly from time to time,
and have increased in recent years. Changes in oil or raw material prices,
unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes
for those raw materials, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements
on favorable terms can adversely affect ou

r consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

If we are unsuccessful
in integrating acquisitions, our business could be adversely affected

:

As part of our long-term strategy, we seek to acquire
complementary businesses. There can be no assurance that we will find
attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the
integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses. If the expected
synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully
integrate new businesses into our existing businesses, our consolidated results
of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.

If we are
unsuccessful in executing on business investments, our business could be
adversely affected:

We are making investments to develop business systems and optimize our business
structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns.
If the projects in which we are investing are not successfully executed, our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be
adversely affected.

Our business depends on our
ability to comply with governmental regulations:

Our business is subject
to numerous regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture,
storage, distribution, sale and use of our products. Compliance with these
regulations, as well as changes in tax, fiscal, governmental and other
regulatory policies expose us to potential financial liability and increase our
operating costs. Regulation of our products and operations continues to
increase with more stringent standards, causing increased costs of operations
and potential for liability if a violation occurs. The potential cost to us
relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is
uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible
contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws
and regulations, and the timing and expense of compliance. In addition, changes
in accounting standards, including the adoption effective January 1, 2007
of FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, could increase the
volatility of our quarterly tax rate.

Our results are impacted by
general worldwide economic factors:

Economic factors such as the worldwide
economy, interest rates and currency movements including, in particular, our
exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and
may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
financial condition, or cash flows in the future.

Extraordinary events may
significantly impact our business:

The occurrence of (a) litigation

or claims,
(b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c) war
(including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets), (d) natural
or manmade disasters, or (e) severe weather conditions or public health
epidemics affecting the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries may have
a significant, adverse impact on our business.

Defense of litigation, particularly certain types of actions such as
antitrust, patent infringement, wage hour and class action lawsuits, can be
costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful, and if not successful
could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.


While we have a diverse customer base and no customer
or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we
do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which
could have a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations
for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an
event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position.

War
(including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or manmade disasters or
severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice,
hospitality and travel industries cause a d

ownturn in the business of restaurants,
motels and hotels and other of our customers, which in turn can have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

We depend on key personnel to
lead our business:

O

ur continued success will largely depend on our ability
to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities
of our executive officers and certain other key employees. Our operations could
be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not
remain with us.

Item
1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

.

We have no unresolved comments from the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

Item
2.  Properties

.

Our
manufacturing philosophy is to manufacture products wherever an economic,
process or quality assurance advantage exists or where proprietary
manufacturing techniques dictate internal production processes. Currently, most
products sold by us are manufactured at our facilities.

Our
manufacturing facilities produce chemical products or equipment for all of our
businesses, although the businesses constituting the United States Other
Services segment purchase the majority of their products and equipment from
outside suppliers. Our chemical production process consists primarily of
blending and packaging powders and liquids and casting solids. Our equipment
manufacturing operations consist primarily of producing chemical product
dispensers and injectors and other mechanical equipment and dishwasher racks
and related sundries.

The
following chart profiles our main manufacturing facilities with ongoing
production activities. In general, manufacturing facilities located in the
United States serve the “United States Cleaning & Sanitizing” segment
and facilities located outside of the United States serve the “International”
segment. However, certain of the United States facilities do manufacture
products for export and which are used by the International segment. The
facilities having export involvement are marked with an asterisk (*).


ECOLAB OPERATIONS PLANT PROFILES


We
believe our manufacturing facilities are in good condition and are adequate to
meet our existing production needs. A new manufacturing facility in Wales, U.K.
is nearing completion.

Most
of our manufacturing plants also serve as distribution centers.  In addition, we operate distribution centers
around the world, all of which are leased, and utilize various public
warehouses to facilitate the distribution of our products and services.  In the United States, our sales and service
associates are located in approximately 90 leased offices. Additional sales
offices are located internationally.

Our
corporate headquarters is comprised of three adjacent multi-storied buildings
located in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. 
The main 19-story building was constructed to our specifications and is
leased through 2013. Thereafter, it is subject to multiple renewals at our
option.  The second building is leased
through 2011 with additional options available. 
The third building is owned.  The
corporate headquarters includes an employee training center.  In April 2004, we purchased a 90 acre campus
in Eagan, Minnesota to provide for future growth.  The acquired facility houses the research and
development and data center requirements as well as several of our
administrative functions.  Renovations of
the buildings on this property, comprising approximately 500,000 square feet,
have been completed and more than 900 associates now work at this site.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

:

As of December 31,

participation of our management, including the Chairman of the Board, President
and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended). Based upon that evaluation, our
Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

:

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chairman of the Board,  President and Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation under this framework,
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2007.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. Their
report, and our management reports, can be found in our Annual Report, the
relevant portion of which has been filed as Exhibit (13) to this Form 10-K
and is incorporated into Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

During the period October 1 - December 31, 2007, there were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Item
9B.  Other Information

.

The following disclosures
would otherwise be filed on Form 8-K under the heading “Item 5.02(e) –
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment
of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.”

In the paragraphs below describing certain of our executive
compensation plans and programs, the “Named Executive Officers or NEOs” refer
to our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer during 2007
and the next three most-highly compensated executive officers who were serving
in those capacities at December 31, 2007, and the “Committee” refers to
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

General

:

The components of the
overall compensation program for the Company’s executive officers include base
salary, long-term incentives in the form of annual stock option awards,
cash-based annual bonus incentives, participation in deferred compensation and
retirement plans, and certain perquisites. 
Information regarding the
compensation awarded to the NEOs in respect of and during the year ended December 31,
2007 will be provided in the definitive proxy statement for the Company’s 2008
annual meeting of stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on or around March 19, 2008.

Base Salary

:

For the 2008 fiscal year, base salaries for the
NEOs, other than the CEO, are scheduled to increase on an annualized basis by
an average of 6.2%.  The
salary of the CEO has been established at $1,000,000, representing an increase of $100,000 over 2007. The base salaries established for the
2008 fiscal year for the NEOs are included as a part of the Named Executive
Officer Summary of Base Salary, Bonus Award Opportunities, and Executive
Benefits and Perquisites filed as Exhibit (10)S to this Form 10-K and
incorporated by reference herein.


Establishment of 2008
Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation Criteria

:

The Company maintains annual cash incentive programs for executives referred
to as the Management Incentive Plan or MIP and Management Performance Incentive
Plan or MPIP. The Company’s stockholders approved the current version of the
MPIP in 2004, an annual incentive plan under which awards should qualify as
performance based under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). On February 20,
2008, as required under the terms of the MPIP, the Committee selected the CEO
and CFO and the three other NEOs to participate in the MPIP for 2008,
established the 2008 performance goal based upon the performance criteria of
diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), set an EPS performance target of a
designated earnings per share, and a designated cash award of 300% of the base
salary of each such officer for 2008 to the extent the goal is achieved. The
award is subject to and interpreted in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the MPIP and no amount will be paid under the MPIP unless and until the
Committee has determined the extent to which the performance goal has been met
and the corresponding amount of the award earned by the participant.  The MPIP permits the Committee to exercise
downward discretion so as to pay an amount which is less than the amount of the
award earned by the participant.  In
applying this downward discretion, the Committee considers underlying operable
metrics communicated to the participant, which are described as a part of the Named Executive Officer Summary of Base Salary,
Bonus Award Opportunities, and Executive Benefits and Perquisites filed as Exhibit (10)S to this Form 10-K and incorporated by
reference herein.  One other NEO
will participate in the MIP in 2008 and the operating metrics with respect to
such NEOs’ participation are similarly included as a part of Exhibit (10)S.

The following disclosures
would otherwise be filed on Form 8-K under the heading “Item 5.03 -
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.”

Ecolab’s Board of Directors approved the following amendments to the Company’s
By-Laws:  (1) Article IV, Section 1
was amended to reflect that the Board may elect one or more Sector Presidents; (2) Article VII,
Section 1 was amended to include the position of Sector Presidents and

and (3) Article VI, Section 1 and Section 2 were amended to
allow stock to be issued in book-entry form without a physical stock

SIGNATURES

Pursuant
