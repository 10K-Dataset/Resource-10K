PART I

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe
harbor for forward-looking statements. 
In this Report on Form 10-K (including Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations incorporated into
Item 7 hereof), Management discusses expectations regarding future performance
of the Company which include anticipated business progress and expansion,
business acquisitions, debt repayments, susceptibility to changes in
technology, global economic conditions and liquidity requirements.  Without limiting the foregoing, words or
phrases such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is
anticipated,” “we believe,” “estimate,” “project” (including the negative or
variations thereof) or similar terminology, generally identify forward-looking
statements.  Additionally, the Company
may refer to this section of the Form 10-K to identify risk factors related to
other forward looking statements made in oral presentations, including
telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public.

Forward-looking statements represent challenging goals for the
Company.  As such, they are based on
current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties.  The Company cautions that undue reliance
should not be placed on such forward-looking statements which speak only as of
the date made.  In order to comply with
the terms of the safe harbor, the Company hereby identifies important factors
which could affect the Company’s financial performance and could cause the
Company’s actual results for future periods to differ materially from the
anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking
statements.

Risks and uncertainties that may affect operating results and business
performance include:  the vitality of
the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries; restraints on pricing
flexibility due to competitive factors and customer and vendor consolidations;
changes in oil or raw material prices or unavailability of adequate and
reasonably priced raw materials; the occurrence of capacity constraints or the
loss of a key supplier; the effect of future acquisitions or divestitures or
other corporate transactions; the Company’s ability to achieve plans for past acquisitions;
the costs and effects of complying with: (i) laws and regulations relating to
the environment and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, efficacy and
labeling of the Company’s products, and (ii) changes in tax, fiscal,
governmental and other regulatory policies; economic factors such as the
worldwide economy, interest rates, and currency movements including, in
particular, the Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk; the occurrence of
(a) litigation or claims, (b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or
distributor, (c) war, (d) natural or manmade disasters (including material acts
of terrorism or hostilities which impact the Company’s markets) and (e) severe
weather conditions


affecting the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries; loss of,
or changes in, executive management; the Company’s ability to continue product
introductions and technological innovations; and other uncertainties or risks
reported from time to time in the Company’s reports to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  In addition, the
Company notes that its stock price can be affected by fluctuations in quarterly
earnings.  There can be no assurances
that the Company’s earnings levels will meet investors’ expectations.

Item 1(a)

General Development of Business

Except where the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company” and
“Ecolab,” as used herein, include Ecolab Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Ecolab Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware
corporation in 1924.  The Company’s
fiscal year is the calendar year ending December 31.

On November 30, 2001, the Company acquired the 50 percent of the
Henkel-Ecolab joint venture (“Henkel-Ecolab”) which the Company did not
previously own (the “JV Acquisition”), from its joint venture partner, Henkel
KGaA, Düsseldorf, Germany (“Henkel”).

Prior to the JV Acquisition, the Company accounted for its interest in
Henkel-Ecolab under the equity method of accounting.  As a result of the JV Acquisition, the legal entities
constituting Henkel-Ecolab became wholly-owned entities of the Company.  Following the JV Acquisition, the assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Henkel-Ecolab are reflected
in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a part of the Company’s
International Cleaning & Sanitizing reportable segment.

Financial statements of Henkel-Ecolab, in respect of certain periods
prior to the November 30, 2001 date of the JV Acquisition as listed under Item
15.I(3) of Part IV hereof, are included as a part of this Report and a review
of Henkel-Ecolab financial performance is found under the heading
“Henkel-Ecolab” contained in the Financial Discussion which is incorporated
from the Annual Report into Item 7 hereof.

During 2002, the Company continued to make business acquisitions which
broadened its product and service offerings in line with its “Circle the
Customer – Circle the Globe” strategy.

In January 2002, the Company acquired certain operations of Kleencare
Hygiene located in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and the
Netherlands.  These operations provide
products, systems and services for the food and beverage industry.  This acquisition represented the Company’s
first step following the JV Acquisition to leverage and expand its wholly-owned
operations in Europe.

In January 2002, the Company also purchased Audits International, a
Chicago, Illinois-based provider of food safety services in the United States.

In April 2002, the Company acquired a 20% interest in Central Ankoff
FNZ Holding B.V., located in the Netherlands. 
CA FNZ is the Company’s local distributor in the food processing and
farm sector marketplace.

In September 2002, the Company expanded its pest elimination business
to Europe by purchasing Terminix Limited, a London-based provider of commercial
pest elimination and property services throughout the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland.


In November 2002, the Company entered into an exclusive marketing
agreement with Intralytix, Inc. to market a technology to control food-borne
pathogens in the food and beverage industry. 
In addition, the Company made a loan to Intralytix and, if certain
milestones are achieved by November 2004, the Company would be obligated to
purchase certain Common Stock and Common Stock warrants of Intralytix.

In November 2002, the Company acquired certain assets, including a
manufacturing plant of ARAMARK Management Services, which provided specialty
chemicals for the foodservice industry.

In December 2002, the Company entered the hospital hygiene market in
the United Kingdom by acquiring the Adams Healthcare business of Medical
Solutions plc.

In 2002, the Company completed two business divestment
transactions.  In August, the Company
sold its 50% interest in Dairy Partners LLC, a joint venture that operates a
dairy farm distribution business.  The
Company sold its interest to its joint venture partner, Dairy Farmers of
America.  In December, the Company sold
its Darenas janitorial products distribution business based in Birmingham, U.K.
to Bunzl plc of London, U.K.

Additional details of certain of these transactions are found under the
heading “Other Business Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Note 6, located
on pages 38 and 39 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 8 hereof.

Financial Information About Operating Segments

The financial information about reportable segments appearing under the
heading “Operating Segments” in Note 16, located on pages 46 and 47 of the
Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1(c)

Narrative Description of Business

General:

The Company is engaged in the development
and marketing of premium products and services for the hospitality,
institutional and industrial markets. 
The Company provides cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance
and repair products, systems and services primarily to hotels and restaurants,
foodservice, healthcare and educational facilities, quick-service (fast food
and other convenience store) units, grocery stores, commercial and
institutional laundries, light industry, dairy plants and farms, food and
beverage processors, pharmaceutical and cosmetics facilities and the vehicle
wash industry.  A strong commitment to
customer support is a distinguishing characteristic of the Company.  Additional information on the Company’s
business philosophy is found below under the heading “Additional Information –
Competition” of this Item 1(c).

The following description of business is based upon the Company’s three
reportable segments (“segments”) as reported in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.  However, the
Company pursues a “Circle the Customer – Circle the Globe” strategy by providing
products, systems and services which serve the Company’s customer base, and
does so on a global basis to meet the needs of its customer’s various
operations around the world.  Therefore,
one customer may utilize the services of all three of the segments and there is
a degree of interdependence among the operating segments—particularly between
the International Cleaning & Sanitizing and the United States Cleaning
& Sanitizing businesses.


United States
Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment

The “United States Cleaning & Sanitizing” segment is comprised of
seven divisions which provide cleaning and sanitizing services to United States
markets.

Institutional

:  The Institutional Division is the Company’s
largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing
dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment
(“warewashing”), for on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and health
care customers) and for general housekeeping functions, as well as dishwasher
racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and
healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry.  The Institutional Division also provides
pool and spa treatment programs for commercial and hospitality customers and,
through its Facilitec business, provides rooftop grease filter products and
kitchen exhaust cleaning services for restaurants and other foodservice
operations. The Institutional Division also manufactures and markets various
chemical dispensing device systems, which are made available to customers, to
dispense the Company’s cleaners and sanitizers. In addition, the Institutional
Division markets primarily to smaller and mid-size customer units, a program
comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives
and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance.

The Company believes it is the leading supplier of chemical warewashing
products to institutions in the United States.

The Institutional Division sells its products and services primarily
through Company-employed field sales-and-service personnel.  However, the Company, to a significant
degree, also utilizes independent, third-party foodservice distributors to
market and sell its products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase
through food distributors.  The Company
provides the same service to accounts served by food distributors as to direct
customers.

Kay

:  The Kay Division (which consists of certain
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company) supplies chemical cleaning and
sanitizing products primarily to the quick-service restaurant industry. This
includes traditional fast food restaurants but also other retail locations
where “fast food” is prepared and served, such as convenience stores, airport
and shopping center kiosks and other public venues typically serviced by
national or regional restaurant chains. 
Kay also sells cleaning and sanitizing products, to the food retail
(i.e., grocery store) industry.  Kay’s
products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners,
degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning
tools.  Products are sold under the
“Kay” brand or the customer’s private label. In addition, Kay supports its product
sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet
the special needs of its customers. 
Kay’s customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce
labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels, cleaning
performance, equipment life and safety levels.

Kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon
national and regional quick-service restaurant and food retail chains and
franchisees, although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain
or franchisee’s units.

The Company believes that its Kay Division is the leading supplier of
chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick-service
restaurant industry in the United States. 
While Kay’s customer base has been growing, Kay’s business is largely
dependent upon a limited number of major quick-service restaurant chains and
franchisees.


Food
& Beverage

:  The
Food & Beverage Division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the start of
the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human
consumption.  The Division provides
detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as
well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the
application of chemical products, primarily to dairy plants, dairy farms,
breweries, soft-drink bottling plants, and meat, poultry and other food
processors as well as to pharmaceutical and cosmetic plants. The division also
markets food irradiation services through an alliance with Ion Beam
Applications (IBA).  The Food &
Beverage Division also designs, engineers and installs CIP (“clean-in-place”)
process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer
base.   Farm products are sold through
dealers and independent, third-party distributors, while plant products are
sold primarily by the Company’s field sales personnel.

The Company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of
cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy farm, food, meat and
poultry, and beverage/brewery processor industries in the United States.

Textile Care

: The Textile Care Division
provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems, as well
as related services, to large institutional and commercial laundries.  Typically these customers process a minimum
of 1,000,000 pounds of linen each year and include free-standing laundry plants
used by institutions such as hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities as
well as industrial and textile rental laundries.  The Division also serves the shirt laundry market, typically
comprised of smaller laundry units. 
Products and services include laundry cleaning and specialty products
and related dispensing equipment, which are marketed primarily through a
Company-employed sales force and, to a lesser extent, through independent,
third-party distributors. The Division’s programs are designed to meet the
customer’s need for exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of
linen and reducing the customer’s overall operating cost.  Textile Care offerings complement the
Institutional Division’s offerings to on-premise laundry facilities.

Professional
Products:

The
Professional Products Division provides a broad range of janitorial and
infection prevention/healthcare offerings to the janitorial and medical markets
in the United States. Its proprietary janitorial products (detergents, general
purpose cleaners, carpet care, furniture polishes, disinfectants, floor care
products, hand soaps and odor counteractants) are sold primarily under the
brand name “Airkem,” and proprietary infection prevention/healthcare products
(skin care, disinfectants and instrument sterilants) are sold primarily under
the “Huntington” brand name.  These
products are sold primarily through a network of independent, third-party
distributors, supported by a Company-employed sales force.

The Division also sells certain specialty chemical products which are
manufactured for third parties. These offerings include the manufacture of a
small line of private label products and house brand products for third
parties.

Vehicle
Care:

The Company’s
Vehicle Care Division provides vehicle appearance products which include soaps,
polishes, wheel and tire treatments and air fresheners.  Products are sold to vehicle rental, fleet
and consumer car wash and detail operations. 
Brand names utilized by the Vehicle Care Division include Blue Coral

Ò

,
Black Magic

Ò

and Rain-X

Ò

.

Water
Care Services

:  Water
Care Services supplements the Company’s “Circle the Customer - Circle the
Globe” strategy by offering water treatment programs that are critical to the
Company’s customer base.  Water Care
Services provides water and wastewater treatment products, services and systems
for commercial/institutional customers (full service hotels, cruise ships,
hospitals,


healthcare, commercial real estate, government, and commercial
laundries), food and beverage customers (dairies, meat, poultry, food
processing and beverage) and other light industry.  Water Care Services works closely with the Company’s
Institutional, Textile Care and Food & Beverage Divisions to offer
customized water care strategies to their accounts that have water care needs,
primarily to treat water used in heating and cooling systems and manufacturing
processes and to treat wastewater.

United States Other Services Segment

The “United States Other Services” segment is comprised of two business
units:  Pest Elimination and GCS
Service.  In general, these businesses
provide service or equipment which can augment or extend the Company’s product
offering to its business customers as a part of the “Circle the Customer”
approach.

Pest
Elimination

:  The Pest
Elimination Division provides services for the detection, elimination and
prevention of pests to restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational
and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick-service restaurant and grocery
operations and other institutional and commercial customers.  These services are sold and performed by
Company-employed sales and service personnel. 
In addition, through its EcoSure Food Safety Management business, the
Division provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance
services to foodservice operations.

GCS
Service

:  GCS provides
commercial kitchen parts and equipment repair services including parts
distribution.  GCS offers these services
to restaurant and other foodservice operations, while providing warranty
service for equipment manufacturers.  In
addition, GCS offers parts at a wholesale level to repair services companies
and end users.

International Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment

The Company conducts business in approximately 70 countries outside of
the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in the case of China,
Israel and Venezuela, through majority-owned joint ventures with local
partners.  In other countries, selected
products are sold by the Company’s export operations to distributors, agents or
licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of
the Company’s overall revenues.  The
largest International operations are located in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin
America and Canada, with smaller operations in Africa.

In general, the
businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the
United States, although the Company customizes its products and services to
meet unique local requirements.  The
businesses which are similar to the United States’ Institutional and Food &
Beverage businesses are the largest businesses in International
operations.  They are conducted in
virtually all International locations and, compared to the United States,
constitute a larger portion of the overall business.  Kay also has sales in a number of International locations.  A significant portion of its International
sales are to international units of United States-based quick-service
restaurant chains.  Consequently, a
substantial portion of Kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or
internationally-located third-party distributors who serve these chains. The
Company expanded its pest elimination business to the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland by acquiring a London-based provider of commercial pest
elimination services in September 2002. 
In addition, the Company entered the hospital hygiene market in the
United Kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in December
2002.  The Company’s other businesses
are conducted less extensively in International locations.  However, in general, all of the businesses
conducted in the United States are operated in Canada.


International businesses
are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes
in trade and foreign investment laws, tax laws, currency exchange rates and
economic and political conditions abroad. 
The profitability of International operations has historically been
lower than the profitability of businesses in the United States.  This has been due to the smaller scale of
International operations where several operating locations are smaller in size
as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign
jurisdictions.

Additional Information

Competition

:  The Company’s business units have two
significant classes of competitors. 
First, each business unit competes with a small number of large
companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or
international scale.  Second, all of the
Company’s business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors
which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-user
segments.

The Company’s objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of
its business markets.  In general,
competition is based on service, product performance and price.  The Company believes it competes principally
by providing superior value and differentiated products.  Value is provided by state-of-the-art
cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high
customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer
satisfaction.  This is made possible, in
part, by the Company’s significant on-going investment in training and
technology and by the Company’s standard practice of advising customers on
means to lower operating costs and comply with safety, environmental and
sanitation regulations. In addition, the Company emphasizes its ability to
uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services
to its customers and to provide that level of service to multiple locations of
chain customer organizations worldwide. 
This approach is succinctly stated in the Company’s “Circle the Customer
- - Circle the Globe” strategy which is discussed above in this Item 1(c) under
the heading “General.”

Sales
and Service

: Products, systems and services are primarily
marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained sales and
service personnel who also advise and assist customers in the proper and
efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of
cleaning and sanitation needs. 
Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets,
as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of
the three reportable segments above.

Customers and Classes of Service

:  The Company believes that its business is
not materially dependent upon a single customer although, as described above in
this Item 1(c) under the description of the Kay business, Kay is largely
dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick-service
chains and franchisees.  Additionally,
although the Company has a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor
constitutes ten percent or more of the Company’s consolidated revenues, the Company
does have customers and independent, third-party distributors (for example,
ARAMARK, Sodexho, Sysco and U.S. Foodservice), the loss of which could have a
material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings
periods; however, the Company considers it unlikely that such an event would
have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company.  No material part of the Company’s business
is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental
unit. The Company sells two classes of products which each constitute 10
percent or more of its sales.  Sales of
warewashing products in 2002, 2001 and 2000 approximated 23, 26 and 26 percent,
respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales.  In addition, the Company, through its
Institutional and Textile Care businesses, sells laundry products and services
to a broad range of laundry customers.  
Sales of


laundry products and
services in 2002, 2001 and 2000 approximated 12, 10 and 11 percent,
respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Sales of the recently
acquired Henkel-Ecolab operations are reflected in these percentages beginning
in 2002.

Patents and Trademarks

:  The Company owns and licenses a number of
patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, including a license
agreement with Henkel KGaA.  While the
Company has an active program to protect its intellectual property by filing
for patents or trademarks, and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to
prevent infringement, management does not believe that the Company’s overall
business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.

Seasonality

:  Overall the Company’s business does not have
a significant degree of seasonality.

Working
Capital

:  The Company
has invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in
merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to
dispense the Company’s cleaning and sanitizing products.  The Company, otherwise, has no unusual
working capital requirements.  The
investment in merchandising equipment is discussed under the heading “Cash
Flows” located on page 28 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 7
hereof.

Manufacturing
and Distribution

: The Company manufactures most of its prod­ucts
and related equipment in Company-owned manufacturing facilities.  Some products are also produced for the
Company by third-party contract manufacturers, including Henkel KGaA.  Other products and equipment are purchased
from third-party suppliers.  Additional
information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions
above and additional information on the Company’s manufacturing facilities is
located beginning at page 15 hereof under the heading “Properties.”

Deliveries to customers are made from the Company’s manufacturing
plants and a network of distribution centers and public ware­houses.  The Company uses common carriers, its own
deliv­ery vehicles and distributors. 
Additional information on the Company’s plant and distribution
facilities is located beginning at page 15 hereof under the heading
“Properties.”

Raw
Materials

:  Raw
materials purchased for use in manufacturing products for the Company are
inorganic chemicals, including phosphates, silicates, alkalies, salts and
organic chemicals, including surfactants and solvents.  These materials are generally purchased on
an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers.  Pesticides used by the Pest Elimination
Division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order
from the producers or their distributors. 
The Company also purchases packaging materials for its manufactured
products and components for its specialized cleaning equipment and
systems.  Most raw materials, or
substitutes for those materials, used by the Company, with the exception of a
few specialized chemicals which the Company manufactures, are available from
several suppliers.

Research
and Development

:  The
Company’s research and development program consists principally of devising and
testing new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the
efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, and evaluating
the environmental compatibility of products. 
Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry,
microbiology, process and packaging engineering and product dispensing
technology.  Substantially all of the
Company’s principal products have been developed by its research, development
and engineering personnel. At times, technology has also been licensed from
outside the Company to develop offerings. 
Note 13, entitled “Research Expenditures” located on page 43 of the
Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.


Environmental
and Regulatory Considerations

:  This discussion of Environmental and Regulatory Considerations
should be read in light of the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
discussion found under Part I at the beginning of this Report.  The Company’s businesses are subject to
various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of
the environment and public health. 
While the Company cooperates with governmental authorities and takes
commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or
limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in the Company’s
businesses.  Among the risks are costs
associated with managing hazardous substances, waste disposal or plant site
clean-up, fines and penalties if the Company were found in violation of law, as
well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or
types of operations including product recalls. 
Additionally, although the Company is not currently aware of any such
circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement
policies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  Environmental and regulatory matters most
significant to the Company are discussed below.

Ingredient Legislation:

Various laws and regulations have been
enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of
products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other
ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California
Proposition 65, label disclosures are required for certain products containing
chemicals listed by California.  To
date, the Company generally has been able to comply with such legislative
requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications.  Such legislation has not had a material
negative effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
condition or liquidity to date.

Pesticide Legislation:

Various federal and state environmental laws
and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides.  The Company manufactures and sells certain
disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms (bacteria, viruses,
fungi) on environmental surfaces and on certain food products. Such products
constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current
definitions of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”),
as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal
statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of
pesticides.  The Company maintains
approximately 400 product registrations with the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”).  Registration
entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling
requirements and to pay on-going registration fees.  In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires
registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive
requirements different from those required by FIFRA.  However, California and certain other states have adopted
additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide
sales in that State.  While the cost of
complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or the results of its operations
to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these
products have increased in recent years. 
Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain
pesticide registrations, and for the California tax, were approximately
$2,500,000 in 2002 and $2,200,000 in 2001. 
Congress is evaluating legislation that would increase these fees.  Absent such a change, anticipated
registration costs are not expected to significantly affect the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.


In addition, the Company’s Pest Elimination Division
applies restricted-use pesticides which it generally purchases from third
parties.  That Division must comply with
certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing
of employees who apply such pesticides. 
Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local
jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations.  The Company has not experienced material difficulties in
complying with these requirements.

FDA Antimicrobial Product
Requirements

:  Various
laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign
jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by the Company
for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals, processed foods, and medical
devices.  In the United States, these
requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).  The FDA has been
expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing
regulations in a Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug
Products dated June 17, 1994 that may impose additional requirements and
associated costs when finalized by the FDA. 
To date, such requirements have not had a material negative effect on
the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or
liquidity.

Other Environmental
Legislation:

The
Company’s manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign
jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances
into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such
substances.  The primary federal
statutes that apply to the Compa­ny’s activities are the Clean Air Act, the
Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”).  The Company is also subject to the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting
requirements as to emissions of toxic substances into the air, land and water.  The Company makes capital investments and
expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to ensure
employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship
principles.  To date, such expenditures
have not had a significant adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results
of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  The Company’s capital expenditures for environmental control
projects were approximately $1,611,000 for 2002, $1,540,000 for 2001and
approximately $1,480,000 has been budgeted for 2003.

Environmental Remediation
and Proceedings

:

Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”), the
Company is currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities
imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state equivalents at approximately 18 sites in the
United States.  Additionally, the
Company has similar liability at eight sites outside the United States.  In general, under CERCLA, the Company and
each other PRP which actually contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund
site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up
the site.  Customarily, the PRPs will
work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.

Based on an
analysis of the Company’s experience with such environmental proceedings, the
Company’s estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites
referred to in the preceding paragraph, and the Company’s estimate of the
contribution to be made by other PRPs which the Company believes have the


financial ability
to pay their shares, the Company has accrued its best estimate of the Company’s
probable future costs relating to such known sites.  Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual.  In establishing accruals, potential
insurance reimbursements are not included. 
The accrual is not discounted. 
It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due
to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated
regulatory processes.

The Company’s worldwide net expenditures for
contamination remediation were approximately $500,000 in 2002 and $500,000 in
2001.  Including the ChemLawn matters
described below, the Company’s worldwide accruals at December 31, 2002 for
probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately $3,800,000.  The Company reviews its exposure for
contamination remediation costs periodically and its accruals are adjusted as
considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result
in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, the
Company believes the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a
material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.  In connection with the JV
Acquisition, Ecolab and Henkel entered into an Environmental Agreement dated
December 7, 2000 under which Henkel agreed to indemnify Ecolab for certain
environmental liabilities associated with the former JV.  As of December 31, 2002, Henkel’s
outstanding reimbursement obligation to Ecolab for such environmental liabilities
was 108,319 euro (or approximately $116,000). 
In addition, the Company has retained responsibility for certain sites
where the Company’s former ChemLawn business is a PRP.  Currently there are five such locations and,
at each, ChemLawn is a

de minimis

party.  Anticipated costs currently accrued for
these matters were included in the Company’s loss from its discontinued
ChemLawn operations in 1991.  The
accrual remaining reflects management’s best estimate of probable future costs.

Number
of Employees

:  The
Company currently has approximately 20,400 employees.

Item 2

.  Properties

The Company’s
manufacturing facilities produce chemical products or equipment for all the
Company’s businesses, although the Pest Elimination Division, GCS and the
Facilitec businesses purchase most of their products and equipment from outside
suppliers.  The Company’s chemical
production process consists primarily of blending and packaging powders and
liquids and casting solids.  The
Company’s equipment manufacturing operations consist primarily of producing
chemical product dispensers and ejectors and other mechanical equipment (South
Beloit, Illinois) and dishwasher racks and related sundries (Elk Grove Village,
Illinois).  The Company’s philosophy is
to manufacture products wherever an economic, process or quality assurance
advantage exists or where proprietary manufacturing techniques dictate internal
production processes.  Currently, most
products sold by the Company are manufactured at Company facilities.

The following
chart profiles the Company’s manufacturing facilities which are approximately
50,000 square feet or larger in size with ongoing production activities.

In general,
manufacturing facilities located in the United States serve the “United States
Cleaning & Sanitizing” segment and facilities located outside of the United
States serve the “International Cleaning & Sanitizing” segment.  However, certain of the United States
facilities do manufacture products for export and which are used by the
International segment.  The facilities
having export involvement are marked with an asterisk(*).

Guinea, People’s Republic of China, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Singapore,
Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Tanzania and Thailand. During 2002, the Company
leased manufacturing operations at its owned facilities located in North Kansas
City, Missouri, Woodbridge, New Jersey and Botany, Australia.

The Company believes its manufacturing facilities are
in good condition and are adequate to meet existing production needs.

Most of the
Company’s manufacturing plants also serve as distribution centers.  In addition, around the world, the Company
operates distribution centers, all of which are leased, and utilizes various
public warehouses to facilitate the distribution of its products and
services.  In the United States, Company
sales and service associates are located in approximately 109 leased offices.
Additional sales offices are located internationally.

The Company’s corporate headquarters is comprised of three
adjacent multi-storied buildings located in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.  The main 19-story building was constructed
to the Company’s specifications and is leased through 2008.  Thereafter, it is subject to multiple
renewals at the Company’s option.  The
second building is also subject to a long-term lease by the Company and the
third building is owned.  The corporate
headquarters includes a state-of-the-art training center.  The Company also owns a computer center in
St. Paul and a research facility located in a suburb of St. Paul.

Report of Independent Accountants

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Henkel-Ecolab:

In our opinion,
the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related combined statements of
income and comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Henkel-Ecolab at November 30,
2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.  In addition,
in our opinion, the accompanying financial statement schedule presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related combined financial statements.  These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Henkel-Ecolab (the “Company”) is a leading European company providing
total cleaning and hygiene systems and service solutions to institutional and
industrial companies. See Basis of Presentation within Note 2 of the combined
financial statements. The Company’s offerings include detergents, sanitation
cleaners, dosing and measuring equipment, cleaning machines, training and
service. Customers include hotels and restaurants; food service, healthcare and
educational facilities; commercial laundries; light industry; dairy plants and
farms as well as food and beverage processors throughout Europe.

The Company was formed in 1991 by Henkel KGaA (Henkel) and Ecolab, Inc.
(Ecolab) as a Company of their respective European institutional and industrial
hygiene businesses. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Company
Agreement dated June 26, 1991 (Company Agreement), Henkel and Ecolab have joint
control over the activities of the Company. The Company Agreement also provides
that both partners will share an equal economic interest in the profits or
losses of the Company. On December 1, 2001, Ecolab purchased Henkel´s share of
the Company. See note 10 of the combined financial statements.

Acquisitions
and Divestiture

The Company made certain acquisitions during the fiscal years ended
November 30, 2001 and 2000; the aggregate impact of which was immaterial to the
combined financial statements.

Waldhausen Divestiture

: In June
2000, the Company divested the assets of the Floordress textile and equipment
production facility in Waldhausen, Germany in two separate but related
transactions for a price equal to the net book value of approximately TEUR
2,249.  Inno Concept, the supplier of
plastics to the plant, assumed responsibility of the textile and equipment
production (including substantially all the employees and the current
production building for textiles).  The
Company also entered into a long-term supply agreement for textiles and
equipment with Inno Concept.Grupp, the metal supplier, purchased the equipment
production building in a real-estate transaction.  As both transactions were for a price equal to the net book
value, no gain or loss was recorded on the books for the sale of the assets
related to Waldhausen.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements are presented on a combined basis in
accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America. The Company is comprised of various entities. These entities
have varying legal structures, including stock corporations, limited liability
corporations and partnerships formed under the applicable laws in the
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These entities are owned
beneficially by identical shareholders or their wholly- owned subsidiaries and
are, therefore, considered entities under common control.  All significant intergroup or affiliated
company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in combination. The
Company’s fiscal year end has been designated as November 30.

Adoption of New Currency Reporting

Prior to 2001, the Company prepared and reported its combined financial
statements in Deutsche Marks (“DM”). Beginning in 2001, the Company presented
its combined financial statements in Euro (“EUR”). Accordingly figures for 2000
are shown in EUR using the Official Fixed Exchange Rate of 1 EUR = DM 1,95583.
Henkel-Ecolab’s 2000 Euro combined financial statements depict the same trends
as would have been presented if it had continued to present its Combined
Financial Statements in Deutsche Marks. The Company’s Combined Financial
Statements will however not be comparable to the Euro financial statements of
other companies that previously reported their financial information in a
currency other than Deutsche Marks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
determined using the first-in first-out and average cost methods.


Henkel-Ecolab

Notes to Combined Financial Statements

November
30, 2001 and 2000

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
Merchandising equipment consists primarily of various systems for dispensing
cleaning and sanitizing products. Depreciation and amortization are charged to
operations using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives:

Buildings and improvements

up to 50 years

Machinery and
  equipment

3 to 10 years

Furniture,
  fixtures and merchandising equipment

3 to 8 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the associated
lease. Betterments, renewals and repairs that extend the life of the asset are
capitalized; other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed. The cost and
accumulated depreciation/amortization applicable to the assets retired or
disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in
income in the year of disposal.

Total depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment amounted
to TEUR 37,766 and TEUR 35,753 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets primarily consist of goodwill, capitalized software,
concessions and licenses. These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated lives, periods from 3 to 15 years. Total amortization
expense for all intangible assets amounted to TEUR 8,676 and TEUR 8,245
for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company  capitalizes
purchased software which is ready for service and development costs incurred
during the application development stage. These costs are amortized using the
straight-line method over a maximum of three to five years or the expected life
of the product, whichever is less. The carrying value of capitalized software
costs are regularly reviewed by the Company and a loss is recognized if the
unamortized cost is in excess of the net realizable value.

Long-Lived Assets

The company periodically assesses the recoverability of long-lived and
intangible assets based on anticipated future earnings and operating cash
flows.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time title
transfers to the customer.  The Company
records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive
offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
incentives at the time of sale.

Shipping and Handling Costs

In connection with the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 00-10, “Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs”, the
Company has reclassified certain warehousing and transportation expenses from
Selling, General and Administrative expenses (“SG&A”) to Cost of Sales.
Amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2001
presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial position. 
Expenses reclassified from SG&A to Costs of Sales were TEUR 66,982
and TEUR 62,205 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The effect of the reclassification was to reduce gross margin by approximately
6.5 percentage points in each year and reduce SG&A as a percent of sales by
a comparable amount.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses the costs of advertising in the period in which
the costs are incurred. Advertising expenses were TEUR 21,696 and
TEUR 21,093 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Research expenditures

Research expenditures which relate to the development of new products
and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to existing
products, approximately TEUR 20,000 and TEUR 18,900 for the years ended
November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”, and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company will adopt
SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Upon
adoption, the Company will also perform the first of the required impairment
tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles as of December 1, 2001. The
Company has not yet determined what impact the adoption of these statements
will have on its results of operations and financial position.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” This statement requires entities to record the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which
the asset is placed in service. When the liability is initially recorded,
entities capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related
long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value
each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of
the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, entities either settle the
obligation for the recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement.
This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002,
with earlier adoption encouraged. The Company does not believe that the
adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its results of
operations or financial position.


Henkel-Ecolab

Notes to Combined Financial Statements

November
30, 2001 and 2000

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which replaces SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.” The
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all
long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting Results of Operations—Reporting
the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business,” for the disposal of
segments of a business. This statement requires that those long-lived assets be
measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell,
whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. As a
result, discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable
value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred. This
statement also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all
components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest
of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
entity in a disposal transaction. This statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company does not believe that the
adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its results of
operations or financial position.

Notes to Combined Financial Statements

November
30, 2001 and 2000

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company has entered into various contractual arrangements,
including those discussed in the following paragraphs, for the supply of
products, the performance of general and administrative services and the
transfer of technology.

Certain Company entities purchase institutional and industrial hygiene
products (primarily finished goods inventories) from Henkel and its
subsidiaries under a variety of supply agreements. The terms of these
agreements allow these entities to purchase specified quantities at agreed upon
prices as defined by an annual supply plan submitted to the related
manufacturing facility. Henkel also provides certain Company entities with
elective services which include, but are not limited to, general
administration, payroll administration, accounting and research and development.
The costs of services are charged by Henkel on a monthly basis and may not
reflect the costs which the Company would incur if it were necessary to procure
such services from outside sources or if such services were performed
internally by the Company. Related party purchases and fees incurred by the
Company in consideration for these services totaled TEUR 92,155 and TEUR 91,278
for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Royalty payments are shared equally by both parent companies based upon
a technology transfer agreement which provides for a royalty payment 1 % of
third party net sales as defined. Royalty expense related to this technology
transfer agreement amounted to TEUR 7,670 and TEUR 7,455 for the years ended
November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
The royalty agreement terminated effective December 1, 2001 when Ecolab
acquired the 50% of the Company owned by Henkel.

The Company has entered into agreements with Henkel under which the
Company can both borrow from and lend to Henkel both on an overdraft basis and
through short term loans of no more than 3 months. There is currently no
maximum level of borrowing specified under these agreements. The interest rate
basis for both arrangements is the Euro London Interbank Offering Rate
(EURO-LIBOR). At November 30, 2001, the interest rates were 4.875 % for EURO
overdrafts and 3.53 % for 3 month short term EURO loans. On overdrafts,
approximately 50 basis points are paid to compensate Henkel for administration
costs.  These agreements terminated
effective December 1, 2001 when Ecolab acquired the 50% of the Company owned by
Henkel

At November 30, 2000 the Company had loans receivable from Henkel and
its subsidiaries of TEUR 6,039. No loans remain outstanding as of November 30,
2001. The fair values of related party loans receivable and payable approximate
book value.

The Company incurs and expenses certain costs incurred on behalf of the
parents which by their nature are not arm’s length. The Company charges the
parents for these costs and has reflected the reimbursement of such costs, net
of tax, in the amount of TEUR 879 and TEUR 382 as contributed capital for the
years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000.

5. INCOME TAXES

The components of income before income taxes and the provision for
income taxes for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

The components
of the Company's overall net deferred tax asset at November 30:


Henkel-Ecolab

Notes to Combined Financial Statements

November
30, 2001 and 2000

At November 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had net foreign operating
loss carry forwards for tax purposes of approximately TEUR 6,868 and TEUR
5,010, respectively. A significant portion of these losses have an indefinite
carry forward period; the remaining losses have expiration dates up to five
years.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected
future taxable income in making this assessment. Based upon the level of
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the
periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is
more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible
differences at November 30, 2001 and 2000. During 2000 the valuation allowance
decreased by TEUR 694.

A reconciliation of the weighted average European effective tax rate to
the effective income tax rate is as follows:

The deferred taxes refundable to parent reflect the Company Agreement
in which the partners also agreed that all tax benefits realized after the
formation of the Company should be refunded to the respective parents if the
benefits relate to temporary differences that originated in periods prior to
the formation of the Company.

Cash paid for taxes for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 was
TEUR 27,317 and TEUR 31,822, respectively.

an additional pension liability adjustment 
of TEUR 7,161

,

and TEUR 2,290 as of November 30, 2001
and 2000, respectively, representing the amount by which the accumulated
benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accrued
pension liability for certain plans.

7. TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS

Short Term Debt

Short term debt of TEUR 28,832 and TEUR 6,845 at November 30, 2001 and
2000, respectively, consists primarily of short term credit facilities and bank
overdrafts. The weighted average interest rate on short term debt outstanding
(in all borrowing entities across Europe) was 4.45%

at November 30, 2001 and
6.0% at November 30, 2000.

At November 30, 2001, the Company had TEUR 71,996 available through
multiple bank lines of credit under which the Company may borrow on an
overdraft or short term basis. Interest rates are based on local money market
rates.

Long Term Debt

Long term debt at November 30, 2001 and 2000 consists of the following:

The note, which is denominated in Danish Kroni, has a fixed annual
interest rate of 10.07 % and is due June 30, 2002.

The fair value of short and long term debt approximates the book value.

8. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Financial risk factors

The Company´s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks,
including the effects of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.The
Company´s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of
financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the
financial performance of the Company. Henkel-Ecolab uses derivative financial
instruments such as foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain exposures.

Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group
Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group Treasury
identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the
operating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk
management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative
financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.

Foreign exchange risk

The Company operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange
risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the
currencies set out in the table below. The Company uses forward contracts,
transacted with Group Treasury, to hedge their exposure to foreign currency
risk in the local reporting currency. Group Treasury is responsible for hedging
the net position in each currency by using external forward contracts.

At the group level, external foreign exchange contracts are designated
as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future
transactions.

Since the Company has subsidiaries not accounting for the results of
their operations in Euro, the Euro denominated value of the equity of the
Company is also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The accounts of all foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are generally
measured using the local currency as the functional currency, except for two
countries where, due to hyperinflation, the functional currency has been
changed to the Company´s reporting currency. With the exception of the
hyperinflationary countries, assets and liabilities are translated into the
Company’s reporting currency, at period-end exchange rates. Income statement
accounts are translated to the reporting currency at the average rates of
exchange prevailing during the year.

Net unrealized exchange gains or losses resulting from such translation
are excluded from net earnings and accumulated in a separate component of
combined equity. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions
during the year and the translation adjustments from hyperinflationary
countries are included in the related income statement category. Total gains
and (losses) recognized for the year ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 were
(2,650) and 469, respectively.


Henkel-Ecolab

Notes to Combined Financial Statements

November

Notional Amounts and Credit Exposures
of Derivatives

The notional amounts of derivatives summarized below do not represent
amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the exposure
of the Company through its use of derivatives. The amounts exchanged are
calculated on the basis of the notional amounts and the other terms of the
derivatives, which relate to exchange rates.

Financial instruments contain an element of risk that the
counterparties may not be able to meet the terms of the agreement. However, the
Company minimises this risk by limiting its counterparties to major banks and
financial institutions. Direct credit risk represents the risk of loss from
counterparty default in relation to on-balance sheet products. Management does
not expect counterparties to default given their high credit ratings.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts in managing its
foreign exchange rate risks, as indicated in the following table:

The purpose of foreign exchange contracts purchased is to hedge various
intercompany loans and hedge certain existing and anticipated future net
foreign exchange exposures. The anticipated future foreign exchange exposure of
the Company is the total of the net balances of all known and planned incoming
and outgoing payments of the companies in foreign currencies during a twelve
month time horizon.

The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of
the Company´s forward exchange contracts in EURO. Foreign currency amounts are
translated at rates current at the reporting date. The “buy” amounts represent
the EURO equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the
“sell” amounts represent the EURO equivalent of commitments to sell foreign
currencies :

Interest rate risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk through changes in the
interest expense, which arises through interest bearing liabilities. Estimated
future changes in cash flows and balance sheet structure also expose the
Company to interest rate risk. The individual entities of the combined company
are responsible to manage their short term interest rate exposure through a
group cash management system. Long term interest rate exposure is monitored and
managed by Group Treasury.

Accounting for derivative financial
instruments and hedging activities

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the
balance sheet at cost and subsequently are remeasured at their fair value.

Generally derivative transactions entered into by the Company, while
providing effective economic hedges under the Company´s risk management
policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules in FAS
133. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not
qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 are recognised immediately in the
income statement.

Fair value estimation

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined
using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.

In assessing the fair value of non-traded derivatives and other
financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and makes
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet
date.

The face values less any estimated credit adjustments for financial
assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to
approximate their fair values.
