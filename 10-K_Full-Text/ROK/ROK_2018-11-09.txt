Item 1.

Business

General

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (“Rockwell Automation” or the “Company”),

a leader in industrial automation and information, makes its customers more productive and the world more sustainable

. Our hardware and software products, solutions and services are designed to meet our customers’ needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce enterprise business risk.

The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the



reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC.

As used herein, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, “Rockwell Automation” or the “Company” include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.

Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on

February 5, 2019

(the Proxy Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7.

Operating Segments

We have two operating segments: Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions. Both operating segments share a common sales organization and supply chain and conduct business globally. Major markets served by both segments consist of consumer industries, including food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences; transportation, including automotive and tire; and heavy industries, including oil and gas, mining, metals, and chemicals.

Geographic Information

We do business in more than 80 countries around the world.  The largest sales outside the United States on a country-of-destination basis are in China, Canada, Mexico, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil.  See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

for a discussion of risks associated with our global operations.

Competition

Our competitors range from large diversified corporations that may also have business interests outside of industrial automation to smaller companies that offer a limited portfolio of industrial automation products, solutions and services. Factors that influence our competitive position include the breadth of our product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology differentiation, domain expertise, installed base, distribution network, quality of hardware and software products, solutions and services, global presence and price. Major competitors include Siemens AG, ABB Ltd, Schneider Electric SA, Emerson Electric Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Honeywell International Inc.

Distribution

In most countries, we sell primarily through independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. In other countries, we sell through a combination of our direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through independent distributors. Approximately

75 percent

of our global sales are through independent distributors. Sales to our largest distributor in


,


and


were approximately

10 percent

of our total sales.

Employees

At

September 30, 2018

, we had

approximately

23,000

employees. Approximately

8,600

were employed in the United States.

Raw Materials

We purchase a wide range of equipment, components, finished products and materials used in our business. The raw materials essential to the manufacture of our products generally are available at competitive prices. We have a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors. We depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. These risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. Our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on the Company only to a limited extent.

A team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and reviews significant identified risks. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. Our other Board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.

Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. However, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.

Adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability.

We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced, canceled or delayed orders, payment delays or defaults, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.

Demand for our hardware and software products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve. As economic activity slows, credit markets tighten, or sovereign debt concerns arise, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, which could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions. If our access to credit, including the commercial paper market, is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise, our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced.

We sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries.

We do business in more than


countries around the world. Approximately

45 percent

of our sales in


were to customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world. The future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in non-U.S. markets. Our global operations are subject to numerous financial, legal and operating risks, such as political and economic instability; prevalence of corruption in certain countries; enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights; and compliance with existing and future laws, regulations and policies, including those related to exports, imports, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions, investments, taxation, product content and performance, employment and repatriation of earnings. In addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates. The occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more difficult to operate our business and increase our costs, which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

An inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation, and the development process is often lengthy and costly. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends, demand for our products could decline.



We rely on suppliers to provide equipment, components and services.

Our business requires that we buy equipment, components and services including finished products, electronic components and commodities. Our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks, including:

•

poor quality or an insecure supply chain, which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our hardware and software products;

•

changes in the cost of these purchases due to inflation, exchange rate fluctuations, taxes, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions, commodity market volatility or other factors that affect our suppliers;

•

intellectual property risks such as challenges to ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliers; and

•

shortages of components, commodities or other materials, which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery of our products, solutions and services.

Any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete. We also maintain several single-source supplier relationships, because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. Unavailability of, or delivery delays for single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products. Even where substitute sources of supply are available, qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales.

Failures or security breaches of our products, connected services, manufacturing environment, supply chain, or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business.

We rely heavily on information technology (IT) in our hardware and software products, solutions and services for customers, manufacturing environment, and in our enterprise IT infrastructure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states, hackers, cyber-criminals, malicious insiders, and other actors who may engage in fraud, theft of confidential or proprietary information, or sabotage. These systems could be compromised by malware (including ransomware), cyber attacks, and other events, ranging from widespread, non-targeted, global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats. Given that our hardware and software products and services are used in critical infrastructure, these threats could indicate increased risk for our products, services, manufacturing, and IT infrastructure.  Recent global cyber attacks have been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widely-used software products, increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products. In some cases, malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain, moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections.

Our hardware and software products, solutions, and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft, tampering, or sabotage. Careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property. While we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products, solutions and services, we can reduce risk, not eliminate it. To a significant extent, the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed, installed, protected, configured, updated and monitored, much of which are typically outside our control.

Our business uses IT resources on a dispersed, global basis for a wide variety of functions including development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, accounting, and human resources. Our vendors, partners, employees and customers have access to, and share, information across multiple locations via various digital technologies.  In addition, we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities, including cloud providers, are part of our internal IT infrastructure and our commercial offerings. Secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations. Also, our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers, employees, and others. We design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners’ infrastructure, for example a cloud platform, could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks, but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business.

The current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies, including those in industrial automation and information. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  Our information security efforts, under the leadership of our Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Product Security Officer, with the support of the entire management team, include major programs designed to address security governance, product security, identification and protection of critical assets, insider risk, third-party risk, and cyber defense operations. We believe these measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of an information



security incident.  Any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns.

There are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses.

Risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification, including defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing projects, and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers. If we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, we could incur cost overruns, liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect

our results of operations.

New legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business.

Legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business.  For example, we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material, product, certification and labeling laws and regulations. Our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements. These requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services. Compliance with increasing privacy regulation, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. Failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm.

Our industry is highly competitive.

We face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects. We compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings, technology differentiation, the domain expertise of our employees and partners, product performance, quality of our hardware and software products, solutions and services, knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges, pricing, delivery and customer service. The relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments. We seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems. In addition, we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure. If we fail to achieve our objectives, to keep pace with technological changes, or to provide high quality hardware and software products, solutions and services, we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins. We expect the level of competition to remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.

We rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales.

In the United States and Canada, a large percentage of our sales are through distributors. In certain other countries, the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors. We depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products and services and deliver value to our customers. Disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products and services could adversely affect our sales. A disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of a distributor or other events.

We face the potential harms of natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.

Our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world.  Natural disasters, pandemics, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, power outages, fires, explosions, equipment failures, sabotage, political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create economic instability. Disruptions to our IT infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions at third party IT and other service providers, could also interfere with or disrupt our operations. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products, solutions or services, increase our costs, or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, solutions or services.



Intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.

Others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. We frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. Indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly.

In addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business. The inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant.

Claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition.

We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. We must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Our business success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified personnel.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. Difficulty attracting, developing, and retaining members of our management team and key employees, including employees with the necessary technological expertise, could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims and environmental remediation) could reduce our profitability.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products, solutions and services we sell, employment, contract matters, and environmental remediation.

We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago. Our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities, which could result in product liability claims. The uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution.

Our operations are subject to various environmental regulations that are concerned with human health, the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground, and water, the quality of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances. Our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals, as well as properties that we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. We have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.



Failure to identify, manage, complete, and integrate acquisitions and technology investments may adversely affect our business.

As part of our strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of or investment opportunities in businesses as well as the purchase of technology from third parties. In order to be successful with these transactions, we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, successfully complete the transaction, and manage post-closing matters, such as integration of the acquired business or technology. We may not be able to identify or complete beneficial acquisition or transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them. Even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions, we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions, including:

•

difficulties in integrating the purchased operations, technologies, products or services, retaining the acquired business’ customers and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as sales increases, access to technologies, cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired time frames;

•

loss of key employees of the acquired business;

•

legal and compliance issues;

•

difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and

•

diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.

Future acquisitions and technology investments could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges, and impairment and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.

We own common stock in PTC Inc. and are exposed to the volatility, liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock.

We own common stock of PTC Inc. (PTC), a Nasdaq-listed company, that we acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion. We present this investment on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period, less a valuation adjustment pending registration of our shares of PTC common stock (Shares) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which, per a registration rights agreement entered into with PTC, must occur no later than July 19, 2019. The fair value of the Shares is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market, changes in general economic conditions, and  the  performance of PTC. We will recognize all changes in the fair value of the Shares (whether realized or unrealized) as gains or losses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the Shares can materially impact the earnings we report, which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations. In particular, significant declines in the fair value of the Shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings.

While there is an established trading market for shares of PTC common stock, there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the Shares should we wish to reduce our investment. Until approximately July 19, 2021, we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the Shares, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the Shares under the securities laws. Further, the reported value of our Shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price. If we were forced to sell some or all the Shares in the market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the Shares that we have reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.

Finally, our equity position in PTC is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over PTC.

Increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.

One important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits. The expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates, the value of plan assets, mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates.  Significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses.  Expenses related to employer-funded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations, which could change, as well as healthcare cost inflation.  An inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

our customers’ needs for faster time to market, lower total cost of ownership, improved asset utilization and optimization, and enterprise risk management;

•

our customers’ needs to continuously improve quality, safety and sustainability;

•

industry factors that include our customers’ new product introductions, demand for our customers’ products or services and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate;

•

levels of global industrial production and capacity utilization;

•

regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic circumstances; and

•

the spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedules.

Long-term Strategy

Our strategy is to bring The Connected Enterprise to life. We integrate control and information across the enterprise to help industrial companies and their people be more productive. Our vision of being the most valued global provider of innovative industrial automation and information hardware and software products, solutions and services is supported by our growth and performance strategy, which seeks to:

•

achieve organic sales growth in excess of the automation market by expanding our served market and strengthening our competitive differentiation;

•

diversify our sales streams by broadening our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services, expanding our global presence and serving a wider range of industries and applications;

•

grow market share by gaining new customers and by capturing a larger share of existing customers’ spending;

•

enhance our market access by building our channel capability and partner network;

•

acquire companies that serve as catalysts to organic growth by adding complementary technology, expanding our served market, or enhancing our domain expertise or market access;

•

deploy human and financial resources to strengthen our technology leadership and our intellectual capital business model;

•

continuously improve quality and customer experience; and

•

drive annual cost productivity.

By implementing the above strategy, we seek to achieve our long-term financial goals, including above-market organic sales growth, EPS growth above sales growth, return on invested capital in excess of 20 percent and free cash flow equal to about 100 percent of Adjusted Income. We expect acquisitions to add a percentage point or more per year to long-term sales growth.



Our customers face the challenge of remaining globally cost competitive and automation can help them achieve their productivity and sustainability objectives. Our value proposition is to help our customers reduce time to market, lower total cost of ownership, improve asset utilization and manage enterprise risks.

Differentiation through Technology Innovation and Domain Expertise

We seek a technology leadership position in industrial automation. We believe that our three platforms - integrated architecture, intelligent motor control and solutions and services - provide the foundation for a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.

Our integrated control and information architecture, with Logix at its core, is an important differentiator. We are the only automation provider that can support discrete, process, batch, safety, motion and power control on the same hardware platform with the same software programming environment.  Our integrated architecture is scalable with standard open communications protocols making it easier for customers to implement it more cost effectively. Our software portfolio, combined with the software made available as a result of our strategic alliance with PTC, is the most comprehensive and flexible information platform in the industry.  Through the combination of this technology and our domain expertise we help customers to achieve additional productivity benefits, such as reduced unplanned downtime, improved energy efficiency, higher quality and increased throughput yield.

Intelligent motor control is one of our core competencies and an important aspect of an automation system. These products and solutions enhance the availability, efficiency and safe operation of our customers' critical and most energy-intensive plant assets.  Our intelligent motor control offering can be integrated seamlessly with the Logix architecture.

Domain expertise refers to the industry and application knowledge required to deliver solutions and services that support customers through the entire life cycle of their automation investment.  The combination of industry-specific domain expertise of our people with our innovative technologies enables us to help our customers solve their manufacturing and business challenges.

Global Expansion

As the manufacturing world continues to expand, we must be able to meet our customers’ needs around the world. Approximately

60 percent

of our employees and

45 percent

of our sales are outside the U.S. We continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets.

As we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions. We have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing, product development and customer-facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world. The emerging markets of Asia Pacific, including China and India, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa are projected to be the fastest growing over the long term, due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middle-class population. We believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.

Enhanced Market Access

Over the past decade, our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to over $90 billion. Our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity. Logix is the technology foundation that enabled us to become an industry leader for process applications. We complement that with a growing global network of engineers and partners to provide solutions to process customers.

Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) represent another area of addressed market expansion and an important growth opportunity. To remain competitive, OEMs need to find the optimal balance of machine cost and performance while reducing their time to market. Our scalable integrated architecture and intelligent motor control offerings, along with design productivity tools and our motion and safety products, can assist OEMs in addressing these business needs.

We have developed a powerful network of channel partners, technology partners and commercial partners that act as amplifiers to our internal capabilities and enable us to serve our customers’ needs around the world.



Broad Range of Industries Served

We apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges. We serve customers in a wide range of industries, including consumer products, heavy industries and transportation.

Our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage, home and personal care, and life sciences industries. These customers’ needs include new capacity, incremental capacity from existing facilities, flexible manufacturing and regulatory compliance. These customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors.

We serve customers in heavy industries, including oil and gas, mining, aggregates, cement, metals, energy, semiconductor, chemicals, pulp and paper and water/wastewater. Companies in resource-based industries typically invest in capacity expansion when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is increasing. In addition, there is ongoing investment in upgrades of aging automation systems and productivity.

In the transportation industry, factors such as geographic expansion, investment in new model introductions, including electric vehicles, and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers’ automation investment decisions. Our sales in transportation are primarily to automotive and tire manufacturers.

All of these industries also generate maintenance repair order (MRO) and ongoing services revenue related to the installed base.

Outsourcing and Sustainability Trends

Demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers. Customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base. Our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally.

We help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency, environmental and safety goals. Customers across all industries are investing in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor control, and energy-efficient solutions and services. In addition, environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices.

Acquisitions and Investments

Our acquisition and investment strategy focuses on hardware and software products, solutions and services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings.

In 2018, we made several investments, including in PTC. PTC is the leader in the Industrial Internet of Things and augmented reality. Our investment in and alliance with PTC will accelerate growth for both companies and enable us to be the partner of choice for customers around the world who want to transform their physical operations with digital technology. The result will be an unmatched integrated information solution that will enable customers to achieve increased productivity, heightened plant efficiency, reduced operational risk and better system interoperability.

In November 2017, we acquired Odos Imaging Limited, a Scottish technology company that provides three-dimensional, time-of-flight sensing systems for industrial imaging applications. This acquisition enables us to expand our existing capabilities by bringing 3-D time-of-flight sensor technology to industrial applications.

In September 2016, we acquired Maverick Technologies, a leading systems integrator. This acquisition significantly enhances our expertise in key process and batch applications that help our customers realize greater productivity and improved global competitiveness through process control and information management solutions.

In September 2016, we acquired Automation Control Products, a premier provider in centralized thin client, remote desktop and server management software. This acquisition strengthens our ability to provide our customers with visual display and software solutions to manage information and streamline workflows for a more connected manufacturing environment.

In March 2016, we acquired MagneMotion Inc., a leading manufacturer of intelligent conveying systems. This acquisition continues our strategy to build a portfolio of smart manufacturing technologies by expanding our existing capabilities in independent cart technology.

We believe these acquisitions and investments will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers.



Continuous Improvement

Productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture. We have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement, functional streamlining, material cost savings and manufacturing productivity. Our implementation of common global processes and an enterprise-wide business system is nearly complete. These are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation. Our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization. Charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs.



U. S. Industrial Economic Trends

In


, sales in the U.S. accounted for approximately


percent of our total sales. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served U.S. markets include:

•

The Industrial Production (IP) Index, published by the Federal Reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The IP Index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2012. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the IP Index and the level of automation investment made by our U.S. customers in their manufacturing base.

•

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which indicates the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.

•

Industrial Equipment Spending, compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy. This measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a reasonable correlation with our domestic growth.

•

Capacity Utilization (Total Industry), published by the Federal Reserve, which measures plant operating activity. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between Capacity Utilization and levels of U.S. IP.

The table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal


to


. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, all indicators, except PMI, improved compared to the prior quarter and the same quarter in the prior year. PMI decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter and the same quarter in the prior year, but continues to be significantly above 50.

Note: Economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations.



Non-U.S. Economic Trends

In


, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately

45 percent

of our total sales. These customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence. In addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “Overview” section, international demand, particularly in emerging markets, has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region, investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets. We use changes in the respective countries' gross domestic product and IP as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business.

Macroeconomic indicators remain favorable in most geographies, although IP and gross domestic product growth rates are projected to slow in 2019. In China, the impact of trade tensions is expected to be partially offset by government stimulus, and solid domestic and foreign demand in India is expected to help support continued manufacturing growth. In Europe, the economy is affected by slowing export growth driven by a strong Euro against emerging market currencies and increasing oil prices. Latin America is expected to continue to benefit from a strong U.S. economy. Growth rates in Canada are expected to be lower in 2019.

The following table reflects our sales and operating results (in millions, except per share amounts):

(1)

See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for the definition of segment operating earnings.

(2)

Total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, general corporate – net, non-operating pension costs, costs related to the unsolicited Emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, gains and losses on investments, valuation adjustment pending registration of PTC Shares, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses, interest expense and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. We believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.

(3)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold a product distribution business within our Control Products & Solutions segment. This business held no intellectual property and included products sold outside of our core channel and under different brands. We sold this business for approximately $94 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $60.8 million, which is included within Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

(4)

During fiscal 2018, we recorded charges of $538.3 million associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 14 in the Financial Statements for further information.

(5)

Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP earnings measure that excludes non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. See

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation

for more information on this non-GAAP measure.



Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and non-operating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment's operating performance for internal purposes. If we were to allocate these costs, we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows (in millions):

The decreases in non-operating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2018 were primarily due to a $200 million voluntary contribution in fiscal 2017 and other actuarial adjustments. The increases in non-operating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the decrease in our U.S. discount rate from 4.55 percent for fiscal 2016 to 3.75 percent for fiscal 2017.

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension costs, costs related to the unsolicited Emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, gains and losses on investments, and valuation adjustments pending registration of PTC Shares, including their respective tax effects, and the provisional effects of the Tax Act.

We believe that Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Adjusted EPS is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measures of Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations, diluted EPS and effective tax rate.

Non-operating pension costs include defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements. These components of net periodic pension cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these and other excluded costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business.

The following are the components of operating and non-operating pension costs (in millions):



The following are reconciliations of income from continuing operations, diluted EPS from continuing operations and effective tax rate to Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, respectively (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):


Includes gain on investments and valuation adjustment pending registration of PTC Shares and the related tax effects.


The Tax Act may require further adjustments as additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury is provided, the Company’s assumptions change, or as further information and interpretations become available. Refer to Note 14 in the Financial Statements for further information.

Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from U.S. tax ("transition tax"). As a fiscal year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Act impact us in fiscal year 2018, including the change in the federal statutory rate and the transition tax, while other provisions will be effective in fiscal year 2019, including the tax on global intangible low-tax income ("GILTI") of foreign subsidiaries, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income ("FDII"), and the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction.

The effective tax rate in


was

59.8 percent

compared to

20.4 percent

in


. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to provisional expense related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings ($395.8 million or 29.8 percent), withholding taxes on previously taxed foreign earnings ($38.1 million or 2.8 percent), and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets ($104.4 million or 7.9 percent).

The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate in


was

19.3 percent

compared to

21.5 percent

in


. The decrease in the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate was primarily due to the lower U.S. statutory tax rate under the Tax Act partially offset by lower discrete tax items in the current year.

Cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations, if any. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations, if any, are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted a new share-based compensation accounting standard that requires the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation to be classified as an operating, rather than as a financing, cash flow. In previous periods, we added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, no adjustment is necessary as this benefit is already included in operating cash flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.

Cash provided by operating activities was

$1,300.0 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2018

compared to

$1,034.0 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2017

. Free cash flow was

$1,174.5 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2018

compared to

$892.3 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2017

. The year-over-year increases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to a voluntary contribution of $200.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2017.

We repurchased approximately

8.3 million

shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in


at a total cost of

$1.5 billion

. In


, we repurchased approximately

2.3 million

shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of

$336.6 million

. At

September 30, 2018

, there were

$18.3 million

of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until


.  At

September 30, 2017

, there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until


. Our decision to repurchase shares in


will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price.  On both January 15, 2018 and September 6, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized us to expend an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock.  At

September 30, 2018

, we had approximately

$1,108.4 million

remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations. See Part II, Item 5.

Market for the Company’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

, for additional information regarding share repurchases.



During fiscal 2018, we repatriated approximately $2.3 billion to the U.S. from our foreign subsidiaries. The repatriated funds were primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock and fund the investment in PTC. The source of these funds was cash and cash equivalents and from the liquidation of short and long-term investments.

At September 30, 2018, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and investments (funds) were held by non-US subsidiaries. Due to the enactment of the Tax Act in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our previously undistributed foreign earnings were subject to a transition tax of approximately $389.4 million. Accordingly, these funds will not be subject to further U.S. tax if repatriated. Refer to Note 14 in the Financial Statements for further information regarding the effect of the enactment of the Tax Act on our financial condition and results of operations.

We expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our retirement plans, acquisitions of businesses, dividends to shareowners, repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt. We expect capital expenditures in


to be about

$150 million

. We expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term investments, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities.

In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our short-term debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

$550.0 million

at

September 30, 2018

, with a weighted average interest rate of

2.27 percent

and weighted average maturity period of


days. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

$350.0 million

at

September 30, 2017

, with a weighted average interest rate of

1.26 percent

and weighted average maturity period of


days.

At

September 30, 2018

and


, our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in March 2020 was

$1.0 billion

. We can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to

$350.0 million

, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility. We have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended

September 30, 2018

or


. In December 2016, we amended the financial covenant under this credit facility. The previous financial covenant, which limited our debt-to-total-capital ratio to 60 percent, was replaced with a minimum EBITDA-to-interest ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. The EBITDA-to-interest ratio is defined in the amendment as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the amendment) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period. We believe the new covenant provides us greater financial flexibility. Separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately

$156.0 million

at

September 30, 2018

were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Borrowings under our non-U.S. credit facilities at

September 30, 2018

and

September 30, 2017

were not significant. We were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at

September 30, 2018

and

September 30, 2017

. Additional information related to our credit facilities is included in Note 5 in the Financial Statements.

Among other uses, we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the short-term credit ratings set forth in the table below. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.

The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of

September 30, 2018

:

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions. We have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.



We regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. We also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. In addition, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities' functional currencies. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.

Cash dividends to shareowners were

$440.8 million

in


(

$3.51

per common share),

$390.7 million

in


(

$3.04

per common share) and

$378.2 million

(

$2.90

per common share). Our quarterly dividend rate as of

September 30, 2018

is

$0.92

per common share (

$3.68

per common share annually), which is determined at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.

A summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at

September 30, 2018

is as follows (in millions):

(a)

The amounts for long-term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. The amounts include interest but exclude the amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap contracts, including the

$24.0 million

fair value adjustment recorded for the interest rate swap contracts at

September 30, 2018

and the unamortized discount of

$44.6 million

at

September 30, 2018

. See Note 5 in the Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt.

(b)

Our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and are subject to change. Amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.

(c)

Amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates of known commitments. Contributions to our pension plans beyond


will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time. Amounts subsequent to


are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of these amounts. The minimum contribution for our U.S. pension plan as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is currently zero. We may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management.

(d)

This item includes contractual commitments for capital expenditures, certain materials purchases and long-term obligations under agreements with various service providers.



(e)

Other long-term liabilities include environmental remediation costs, conditional asset retirement obligations and indemnification liabilities. Amounts subsequent to


are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities will be paid.

(f)

Under the Tax Act, the Company may elect to pay the transition tax interest-free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. See Note 14 in the Financial Statements for further discussion of the transition tax.

(g)

Amount for unrecognized tax benefits includes accrued interest and penalties. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or paid.

Supplemental Sales Information

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales (in millions):

Critical Accounting Estimates

We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. These estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions, but actual results could differ from those estimates. Refer to Note 1 in the Financial Statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies.

Retirement Benefits — Pension

Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods.

Our global pension expense in


was

$114.1 million

compared to

$175.9 million

in


. Approximately

79 percent

of our


global pension expense relates to our U.S. pension plan. The actuarial assumptions used to determine our


U.S. pension expense included the following: discount rate of

3.90 percent

(compared to

3.75 percent

for


) and expected rate of return on plan assets of

7.50 percent

(consistent with


).

For


our U.S. discount rate will increase to

4.35 percent

from

3.90 percent

in


. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans.

For 2019 our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets will remain

7.50 percent

. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets. We also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. The financial markets produced positive returns in


. The plan’s debt securities return was positive. The plan’s equity securities return was above the expected return range in


, as U.S. and international equity returns were positive for the year. The actual return for our portfolio of U.S. plan assets was approximately

7.88 percent

annualized for the 15 years ended

September 30, 2018

, and was approximately

7.46 percent

annualized for the 20 years ended

September 30, 2018

.

The target allocations and ranges of long-term expected return for our major categories of U.S. plan assets are as follows:

The changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost. The change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation.

The following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):

(1)

Change includes both operating and non-operating pension costs.

More information regarding pension benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements.



Revenue Recognition

—

Customer Incentives

We offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional hardware and software products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria.  Customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Customer incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional hardware and software products, solutions and services to be provided. We record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within Customer returns, rebates and incentives in our Consolidated Balance Sheet or, where a right of setoff exists, as a reduction of Receivables.

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. Our estimate is based primarily on historical experience. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately

$12.0 million

.

More information regarding our revenue recognition and returns, rebates and incentives policies are contained in Note 1 in the Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 in the Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of

$22.0 million

and a liability of

$7.2 million

at

September 30, 2018

. We enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In


, the relative weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our sales and results of operations. In


, the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations. While future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to


levels.

Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. For such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts, a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pre-tax income by approximately

$21.0 million

.

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. The use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately. There was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in


or


. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk

In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.

Our short-term debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

$550.0 million

at

September 30, 2018

, with a weighted average interest rate of

2.27 percent

and weighted average maturity period of


days.  Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

$350.0 million

at

September 30, 2017

, with a weighted average interest rate of

1.26 percent

and weighted average maturity period of


days. We have issued, and anticipate continuing to issue, additional short-term commercial paper obligations as needed. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our short-term debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition.

We had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with a carrying value of

$1,225.2 million

at

September 30, 2018

and

$1,243.4 million

at

September 30, 2017

. The fair value of this debt was

$1,391.3 million

at

September 30, 2018

and

$1,452.6 million

at

September 30, 2017

. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity.

In February 2015, we entered into interest rate swap contracts, which we designated as fair value hedges.  These interest rate swaps effectively converted the

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount of our

2.050 percent

notes payable in March 2020 (2020 Notes) and

2.875 percent

notes payable in March 2025 (2025 Notes) to floating rate debt, each at a rate based on three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The effective floating interest rates were

2.759 percent

for the 2020 Notes and

3.169 percent

for the 2025 Notes at

September 30, 2018

.  The fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at

September 30, 2018

was a net unrealized

loss

of

$24.0 million

.  A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our interest rate swaps would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (“Rockwell Automation” or “the Company”),

a leader in industrial automation and information, makes its customers more productive and the world more sustainable

.

Basis of Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have control but exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the aggregate to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete inventory; discount valuation of PTC Inc. ("PTC") common stock; share-based compensation; acquisitions; product warranty obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters, conditional asset retirement obligations and contractual indemnifications; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions prospectively when warranted by factually-based experience.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Product and solution sales consist of industrial automation and information solutions; hardware and software products; and custom-engineered systems. Service sales include multi-vendor customer technical support and repair, asset management and optimization consulting and training. All service sales recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations are associated with our Control Products & Solutions segment.

For approximately

85 percent

of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and hardware and software products have been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.  Within this category, we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple hardware and software products and/or the performance of services, such as installation and commissioning.  The timing of delivery, though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component, is generally short-term in nature.  For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that element's relative selling price, provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control.  Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on our separate selling price for that or a similar item, or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.  If such evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of accounting.  We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others.  Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion.  Under the percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified.  We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (Continued)

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of a sales agreement. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional hardware and software products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional hardware and software products, solutions and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet or, where a right of setoff exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable.

Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions

Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales, value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenue).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and other fixed income securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Receivables

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of

$17.1 million

at

September 30, 2018

and

$24.9 million

at

September 30, 2017

. In addition, receivables are recorded net of an allowance for certain customer returns, rebates and incentives of

$8.7 million

at

September 30, 2018

and

$11.9 million

at

September 30, 2017

.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.

Investments

Investments include time deposits, certificates of deposit, other fixed income securities and equity securities. Investments with original maturities longer than three months at the time of purchase and less than one year from period end are classified as short-term. All other investments are classified as long-term. Fixed income securities meeting the definition of a security are accounted for as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Equity securities are recorded at fair value. All other investments are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Property

Property, including internal-use software, is recorded at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line method over


to

40 years

for buildings and improvements,


to

20 years

for machinery and equipment and


to

10 years

for computer hardware and internal-use software. We capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off replaced units. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts. Property acquired during the year that is accrued within accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end is considered to be a non-cash investing activity and is excluded from cash used for capital expenditures in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Capital expenditures of

$43.2 million

,

$29.6 million

and

$29.9 million

were accrued within accounts payable and other current liabilities at

September 30, 2018

,


and


, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (Continued)

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as goodwill.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may be present. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We perform our annual impairment test during the second quarter of our fiscal year.

We amortize certain customer relationships on an accelerated basis over the period of which we expect the intangible asset to generate future cash flows. We amortize all other intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives assigned range from


to

15 years

for trademarks,


to

20 years

for customer relationships,


to

17 years

for technology and


to

30 years

for other intangible assets.

Intangible assets also include costs of software developed or purchased by our software business to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. Amortization of these computer software products is calculated on a product-by-product basis as the greater of (a) the unamortized cost at the beginning of the year times the ratio of the current year gross revenue for a product to the total of the current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or (b) the straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. We also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts to manage our borrowing costs of certain long-term debt. We designate and account for these derivative financial instruments as hedges under U.S. GAAP.

Furthermore, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities' functional currencies. It is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We record various financial instruments recorded at fair value. U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. U.S. GAAP also classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

We hold financial instruments consisting of cash and short-term debt. The fair values of our cash and short-term debt approximate their carrying amounts as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

We also hold financial instruments consisting of long-term debt, investments and derivatives. The valuation methodologies for these financial instruments are described in Notes 5, 8, 9, and 12 in the Financial Statements. The methods described in these Notes may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Currency transaction gains and losses are included in results of operations in the period incurred.

Research and Development Expenses

We expense research and development (R&D) costs as incurred; these costs were

$371.8 million

in


,

$348.2 million

in


and

$319.3 million

in


. We include R&D expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We account for uncertain tax positions by determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements based on our assertion of the most likely outcome resulting from an examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.

Earnings Per Share

We present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareowners, which is income excluding the allocation to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested restricted stock. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common-equivalent shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding share-based compensation awards, which requires us to compute total employee proceeds as the sum of the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award and the amount of unearned share-based compensation costs attributed to future services. Share-based compensation awards for which the total employee proceeds of the award exceed the average market price of the same award over the period have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation awards for the years ended

September 30, 2018

(

0.9 million

shares),


(

0.7 million

shares) and


(

2.2 million

shares) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation. U.S. GAAP requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, to be treated as participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Our participating securities are composed of unvested restricted stock and non-employee director restricted stock units.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (Continued)

The following table reconciles basic and diluted EPS amounts (in millions, except per share amounts):

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize share-based compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date.

Product and Workers’ Compensation Liabilities

We record accruals for product and workers’ compensation claims in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability and workers’ compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued.

Environmental Matters

We record liabilities for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  We make changes to the liabilities in the periods in which the estimated costs of remediation change. At third-party environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site, as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists, we record the liability net of the estimated recovery. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery. At environmental sites where we are the sole responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. Ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period. Our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing and/or amount of future cash payments.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We record liabilities for costs related to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible, long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2017, the FASB issued a new standard regarding the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs. This standard requires the service cost component to be reported in the income statement in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the related employees during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component in either a separate line item or within another appropriate line item with disclosure of where those costs are recorded. This standard also requires that only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. This standard is effective for us for reporting periods starting October 1, 2018 and will be applied retrospectively. The non-service components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost, which are to be reclassified to other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations upon adoption of the new standard, are expense of

$23.8 million

,

$77.6 million

and

$67.8 million

for the years ended

September 30, 2018

,


and


, respectively.

In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard on accounting for leases that requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases, among other changes to existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about leasing activities. This standard is effective for us for reporting periods beginning October 1, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard on revenue recognition related to contracts with customers. This standard supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance and involves a five-step principles-based approach to recognizing revenue. The underlying principle is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The new standard will also require additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments made in applying the revenue-guidance, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. We adopted the new revenue standard, using the modified retrospective transition method, which results in an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of October 1, 2018, our adoption date. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting the new standard is an increase in the opening balance sheet retained earnings of less than

$10 million

. The primary drivers of the impact were changes from the capitalization and deferral of certain contract costs and the timing of revenue, net of costs, for software licenses bundled with services and projects previously accounted for on a completed contract basis.  These were partially offset by a deferral of revenue, net of costs, related to the allocation of revenue to hardware and software products and services provided to our customers free of charge as incentives. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of revenues in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

In February 2015, upon issuance of our notes payable in March 2020 (2020 Notes) and March 2025 (2025 Notes), we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts with multiple banks that effectively converted the

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount to floating rate debt, each at a rate based on three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The effective floating interest rates were

2.759 percent

for the 2020 Notes and

3.169 percent

for the 2025 Notes at

September 30, 2018

, our total borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in

March 2020

was

$1.0 billion

$350.0 million

, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility.  We have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended

September 30, 2018

or


.  Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding.  In December 2016, we amended the financial covenant under this credit facility. The previous financial covenant, which limited our debt-to-total-capital ratio to

60 percent

, was replaced with a minimum EBITDA-to-interest ratio of

3.0

to 1.0. The EBITDA-to-interest ratio is defined in the amendment as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the amendment) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period. We believe the new covenant provides us greater financial flexibility. Separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately

$156.0 million

at

September 30, 2018

were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Borrowings under our non-U.S. credit facilities at

We base the fair value of long-term debt upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and therefore consider this a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of long-term debt considers the terms of the debt excluding the impact of derivative and hedging activity. The carrying amount of a portion of our long-term debt is impacted by fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts that are designated as fair value hedges. Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy.

8. Investments

Our investments consist of (in millions):

We record investments in fixed income and equity securities, classified as available-for-sale investments or trading investments, at fair value.

Available-for-sale Investments

We invest in certificates of deposit, time deposits, commercial paper and other fixed income securities which are classified as available-for-sale. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of any deferred taxes. Realized gains and losses are included in net income.

Our available-for-sale investments consist of (in millions):

Pre-tax gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments were

no

outstanding purchases of available-for-sale investments recorded in accounts payable.

We evaluated all available-for-sale investments for which the fair value was less than amortized cost for impairment on an individual security basis at

September 30, 2018

. This assessment included consideration of our intent and ability to hold the security and the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

credit risks specific to each security. We determined that the declines in fair value of these investments were not other than temporary as of

September 30, 2018

, and accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges in net income.

The table below summarizes the contractual maturities of our investments as of

September 30, 2018

(in millions). Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities below as borrowers may have the right to prepay certain obligations.

Classification of our available-for-sale investments as current or noncurrent is based on the nature of the investment and when the investment is reasonably expected to be realized. These investments were included in the following line items within the Consolidated Balance Sheet (in millions):

Trading Investments

On July 19, 2018, we purchased

10,582,010

shares of PTC common stock (the "PTC Shares") in a private placement at a purchase price of

$94.50

per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately

$1.0 billion

("the Purchase"). The PTC Shares are considered equity securities. For a period of approximately

3 years

after the Purchase we are subject to entity-specific transfer restrictions subject to certain exceptions. Following the first anniversary of the Purchase, the Company will be allowed to transfer, in the aggregate in any


-day period, a number of Shares equal to up to

1.0%

of PTC's total outstanding shares of common stock as of the first day in such


-day period, but no more than

2.0%

of PTC's total outstanding shares of common stock in each of the second year and the third year after the Purchase.

The PTC Shares were recorded at fair value and classified as trading securities. At

September 30, 2018

, the fair value of the PTC Shares was

$1,090.0 million

, which was recorded in long-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the year ended

September 30, 2018

, a gain of

$90.0 million

related to the PTC Shares was recorded in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. At

September 30, 2018

, the PTC Shares were valued using the most recent closing price of PTC common stock quoted on Nasdaq, resulting in a gain of

$123.7 million

, less a temporary discount for lack of marketability calculated using a put-option model, resulting in a loss of

$33.7 million

. The marketability discount is due to an instrument-specific restriction as the PTC Shares were issued to the Company in a private placement and are not currently registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, the PTC Shares are contractually required to be registered by PTC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, within one year, at which time the discount will be reversed.

Fair Value of Investments

We recognize all available-for-sale and trading investments at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation methodologies used for our investments measured at fair value are described below.

Certificates of deposit and time deposits

— These investments are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Commercial paper

— These investments are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Corporate debt securities

— Valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.

Government securities

— Valued at the most recent closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or, absent an active market, utilizing observable inputs such as closing prices in less frequently traded markets.

Asset-backed securities

— Valued using a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of benchmark instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

8. Investments (Continued)

Equity securities

— Valued using the most recent closing price of PTC common stock quoted on Nasdaq, less a temporary discount for lack of marketability. The discount for lack of marketability, which will reverse upon registration of the PTC Shares, is calculated using a put-option model which includes observable and unobservable inputs and is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The primary inputs include historical and implied PTC common stock volatility and the transfer restriction term.

Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy. We did not have any transfers between levels of fair value measurements during the periods presented.

Fair values of our investments were (in millions):

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of our Level 3 investments (in millions):

Upon purchase of the PTC Shares, we recorded our investment of

$954.9 million

.  The investment consisted of the purchase price of approximately

$1.0 billion

less a loss of

$45.1 million

, which includes a

$71.9 million

valuation adjustment pending registration of the PTC Shares, partially offset by a gain of

$26.8 million

, resulting from the difference between the purchase price of

$94.50

per share and the most recent closing price of PTC common stock quoted on Nasdaq on the Purchase date. The unrealized gain of

$135.1 million

includes a gain of

$96.9 million

, resulting from appreciation of the PTC Shares between the Purchase date and the end of the fiscal year, and a

$38.2 million

decrease in the valuation adjustment associated with a reduction in the expected term of the transfer restriction.

The investment of

$1,090.0 million

at

September 30, 2018

includes a gain of

$123.7 million

on investment and a

$33.7 million

valuation adjustment.

9. Derivative Instruments

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt obligations to manage certain foreign currency risks.  We also use interest rate swap contracts to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  The following information explains how we use and value these types of derivative instruments and how they impact our consolidated financial statements.

Additional information related to the impacts of cash flow hedges on other comprehensive income (loss) is included in Note 10.

Types of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Cash Flow Hedges

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next

two years

(cash flow hedges). We report in other comprehensive income (loss) the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that we designate and that qualify as cash flow hedges. We reclassify these gains or losses into earnings in the same periods when the hedged transactions affect earnings.  To the extent forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are ineffective, changes in value are recorded in earnings through the maturity date.  There was

no impact

on earnings due to ineffective cash flow hedges. At

September 30, 2018

, we had a U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of

$754.7 million

of foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

The pre-tax amount of gains (losses) recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges that would have been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations had they not been so designated was (in millions):

The pre-tax amount of gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to derivative forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, which offset the related gains and losses on the hedged items during the periods presented, was (in millions):

Approximately

$5.7 million

of pre-tax net unrealized

gains

on cash flow hedges as of

September 30, 2018

will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. We expect that these net unrealized

gains

will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings.

Net Investment Hedges

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt obligations to hedge portions of our net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries (net investment hedges) against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. For all instruments that are designated as net investment hedges and meet effectiveness requirements, the net changes in value of the designated hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareowners’ equity where they offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally. To the extent forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges are ineffective, changes in value are recorded in earnings through the maturity date. There was

no impact

on earnings due to ineffective net investment hedges. At

September 30, 2018

, we had a gross notional amount of

$81.0 million

of foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.

9. Derivative Instruments (Continued)

Fair Value Hedges

We use interest rate swap contracts to manage the borrowing costs of certain long-term debt. In February 2015, we issued

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount of fixed rate notes. Upon issuance of these notes, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert these notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. We designate these contracts as fair value hedges because they hedge the changes in fair value of the fixed rate notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The changes in value of these fair value hedges are recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and are offset by the losses or gains on the underlying debt instruments, which are also recorded in interest expense. There was

no impact

on earnings due to ineffective fair value hedges. At

September 30, 2018

, the aggregate notional value of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was

$600.0 million

The pre-tax amount of net

(losses) gains

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which we do not elect hedge accounting are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in each period, based on the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments. At

September 30, 2018

, we had a U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of

$194.7 million

of foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments.

The pre-tax amount of gains (losses) from forward exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations was (in millions):

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We value our forward exchange contracts using a market approach. We use a valuation model based on inputs including forward and spot prices for currency and interest rate curves. We did not change our valuation techniques during fiscal


,


or


.  It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of our forward exchange contracts totaled

$1,030.4 million

at

September 30, 2018

. Currency pairs (buy/sell) comprising the most significant contract notional values were United States dollar (USD)/Euro, USD/Canadian dollar, USD/Singapore dollar, USD/Swiss franc, Euro/British pound and USD/Mexican peso. Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy.

shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, upon grant, or in payment of restricted stock units. Shares relating to awards under our 2012 Plan, or 2008 Long-Term Incentives Plan, as amended, that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance or delivery of shares will be available for further awards under the 2012 Plan. Approximately

Stock Options

We have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under various incentive plans at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates. The exercise price for stock options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, already-owned shares of common stock or a combination of cash and such shares. Stock options expire

The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using daily historical volatility of our stock price over the most recent period corresponding to the expected term as of the grant date. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options.

12. Retirement Benefits

We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension plans

provide for monthly pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Effective July 1, 2010, we closed participation in our U.S. and Canada pension plans to employees hired after June 30, 2010. Employees hired after June 30, 2010 are instead eligible to participate in defined contribution plans. Effective October 1, 2010, we also closed participation in our U.K. pension plan to employees hired after September 30, 2010 and these employees are now eligible for a defined contribution plan. Benefits to be provided to plan participants hired before July 1, 2010 or October 1, 2010, respectively, are not affected by these changes. Our policy with respect to funding our pension obligations is to fund at a minimum the amount required by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans in

Plan Assets

In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we consider actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets. We also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. This resulted in the selection of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global weighted-average targeted and actual asset allocations at September 30, by asset category, are:

The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the plan’s benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager.

As of

September 30, 2018

and


, our pension plans do not directly own our common stock.

In certain countries where we operate, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a separate pension fund.

The valuation methodologies used for our pension plans’ investments measured at fair value are described as follows. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at

September 30, 2018

and


.

Common stock

— Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

Mutual funds

— Valued at the net asset value (NAV) reported by the fund.

Corporate debt

— Valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.

Government securities

— Valued at the most recent closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or, absent an active market, utilizing observable inputs such as closing prices in less frequently traded markets.

Common collective trusts

— Valued at the NAV as determined by the custodian of the fund. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding.

Private equity and alternative equity

— Valued at the estimated fair value, as determined by the respective fund manager, based on the NAV of the investment units held at year end, which is subject to judgment.

Real estate funds

— Consists of the real estate funds, which provide an indirect investment into a diversified and multi-sector portfolio of property assets.  Publicly-traded real estate funds are valued at the most recent closing price reported on the SIX Swiss Exchange.  The remainder is valued at the estimated fair value, as determined by the respective fund manager, based on the NAV of the investment units held at year end, which is subject to judgment.

Insurance contracts

— Valued at the aggregate amount of accumulated contribution and investment income less amounts used to make benefit payments and administrative expenses which approximates fair value.

Other

— Consists of other fixed income investments and common collective trusts with a mix of equity and fixed income underlying assets. Other fixed income investments are valued at the most recent closing price reported in the markets in which the individual securities are traded, which may be infrequently.

14. Income Taxes

Selected income tax data (in millions):

Provisional Amounts

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from U.S. tax ("transition tax"). As a fiscal year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Act impact us in fiscal year 2018, including the change in the federal statutory rate and the one-time transition tax, while other provisions will be effective in fiscal year 2019, including the tax on global intangible low-tax income ("GILTI") of foreign subsidiaries, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income ("FDII"), and the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction.

Our base rate reflects a change in the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. The rate change was effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year, using a blended rate for the annual period. As a result, the blended statutory rate for our fiscal year 2018 is

24.53

percent.

In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on how a company may recognize provisional estimates related to the effects of the Tax Act. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from provisional estimates as a result of additional analysis of provisions of the Tax Act, and interpretation of any additional guidance issued by standard-setting and regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Treasury Department and FASB. The Company will complete its accounting related to the Tax Act within the one-year measurement period allowed under SAB 118.

As a result of the Tax Act, we revalued our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rate at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is either

24.53

percent for reversals in 2018 or


percent for reversals in 2019 and subsequent years. We have recorded a provisional amount of

$104.4 million

in the year ended September 30, 2018.

The Tax Act requires the transition tax to be computed based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”) at December 31, 2017, that were previously deferred from U.S. income tax. As a result, we are required to make reasonable estimates given our September 30 fiscal year. We have recorded a provisional expense of

$395.8 million

for the transition tax liability for all of our foreign subsidiaries in 2018. The transition tax is applied to the balance of post-1986 E&P at rates of 15.5 percent of cash assets (as defined in the Tax Act) and 8 percent for non-cash assets measured at the higher of the balance at September 30, 2018, or the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Income Taxes (Continued)

average of the ending balances at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017. Our estimates will change as a result of adjustments impacting E&P, and distributions and other transactions impacting cash. Under the Tax Act, the Company will elect to pay the transition tax interest-free over eight years, with

8%

due in each of the first five years,

15%

in year six,

20%

in year seven, and

25%

in year eight. We have recorded income taxes payable of

$389.4 million

in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which

$31.1 million

is recorded within other current liabilities and

$358.3 million

is recorded within other liabilities because that portion is payable greater than twelve months after September 30, 2018.

The Tax Act includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The FASB allows companies to adopt an accounting policy to either recognize deferred taxes for GILTI or treat it as a tax cost in the year incurred. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act and the application of U.S. GAAP. The GILTI provisions will be effective for us beginning October 1, 2018.

The Company has historically accounted for the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as being indefinitely reinvested under ASC 740-30. As a result of the broad changes to the U.S. international tax system under the Tax Act, the Company will begin to account for substantially all of its non-U.S. subsidiaries as being immediately subject to tax, while still concluding that earnings are indefinitely reinvested for a limited number of subsidiaries. For non-U.S. subsidiaries that are accounted for as being immediately subject to tax, we have recorded deferred tax liabilities of

$34.8 million

related to foreign withholding taxes on future distributions of historic earnings and deferred tax assets of

$9.9 million

related to U.S. foreign tax credits attributable to the foreign withholding taxes. The company continues to treat as permanently invested the earnings of a limited number of its subsidiaries due mainly to local country repatriation restrictions. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as they are not material.

Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation

The reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate was:

We operate in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions under government-sponsored tax incentive programs, which may be extended if certain additional requirements are met. The program which generates the primary benefit will expire in

We believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to

$6.0 million

in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations.  If all of the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, the net reduction to our income tax provision, including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets, could be up to

$5.5 million

Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by third parties.

Environmental remediation cost liabilities and related expected recoveries are as follows (in millions):

Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise.

Conditional asset retirement obligations and related expected recoveries are as follows (in millions):

There have been no significant changes in liabilities incurred, liabilities settled, accretion expense or revisions in estimated cash flows for the periods ended

September 30, 2018

and


, respectively.

Other Matters

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (Continued)

We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. Currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. In some cases, the claims involve products from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our former Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us, which occurred on January 31, 2007. We are also responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against our former Rockwell International Corporation's divested measurement and flow control business. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising from our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. Following litigation against Nationwide Indemnity Company (Nationwide) and Kemper Insurance (Kemper), the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to Allen-Bradley, we entered into separate agreements on April 1, 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. In exchange for a lump sum payment, Kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to Allen-Bradley. Nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. We believe that this arrangement with Nationwide will continue to provide coverage for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability.

We also have rights to historic insurance policies that provide indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising out of certain asbestos liabilities relating to the divested measurement and flow control business. Following litigation against several insurers to pursue coverage for these claims, we entered into separate agreements with the insurers that resulted in both lump sum payments and coverage-in-place agreements. We believe these arrangements will provide substantial coverage for future defense and indemnity costs for these asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of asbestos liability.

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.

In connection with the spin-offs of our former automotive business, semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the respective businesses, including environmental and intellectual property matters.

In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor Electric Company for costs and damages related to certain legal, legacy environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January 31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale.

15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (Continued)

Indemnification liabilities and related expected recoveries are as follows (in millions):

Included in the above are certain environmental indemnification liabilities that are substantially indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation for which we have recorded a liability of

and

$6.6 million

, and a related receivable of

$4.5 million

$6.2 million

, as of

September 30, 2018

, respectively.

In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale.  We also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in other contracts with third parties, such as contracts concerning the development and manufacture of our hardware and software products. As of

September 30, 2018

, we were not aware of any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible of an unfavorable outcome.  Historically, claims that have been made under the indemnification agreements have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a particular period.

16. Business Segment Information (Continued)

The following tables reflect the sales and operating results of our reportable segments (in millions):

Among other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based upon segment operating earnings before income taxes, costs related to the unsolicited Emerson proposals  in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices, non-operating pension costs, certain corporate initiatives, gains and losses on investments, valuation adjustment pending registration of PTC Shares, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization. Depending on the product, intersegment sales within a single legal entity are either at cost or cost plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market price. Sales between legal entities are at an appropriate transfer price. We allocate costs related to shared segment operating activities to the segments using a methodology consistent with the expected benefit.

The following tables summarize the identifiable assets at

18. Rocky Flats Settlement

From 1975 to 1989, Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) operated the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado for the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE). In 1990, a class of landowners near Rocky Flats sued RIC and Dow Chemical, another former operator of the facility. In May 2016, the parties agreed to settle this case and the DoE authorized the settlement. Under the court approved settlement agreement, we and Dow Chemical agreed to pay

$375.0 million

in the aggregate to resolve the claims. Under RIC’s contract with the DoE and federal law, RIC was entitled to indemnification by the DoE for its portion of the settlement amount, which was

$243.75 million

. When RIC was acquired by Boeing in 1996, we agreed to indemnify Boeing for RIC’s liabilities related to Rocky Flats and received the benefits of RIC’s corresponding indemnity rights against the DoE. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, in fiscal 2016, RIC paid an initial amount of

$1.25 million

to the plaintiff class escrow fund. In January 2017, the DoE fulfilled its indemnification obligation by paying

$243.75 million

, and the full amount of RIC's obligation under the settlement agreement has now been transferred to the plaintiff class escrow fund.  As a result, we were not required to make any payment under the settlement agreement.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

September 30, 2018

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareowners’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended

September 30, 2018

, and the related notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

September 30, 2018

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

September 30, 2018

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion,  the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial  reporting as of

September 30, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO

.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness, as of

September 30, 2018

, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

September 30, 2018

.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

September 30, 2018

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of

September 30, 2018

, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) under the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard on October 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance required additional functionality within our enterprise-wide information technology system in addition to new accounting processes, policies and procedures. The Company also implemented new internal controls for revenue recognition, including the adjustments to retained earnings required under the modified retrospective method of adoption and the related disclosures required under the new guidance.
