Item 1.

Business

General

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (“Rockwell Automation” or the “Company”),

a leader in industrial automation and information, makes its customers more productive and the world more sustainable

. Our products, solutions and services are designed to meet our customers’ needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce enterprise business risk.

The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC.



As used herein, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, “Rockwell Automation” or the “Company” include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.

Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on

February 6, 2018

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. These risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy. Our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on the Company only to a limited extent.

A team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and reviews significant identified risks. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. Our other Board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.

Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. However, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.

Adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability.

We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays or defaults, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.

Demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve. As economic activity slows, credit markets tighten, or sovereign debt concerns arise, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, which could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions. If our access to credit, including the commercial paper market, is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise, our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced.

We sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries.

We do business in more than


countries around the world. Approximately

45 percent

of our sales in


were to customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world. The future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in non-U.S. markets. Our global operations are subject to numerous financial, legal and operating risks, such as political and economic instability; prevalence of corruption in certain countries; enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights; and compliance with existing and future laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, investments, taxation, trade controls, product content and performance, employment and repatriation of earnings. In addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates.

An inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new products requires high levels of innovation, and the development process is often lengthy and costly. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences, demand for our products could decline.



Failures or security breaches of our products, manufacturing environment, or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business.

We rely heavily on information technology (IT) in our products, solutions and services for customers, manufacturing environment, and in our enterprise IT infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. Despite the implementation of security measures, IT systems, including our corporate enterprise systems, manufacturing systems, and industrial control systems such as those we sell and service, are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states, hackers, cyber-criminals, malicious insiders and other actors who may engage in fraud, theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage. These systems are also vulnerable to malware (including ransomware), cyber attack, and other events, ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats.  Recent global cyber attacks have been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widely-used software products, increasing the risk of this potential threat.  In some cases, these malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain, moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections.

Our products, solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft, tampering or sabotage.  Among other industries, our products, solutions and services are often employed in the control of critical infrastructure.  Careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property. While we continue to improve the security attributes of our products, solutions and services, we can reduce risk, not eliminate it. To a significant extent, the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed, installed, protected, configured, updated and monitored, much of which are typically outside our control.

Our business uses IT resources on a dispersed, global basis for a wide variety of functions including development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, accounting, and human resources. Our vendors, partners, employees and customers have access to, and share, information across multiple locations via various digital technologies.  In addition, we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities. Secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations. Also, our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers, employees and others.

Our information security efforts, under the leadership of our Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Product Security Officer, with the support of the entire management team, include major programs designed to address security governance, product security, identification and protection of critical assets, insider risk, third-party risk, and cyber defense operations. We believe these measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of an information security incident.

Any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns.

There are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses.

Risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification, including defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing projects, and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers. If we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, we could incur cost overruns, liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect

our results of operations.

New legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business.

Legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business.  For example, we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material, product, certification and labeling laws and regulations. Our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements. These requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements could impact demand for our products, solutions and services.



Our industry is highly competitive.

We face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects. We compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings, technology differentiation, the domain expertise of our employees and partners, product performance, quality of our products, solutions and services, knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges, pricing, delivery and customer service. The relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments. We seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems. In addition, we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure. If we fail to achieve our objectives, to keep pace with technological changes, or to provide high quality products, solutions and services, we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins. We expect the level of competition to remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.

We face the potential harms of natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.

Our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world.  Natural disasters, pandemics, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create economic instability. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products.

Intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.

Others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. We frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. Indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly.

In addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business. The inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant.

Claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial position.

We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. We must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.

Our business success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified personnel.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. Difficulty attracting, developing, and retaining members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.

One important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits. The expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit pension plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates, the value of plan assets, mortality assumptions and health care trend rates.  Significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses.  Expenses related to employer-funded health care benefits depend on laws and regulations, which could change, as well as health care cost inflation.  An inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.



We rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales.

In the United States and Canada, a large percentage of our sales are through distributors. In certain other countries, the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors. We depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our products and services and deliver value to our customers. Disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our products and services could adversely affect our sales. A disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of a distributor or other events.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims and environmental remediation) could reduce our profitability.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products, solutions and services we sell, employment, contract matters, and environmental remediation.

We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago. Our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities, which could result in product liability claims. The uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution.

Our operations are subject to various environmental regulations that are concerned with human health, the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground, and water, the quality of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances. Our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals, as well as properties that we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. We have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.

Failure to identify, manage, complete, and integrate acquisitions and technology investments may adversely affect our business.

As part of our strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of or investment opportunities in businesses as well as the purchase of technology from third parties. In order to be successful with these transactions, we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, successfully complete the transaction, and manage post-closing matters, such as integration of the acquired business or technology. We may not be able to identify or complete beneficial acquisition or transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them. Even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions, we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions, including:

•

difficulties in integrating the purchased operations, technologies, products or services, retaining the acquired business’ customers and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as sales increases, access to technologies, cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired time frames;

•

loss of key employees of the acquired business;

•

legal and compliance issues;

•

difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and

•

diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.

Future acquisitions and technology investments could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.



We rely on suppliers to provide equipment, components and services.

Our business requires that we buy equipment, components and services including finished products, electronic components and commodities such as copper, aluminum and steel. Our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks, including:

•

poor quality or an insecure supply chain, which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our products;

•

changes in the cost of these purchases due to inflation, exchange rates, commodity market volatility or other factors;

•

intellectual property risks such as ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliers;

•

information security risks associated with providing confidential information to suppliers; and

•

shortages of components, commodities or other materials, which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery.

Any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete. We also maintain several single-source supplier relationships, because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products. Even where substitute sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of sales.

Overview

Rockwell Automation, Inc.,

a leader in industrial automation and information, makes its customers more productive and the world more sustainable

. Overall demand for our products, solutions and services is driven by:

•

investments in manufacturing, including upgrades, modifications and expansions of existing facilities or production lines and new facilities or production lines;

•

investments in basic materials production capacity, which may be related to commodity pricing levels;

•

our customers’ needs for faster time to market, lower total cost of ownership, improved asset utilization and optimization, and enterprise risk management;

•

our customers’ needs to continuously improve quality, safety and sustainability;

•

industry factors that include our customers’ new product introductions, demand for our customers’ products or services and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate;

•

levels of global industrial production and capacity utilization;

•

regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic circumstances; and

•

the spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedules.

Long-term Strategy

Our strategy is to bring The Connected Enterprise to life. We integrate control and information across the enterprise to help industrial companies and their people be more productive. Our vision of being the most valued global provider of innovative industrial automation and information products, solutions and services is supported by our growth and performance strategy, which seeks to:

•

achieve organic sales growth in excess of the automation market by expanding our served market and strengthening our competitive differentiation;

•

diversify our sales streams by broadening our portfolio of products, solutions and services, expanding our global presence and serving a wider range of industries and applications;

•

grow market share by gaining new customers and by capturing a larger share of existing customers’ spending;

•

enhance our market access by building our channel capability and partner network;

•

acquire companies that serve as catalysts to organic growth by adding complementary technology, expanding our served market, or enhancing our domain expertise or market access;

•

deploy human and financial resources to strengthen our technology leadership and our intellectual capital business model;

•

continuously improve quality and customer experience; and

•

drive annual cost productivity.

By implementing the above strategy, we seek to achieve our long-term financial goals, including above-market organic sales growth, EPS growth above sales growth, return on invested capital in excess of 20 percent and free cash flow equal to about 100 percent of Adjusted Income. We expect acquisitions to add a percentage point or more per year to long-term sales growth.



Our customers face the challenge of remaining globally cost competitive and automation can help them achieve their productivity and sustainability objectives. Our value proposition is to help our customers reduce time to market, lower total cost of ownership, improve asset utilization and manage enterprise risks.

Differentiation through Technology Innovation and Domain Expertise

We seek a technology leadership position in industrial automation. We believe that our three platforms - integrated architecture, intelligent motor control and solutions and services - provide the foundation for a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.

Our integrated control and information architecture, with Logix at its core, is an important differentiator. We are the only automation provider that can support discrete, process, batch, safety, motion and power control on the same hardware platform with the same software programming environment.  Our integrated architecture is scalable with standard open communications protocols making it easier for customers to implement it more cost effectively.

Intelligent motor control is one of our core competencies and an important aspect of an automation system. These products and solutions enhance the availability, efficiency and safe operation of our customers' critical and most energy-intensive plant assets.  Our intelligent motor control offering can be integrated seamlessly with the Logix architecture.

Domain expertise refers to the industry and application knowledge required to deliver solutions and services that support customers through the entire life cycle of their automation investment.  The combination of industry-specific domain expertise of our people with our innovative technologies enables us to help our customers solve their manufacturing and business challenges.

Global Expansion

As the manufacturing world continues to expand, we must be able to meet our customers’ needs around the world. Approximately

60 percent

of our employees and

45 percent

of our sales are outside the U.S. We continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets.

As we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products, solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions. We have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing, product development and customer-facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world. The emerging markets of Asia Pacific, including China and India, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa are projected to be the fastest growing over the long term, due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middle-class population. We believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.

Enhanced Market Access

Over the past decade, our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to over $90 billion. Our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity. Logix is the technology foundation that enabled us to become an industry leader for process applications. We complement that with a growing global network of engineers and partners to provide solutions to process customers.

OEMs represent another area of addressed market expansion and an important growth opportunity. To remain competitive, OEMs need to find the optimal balance of machine cost and performance while reducing their time to market. Our scalable integrated architecture and intelligent motor control offerings, along with design productivity tools and our motion and safety products, can assist OEMs in addressing these business needs.

We have developed a powerful network of channel partners, technology partners and commercial partners that act as amplifiers to our internal capabilities and enable us to serve our customers’ needs around the world.

Broad Range of Industries Served

We apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges. We serve customers in a wide range of industries, including consumer products, heavy industries and transportation.

Our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences industries. These customers’ needs include new capacity, incremental capacity from existing facilities, flexible manufacturing and regulatory compliance. These customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors.



We serve customers in heavy industries, including oil and gas, mining, aggregates, cement, metals, energy, semiconductor, pulp and paper and water/wastewater. Companies in resource-based industries typically invest in capacity expansion when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is increasing. In addition, there is ongoing investment in upgrades of aging automation systems and productivity.

In the transportation industry, factors such as geographic expansion, investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers’ automation investment decisions. Our sales in transportation are primarily to automotive and tire manufacturers.

All of these industries also generate maintenance repair order (MRO) and ongoing services revenue related to the installed base.

Outsourcing and Sustainability Trends

Demand for our products, solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers. Customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base. Our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally.

We help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency, environmental and safety goals. Customers across all industries are investing in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor control and energy efficient solutions and services. In addition, environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices.

Acquisitions

Our acquisition strategy focuses on products, solutions and services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings.

In September 2016, we acquired Maverick Technologies, a leading systems integrator. This acquisition significantly enhances our expertise in key process and batch applications that help our customers realize greater productivity and improved global competitiveness through process control and information management solutions.

In September 2016, we acquired Automation Control Products, a premier provider in centralized thin client, remote desktop and server management software. This acquisition strengthens our ability to provide our customers with visual display and software solutions to manage information and streamline workflows for a more connected manufacturing environment.

In March 2016, we acquired MagneMotion Inc., a leading manufacturer of intelligent conveying systems. This acquisition continues our strategy to build a portfolio of smart manufacturing technologies by expanding our existing capabilities in independent cart technology.

In October 2014, we acquired the assets of ESC Services, Inc., a global provider of lockout-tagout services and solutions. This acquisition enables our customers to increase their asset utilization and strengthen their enterprise risk management.

We believe these acquisitions will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers.

Continuous Improvement

Productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture. We have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement, functional streamlining, material cost savings and manufacturing productivity. Our implementation of common global processes and an enterprise-wide business system is nearly complete. These are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation. Our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization. Charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs.



U. S. Industrial Economic Trends

In


, sales in the U.S. accounted for

55 percent

of our total sales. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served U.S. markets include:

•

The Industrial Production (IP) Index, published by the Federal Reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The IP Index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2012. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the IP Index and the level of automation investment made by our U.S. customers in their manufacturing base.

•

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which indicates the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.

•

Industrial Equipment Spending, compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy. This measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a reasonable correlation with our domestic growth.

•

Capacity Utilization (Total Industry), published by the Federal Reserve, which measures plant operating activity. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between Capacity Utilization and levels of U.S. IP.

The table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal


to


. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, all four indicators improved compared to the same quarter in the prior year, with PMI and Industrial Equipment Spending also improving sequentially.

Note: Economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations.



Non-U.S. Economic Trends

In


, sales outside the U.S. accounted for

45 percent

of our total sales. These customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence. In addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “Overview” section, international demand, particularly in emerging markets, has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region, investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets. We use changes in the respective countries' gross domestic product and IP as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business.

Having seen a return to industrial production growth in all regions in fiscal year 2017, further growth is forecast for fiscal year 2018. In Europe, business sentiment remains at high levels, while in Asia the macroeconomic environment is stable. In Latin America, business confidence and investment levels in Brazil are improving, although growth is expected to slow in Mexico. Industrial production and GDP growth in Canada is expected to continue in fiscal year 2018.

,


and


(in millions, except per share amounts):

(1)

See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for the definition of segment operating earnings.

(2)

Total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, general corporate – net, non-operating pension costs, interest expense and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. We believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.

(3)

Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP earnings measure that excludes the non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. See

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation

for more information on this non-GAAP measure.

(4)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold a product distribution business within our Control Products & Solutions segment. This business held no intellectual property and included products sold outside of our core channel and under different brands. We sold this business for approximately $94 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of

$60.8 million

, which is included within Other Income (Expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.



Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and non-operating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment's operating performance for internal purposes. If we were to allocate these costs, we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows (in millions):

The increases in non-operating pension costs in both segments in fiscal


were primarily due to the decrease in our U.S. discount rate from 4.55 percent for fiscal 2016 to 3.75 percent for fiscal


.

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. Non-operating pension costs include defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements.  These components of net periodic pension cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business. We believe that Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Adjusted EPS is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measures of Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations, diluted EPS and effective tax rate.

Financial Condition

The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions):

The following table summarizes free cash flow (in millions), which is a non-GAAP financial measure:

Our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses' operations and execute our strategy. Cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations, if any. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations, if any, are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted a new share-based compensation accounting standard that requires the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation to be classified as an operating, rather than as a financing, cash flow. In previous periods, we added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, no adjustment is necessary as this benefit is already included in operating cash flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.

Cash provided by operating activities was

$1,034.0 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2017

compared to

$947.3 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2016

. Free cash flow was

$892.3 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2017

compared to

$833.7 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2016

. The year-over-year increases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to lower incentive compensation and income tax payments, partially offset by a voluntary contribution of $200.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan in


.

We repurchased approximately

2.3 million

shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in


at a total cost of

$336.6 million

. In


, we repurchased approximately

4.6 million

shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of

$500.2 million

. At

September 30, 2017

there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable.  At

September 30, 2016

, there were

$5.3 million

of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until


. Our decision to repurchase shares in


will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price. On April 6, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized us to expend an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock.  At

September 30, 2017

we had approximately

$608.4 million

remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorization. See Part II, Item 5.

Market for the Company’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

, for additional information regarding share repurchases.



We expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our retirement plans, acquisitions of businesses, dividends to shareowners, repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt, including the current portion of long-term debt. We expect capital expenditures in


to be about

$160 million

. We expect to fund the

$250.0 million

current portion of long term debt due December 2017 with the issuance of commercial paper. We expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term investments, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities.

Given our extensive international operations, significant amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (funds) are held by non-U.S. subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested.  Generally, these funds would be subject to U.S. tax if repatriated.  As of

September 30, 2017

, substantially all of our funds were held by these non-U.S. subsidiaries. The percentage of these funds held by non-U.S. subsidiaries can vary from quarter to quarter although substantially all of our funds were held by these non-U.S. subsidiaries on average over the past eight quarters. We have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations.

In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our short-term debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

, our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in March 2020 was

$1.0 billion

. We can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to

$350.0 million

, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility. We have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended

September 30, 2017

or


. In December 2016, we amended the financial covenant under this credit facility. The previous financial covenant, which limited our debt-to-total-capital ratio to 60 percent, was replaced with a minimum EBITDA-to-interest ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. The EBITDA-to-interest ratio is defined in the amendment as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the amendment) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period. We believe the new covenant provides us greater financial flexibility. Separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately

$128.4 million

at

September 30, 2017

were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Borrowings under our non-U.S. credit facilities at

September 30, 2017

and

September 30, 2016

were not significant. We were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at

September 30, 2017

and

September 30, 2016

. Additional information related to our credit facilities is included in Note 5 in the Financial Statements.

Among other uses, we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the short-term credit ratings set forth in the table below. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.

The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of

September 30, 2017

:

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions. We have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.

We regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.



We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. We also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. In addition, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities' functional currencies. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.

A summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at

September 30, 2017

is as follows (in millions):

(a)

The amounts for long-term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. The amounts include interest but exclude the amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap contracts, including the

$4.6 million

fair value adjustment recorded for the interest rate swap contracts at

September 30, 2017

and the unamortized discount of

$44.8 million

at

September 30, 2017

. The 2018 amount includes the

$250.0 million

5.65% notes due in December 2017. See Note 5 in the Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt.

(b)

Our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and are subject to change. Amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.

(c)

Amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates of known commitments. Contributions to our pension plans beyond


will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time. Amounts subsequent to


are excluded from the summary above, as these amounts cannot be estimated with certainty. The minimum contribution for our U.S. pension plan as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is currently zero. We may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management.

(d)

This item includes contractual commitments for capital expenditures, certain materials purchases and long-term obligations under agreements with various service providers.

(e)

Other long-term liabilities include environmental remediation costs, conditional asset retirement obligations and indemnification liabilities, net of related receivables. Amounts subsequent to


are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities will be paid.

(f)

Amount for unrecognized tax benefits includes accrued interest and penalties. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or paid.



Supplemental Sales Information

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales (in millions):

Critical Accounting Estimates

We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. These estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions, but actual results could differ from those estimates. Refer to Note 1 in the Financial Statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies.

Retirement Benefits — Pension

Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods.

Our global pension expense in


was

$175.9 million

compared to

$161.3 million

in


. Approximately 77 percent of our


global pension expense relates to our U.S. pension plan. The actuarial assumptions used to determine our


U.S. pension expense included the following: discount rate of

3.75 percent

(compared to

4.55 percent

for


) and expected rate of return on plan assets of

7.50 percent

(compared to

7.50 percent

for


).

For


our U.S. discount rate will increase to

3.90 percent

from

3.75 percent

in


. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans.

For


our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets will remain

7.50 percent

. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets. We also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. The financial markets produced positive returns in


. The plan’s debt securities return was positive. The plan’s equity securities return was above the expected return range in


, as U.S. and international equity returns were positive for the year. The actual return for our portfolio of U.S. plan assets was approximately

8.95 percent

annualized for the 15 years ended

September 30, 2017

, and was approximately

7.45 percent

annualized for the 20 years ended

September 30, 2017

.

The target allocations and ranges of long-term expected return for our major categories of U.S. plan assets are as follows:

The changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost. The change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation.

The following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):

(1)  Change includes both operating and non-operating pension costs.

More information regarding pension benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements.



Revenue Recognition

—

Customer Incentives

We offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria.  Customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Customer incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products, solutions and services to be provided. We record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within Customer returns, rebates and incentives in our Consolidated Balance Sheet or, where a right of setoff exists, as a reduction of Receivables.

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. Our estimate is based primarily on historical experience. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately

$9.7 million

.

More information regarding our revenue recognition and returns, rebates and incentives policies are contained in Note 1 in the Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

—

Undistributed Earnings

Our annual tax rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes for

$3,526.0 million

of undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, since these earnings have been determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and thus are not subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that may be payable upon distribution of these earnings.

More information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 14 in the Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 in the Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of

$13.5 million

and a liability of

$36.4 million

at

September 30, 2017

. We enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In


and


, the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations. While future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to


levels.

Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. For such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts, a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pre-tax income by approximately $21.4 million.

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. The use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately. There was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in


or


. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk

In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.

Our short-term debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

$350.0 million

at

September 30, 2017

, with a weighted average interest rate of

1.26 percent

and weighted average maturity period of

10 days

.  Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

$448.6 million

at

September 30, 2016

, with a weighted average interest rate of

0.57 percent

and weighted average maturity period of

35 days

. We have issued, and anticipate continuing to issue, additional short-term commercial paper obligations as needed. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our short-term debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition.

We had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with a carrying value of

$1,243.4 million

at

September 30, 2017

and

$1,516.3 million

at

September 30, 2016

. The fair value of this debt was

$1,452.6 million

at

September 30, 2017

and

$1,780.5 million

at

September 30, 2016

. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of our long-term debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity.

In February 2015, we entered into interest rate swap contracts, which we designated as fair value hedges.  These interest rate swaps effectively converted the

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount of our

2.050 percent

notes payable in March 2020 (2020 Notes) and

2.875 percent

notes payable in March 2025 (2025 Notes) to floating rate debt, each at a rate based on three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The effective floating interest rates were

1.755 percent

for the 2020 Notes and

2.165 percent

for the 2025 Notes at

September 30, 2017

.  The fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at

September 30, 2017

was a net unrealized

loss

of

$4.6 million

.  A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our interest rate swaps would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (“Rockwell Automation” or “the Company”),

a leader in industrial automation and information, makes its customers more productive and the world more sustainable

.

Basis of Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have control but exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the aggregate to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete inventory; share-based compensation; acquisitions; product warranty obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters, conditional asset retirement obligations and contractual indemnifications; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions prospectively when warranted by factually-based experience.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Product and solution sales consist of industrial automation and information solutions; hardware and software products; and custom-engineered systems. Service sales include multi-vendor customer technical support and repair, asset management and optimization consulting and training. All service sales recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations are associated with our Control Products & Solutions segment.

For approximately

85 percent

of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and products have been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.  Within this category, we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products and/or the performance of services, such as installation and commissioning.  The timing of delivery, though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component, is generally short-term in nature.  For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that element's relative selling price, provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control.  Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on our separate selling price for that or a similar item, or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.  If such evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of accounting.  We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others.  Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion.  Under the percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified.  We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (Continued)

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of a sales agreement. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products, solutions and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of setoff exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable.

Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions

Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales, value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenue).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and other fixed income securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments include time deposits, certificates of deposit and other fixed income securities with original maturities longer than three months at the time of purchase and less than one year from period end. All investments meeting the definition of a security are accounted for as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. All other investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Receivables

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of

$24.9 million

at

September 30, 2017

and

$24.5 million

at

September 30, 2016

. In addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain customer returns, rebates and incentives of

$11.9 million

at

September 30, 2017

and

$7.9 million

at

September 30, 2016

.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.

Property

Property, including internal-use software, is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line method over


to

40 years

for buildings and improvements,


to

20 years

for machinery and equipment and


to

8 years

for computer hardware and internal-use software. We capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off replaced units. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts. Property acquired during the year that is accrued within accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end is considered to be a non-cash investing activity and is excluded from cash used for capital expenditures in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Capital expenditures of

$29.6 million

,

$29.9 million

and

$27.3 million

were accrued within accounts payable and other current liabilities at

September 30, 2017

,


and


, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (Continued)

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as goodwill.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may be present. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We perform our annual impairment test during the second quarter of our fiscal year.

We amortize certain customer relationships on an accelerated basis over the period of which we expect the intangible asset to generate future cash flows. We amortize all other intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives assigned range from


to

15 years

for trademarks,


to

20 years

for customer relationships,


to

17 years

for technology and


to

30 years

for other intangible assets.

Intangible assets also include costs of software developed or purchased by our software business to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. Amortization of these computer software products is calculated on a product-by-product basis as the greater of (a) the unamortized cost at the beginning of the year times the ratio of the current year gross revenue for a product to the total of the current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or (b) the straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. We also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts to manage our borrowing costs of certain long-term debt. We designate and account for these derivative financial instruments as hedges under U.S. GAAP.

Furthermore, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities' functional currencies. It is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Currency transaction gains and losses are included in results of operations in the period incurred.

Research and Development Expenses

We expense research and development (R&D) costs as incurred; these costs were

$348.2 million

in


,

$319.3 million

in


and

$307.3 million

in


. We include R&D expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We account for uncertain tax positions by determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements based on our assertion of the most likely outcome resulting from an examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.

Earnings Per Share

We present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareowners, which is income excluding the allocation to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested restricted stock. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common-equivalent shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding share-based compensation awards, which requires us to compute total employee proceeds as the sum of the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award and the amount of unearned share-based compensation costs attributed to future services. Share-based compensation awards for which the total employee proceeds of the award exceed the average market price of the same award over the period have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation awards for the years ended

September 30, 2017

(

0.7 million

shares),


(

2.2 million

shares) and


(

1.4 million

shares) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation. U.S. GAAP requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, to be treated as participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Our participating securities are composed of unvested restricted stock and non-employee director restricted stock units.

The following table reconciles basic and diluted EPS amounts (in millions, except per share amounts):

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize share-based compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date.

Product and Workers’ Compensation Liabilities

We record accruals for product and workers’ compensation claims in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability and workers’ compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued.

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (Continued)

Environmental Matters

We record liabilities for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  We make changes to the liabilities in the periods in which the estimated costs of remediation change.  At third-party environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site, as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists, we record the liability net of the estimated recovery.  If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery.  At environmental sites where we are the sole responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation.  Ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period.  Our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing and/or amount of future cash payments.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We record liabilities for costs related to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible, long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset.  The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2017, the FASB issued a new standard regarding the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs. This standard requires the service cost component to be reported in the income statement in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the related employees during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component in either a separate line item or within another appropriate line item with disclosure of where those costs are recorded. This standard also requires that only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. This standard is effective for us for reporting periods starting October 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard on share-based compensation. This requirement is effective for us no later than October 1, 2017; however, we elected to adopt earlier as of October 1, 2016. This standard requires entities to record the excess income tax benefit or deficiency from share-based compensation within the income tax provision rather than within additional paid-in capital. This change reduced our income tax provision by

$29.0 million

in the year ended

September 30, 2017

. The standard also requires this benefit or deficiency to be classified as an operating cash flow rather than as a financing cash flow. The requirement to record the benefit or deficiency within the income tax provision is effective on a prospective basis. We have elected to adopt the cash flow presentation requirement on a prospective basis. Our adoption of all other requirements under the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard on accounting for leases that requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases, among other changes to existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about leasing activities. This standard is effective for us for reporting periods beginning October 1, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard on revenue recognition related to contracts with customers. This standard supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance and involves a five-step principles-based approach to recognizing revenue. The underlying principle is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The new standard will also require additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments made in applying the revenue guidance, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. We will adopt this new standard under the modified retrospective method in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized in retained earnings at the adoption date. We have established a project plan and a cross-functional implementation team to adopt the new standard. We are in the process of identifying and implementing necessary changes to accounting policies, processes, controls and systems to enable compliance with this new standard. We continue to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In February 2015, upon issuance of our notes payable in March 2020 (2020 Notes) and March 2025 (2025 Notes), we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts with multiple banks that effectively converted the

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount to floating rate debt, each at a rate based on three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread.  The effective floating interest rates were

1.755 percent

for the 2020 Notes and

2.165 percent

for the 2025 Notes at

September 30, 2017

The individual contracts are recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with corresponding adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt. Additional information related to our interest rate swap contracts is included in Note 9.

September 30, 2017

or


.  Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding.  In December 2016, we amended the financial covenant under this credit facility. The previous financial covenant, which limited our debt-to-total-capital ratio to

60 percent

, was replaced with a minimum EBITDA-to-interest ratio of

3.0

to 1.0. The EBITDA-to-interest ratio is defined in the amendment as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the amendment) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period. We believe the new covenant provides us greater financial flexibility. Separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately

$128.4 million

9. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurement (Continued)

Types of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Cash Flow Hedges

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next

two years

(cash flow hedges). We report in other comprehensive income (loss) the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that we designate and that qualify as cash flow hedges. We reclassify these gains or losses into earnings in the same periods when the hedged transactions affect earnings.  To the extent forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are ineffective, changes in value are recorded in earnings through the maturity date.  There was

no impact

on earnings due to ineffective cash flow hedges. At

September 30, 2017

, we had a U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of

$741.2 million

of foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

The pre-tax amount of (losses) gains recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges that would have been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations had they not been so designated was (in millions):

The pre-tax amount of gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to derivative forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, which offset the related gains and losses on the hedged items during the periods presented, was (in millions):

Approximately

$15.4 million

of pre-tax net unrealized

losses

on cash flow hedges as of

September 30, 2017

will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. We expect that these net unrealized

losses

will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings.

Net Investment Hedges

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt obligations to hedge portions of our net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries (net investment hedges) against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. For all instruments that are designated as net investment hedges and meet effectiveness requirements, the net changes in value of the designated hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareowners’ equity where they offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally. To the extent forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges are ineffective, changes in value are recorded in earnings through the maturity date. There was

no impact

on earnings due to ineffective net investment hedges. At

September 30, 2017

, we had a gross notional amount of

$677.3 million

of foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.

9. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurement (Continued)

Fair Value Hedges

We use interest rate swap contracts to manage the borrowing costs of certain long-term debt. In February 2015, we issued

$600.0 million

in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate notes. Upon issuance of these notes, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert these notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. We designate these contracts as fair value hedges because they hedge the changes in fair value of the fixed rate notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The changes in value of these fair value hedges are recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and are offset by the losses or gains on the underlying debt instruments, which are also recorded in interest expense. There was

no impact

on earnings due to ineffective fair value hedges. At

September 30, 2017

, the aggregate notional value of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was

$600.0 million

.

The pre-tax amount of net

(losses) gains

gains and losses

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which we do not elect hedge accounting are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in each period, based on the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments. At

September 30, 2017

, we had a U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of

$224.9 million

of foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments.

9. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurement (Continued)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. U.S. GAAP also classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:

Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Derivative Instruments

We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We value our forward exchange contracts using a market approach. We use a valuation model based on inputs including forward and spot prices for currency and interest rate curves. We did not change our valuation techniques during fiscal


,


or


.  It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of our forward exchange contracts totaled

$1,643.4 million

at

September 30, 2017

. Currency pairs (buy/sell) comprising the most significant contract notional values were United States dollar (USD)/euro, USD/Swiss franc, USD/Canadian dollar and Swiss franc/euro.

9. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurement (Continued)

Investments

We recognize all available-for-sale investments at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation methodologies used for our investments measured at fair value are described as follows.

Certificates of deposit and time deposits

— These investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Commercial paper

— These investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Corporate debt securities

— Valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.

Government securities

— Valued at the most recent closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or, absent an active market, utilizing observable inputs such as closing prices in less frequently traded markets.

Asset-backed securities

— Valued using a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of benchmark instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. We did not hold any Level 3 investments or have any transfers between levels of fair value measurements during the periods presented.

Other Financial Instruments

We also hold financial instruments consisting of cash, short-term debt and long-term debt. The fair values of our cash and short-term debt approximate their carrying amounts as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

We base the fair value of long-term debt upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.  The fair value of long-term debt below considers the terms of the debt excluding the impact of derivative and hedging activity.  The carrying amount of a portion of our long-term debt is impacted by fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts that are designated as fair value hedges.

The average risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using daily historical volatility of our stock price over the most recent period corresponding to the expected term as of the grant date. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options.

12. Retirement Benefits

We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Effective July 1, 2010 we closed participation in our U.S. and Canada pension plans to employees hired after June 30, 2010. Employees hired after June 30, 2010 are instead eligible to participate in employee savings plans. The Company contributions are based on age and years of service and range from

Effective October 1, 2010, we also closed participation in our U.K. pension plan to employees hired after September 30, 2010 and these employees are now eligible for a defined contribution plan. Benefits to be provided to plan participants hired before July 1, 2010 or October 1, 2010, respectively, are not affected by these changes. Our policy with respect to funding our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required by applicable laws and governmental regulations.  We were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans. However, we made a voluntary contribution of

Net Benefit Obligation Assumptions

Significant assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are (in weighted averages):

(1)

The health care cost trend rate reflects the estimated increase in gross medical claims costs. As a result of the plan amendment adopted effective October 1, 2002, our effective per person retiree medical cost increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for the majority of our postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we assume the gross health care cost trend rate will decrease to

for U.S. Plans and will not change in


for Non-U.S. Plans.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Retirement Benefits (Continued)

In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we consider actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets. We also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. This resulted in the selection of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global weighted-average targeted and actual asset allocations at September 30, by asset category, are:

The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the plan’s benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager.

As of

September 30, 2017

and


, our pension plans do not directly own our common stock.

In certain countries where we operate, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a separate pension fund.

The valuation methodologies used for our pension plans’ investments measured at fair value are described as follows. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at

September 30, 2017

and


.

Common stock

— Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

Mutual funds

— Valued at the net asset value (NAV) reported by the fund.

Corporate debt

— Valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.

Government securities

— Valued at the most recent closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or, absent an active market, utilizing observable inputs such as closing prices in less frequently traded markets.

Common collective trusts

— Valued at the NAV as determined by the custodian of the fund. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding.

Private equity and alternative equity

— Valued at the estimated fair value, as determined by the respective fund manager, based on the NAV of the investment units held at year end, which is subject to judgment.

Real estate funds

— Consists of the real estate funds, which provide an indirect investment into a diversified and multi-sector portfolio of property assets.  Publicly-traded real estate funds are valued at the most recent closing price reported on the SIX Swiss Exchange.  The remainder is valued at the estimated fair value, as determined by the respective fund manager, based on the NAV of the investment units held at year end, which is subject to judgment.

Insurance contracts

— Valued at the aggregate amount of accumulated contribution and investment income less amounts used to make benefit payments and administrative expenses which approximates fair value.

Other

— Consists of other fixed income investments and common collective trusts with a mix of equity and fixed income underlying assets. Other fixed income investments are valued at the most recent closing price reported in the markets in which the individual securities are traded, which may be infrequently.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Refer to Note 9 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy.

In accordance with ASC Subtopic 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the line items presented in the consolidated financial statements. The guidance under this subtopic was effective for us starting in fiscal 2017 and is required to be adopted on a retrospective basis.

If all of the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, the net reduction to our income tax provision, including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets, could be up to

Environmental Matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at


Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by third parties.

Environmental remediation cost liabilities and related expected recoveries at

September 30, 2017

Includes

$47.5 million

Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise.

Conditional asset retirement obligations and related expected recoveries at

September 30, 2017

There have been no significant changes in liabilities incurred, liabilities settled, accretion expense or revisions in estimated cash flows for the periods ended

Other Matters

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (Continued)

We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. Currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. In some cases, the claims involve products from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our former Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us, which occurred on January 31, 2007. We are also responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against our former Rockwell International Corporation's divested measurement and flow control business. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising from our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. Following litigation against Nationwide Indemnity Company (Nationwide) and Kemper Insurance (Kemper), the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to Allen-Bradley, we entered into separate agreements on April 1, 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. In exchange for a lump sum payment, Kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to Allen-Bradley. Nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. We believe that this arrangement with Nationwide will continue to provide coverage for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability.

We also have rights to historic insurance policies that provide indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising out of certain asbestos liabilities relating to the divested measurement and flow control business. We initiated litigation against several insurers to pursue coverage for these claims, subject to each carrier's policy limits, and the case is now pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court. In September 2016, we entered into settlement agreements with certain insurance company defendants. In exchange for a lump sum payment, Lamorak Insurance Company bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations relating to the measurement and flow control business. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London and certain London Market Insurance Companies entered into a cost share agreement to pay a portion of future defense and indemnity costs for measurement and flow control asbestos claims. We believe this arrangement will continue to provide partial coverage for these asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of asbestos liability.

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.

In connection with the spin-offs of our former automotive business, semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the respective businesses, including environmental and intellectual property matters.

In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor Electric Company for costs and damages related to certain legal, legacy environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January 31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale.

Historically, claims that have been made under the indemnification agreements have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a particular period.

From 1975 to 1989, Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) operated the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado for the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE). In 1990, a class of landowners near Rocky Flats sued RIC and Dow Chemical, another former operator of the facility. In May 2016, the parties agreed to settle this case and the DoE authorized the settlement. Under the court approved settlement agreement, we and Dow Chemical agreed to pay

$375.0 million

in the aggregate to resolve the claims. Under RIC’s contract with the DoE and federal law, RIC was entitled to indemnification by the DoE for its portion of the settlement amount, which was

to the plaintiff class escrow fund. In January 2017, the DoE fulfilled its indemnification obligation by paying

$243.75 million

, and the full amount of RIC's obligation under the settlement agreement has now been transferred to the plaintiff class escrow fund.  As a result, we were not required to make any payment under the settlement agreement.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

September 30, 2017

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareowners’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended

September 30, 2017

. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

September 30, 2017

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

September 30, 2017

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2017

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

September 30, 2017

, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

September 30, 2017

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2017

has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect to implement additional functionality within our enterprise-wide information technology system which could result in enhancements and modifications to related internal controls over financial reporting during fiscal 2018.
