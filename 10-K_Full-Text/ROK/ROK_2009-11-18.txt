Item 1.

Business

General

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of
industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a
competitive advantage for their businesses. Our products and services are designed to meet our
customers’ needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to
market and reduce manufacturing business risk.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1996 in connection with a tax-free reorganization
completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense
businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, the former
Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D
Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners.
Boeing then acquired RIC. RIC was incorporated in 1928.

On January 31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor
repair services businesses. These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems
operating segment. We sold these businesses to Baldor Electric Company (Baldor) for $1.8 billion,
comprised of $1.75 billion in cash and approximately 1.6 million shares of Baldor common stock.
During 2007, we reported an after-tax gain on the sale of $868.2 million ($5.39 per diluted share).
The results of operations and gain on sale of these businesses are reported in income from
discontinued operations in the Financial Statements for all periods presented.



As used herein, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Rockwell Automation” include
subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.

Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy
Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on February 2, 2010 (the 2010 Proxy
Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7.

Geographic Information

In 2009, sales to customers in the United States accounted for 51 percent of our total sales.
Our principal markets outside of the United States are in Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Italy,
and Brazil. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

for a discussion of risks associated with our operations
outside of the United States. Sales and property information by major geographic area for each of
the past three years is contained in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.

Competition

Depending on the product or service involved, our competitors range from large diversified
businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation, to smaller companies that
specialize in niche products and services. Factors that influence our competitive position include
the breadth of our product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology leadership, knowledge of
customer applications, large installed base, established distribution network, quality of products
and services, price and global presence.

Distribution

In the United States and Canada, we sell our products primarily through independent
distributors that typically do not carry products that compete with Allen-Bradley

®

products. We sell large systems and service offerings principally through a direct sales force,
though opportunities are sometimes identified through distributors. Outside the United States and
Canada, we sell products through a combination of direct sales and sales through distributors.
Sales to our largest distributor in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were between 9 and 10 percent of our total
sales.

Research and Development

Our research and development spending for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007
was $170.0 million, $191.3 million, and $166.9 million, respectively. Customer-sponsored research
and development was not significant in 2009, 2008 or 2007.



Employees

At September 30, 2009 we had approximately 19,000 employees. Approximately 8,300 were
employed in the United States, and, of these employees, about two percent were represented by
various local or national unions.

Raw Materials and Supplies

We purchase many items of equipment, components and materials used to produce our products
from others. The raw materials essential to the conduct of each of our business segments generally
are available at competitive prices. Although we have a broad base of suppliers and
subcontractors, we depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance
and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

We own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and
operations. Various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have
been made to us. We believe that none of these claims or requests will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition. While in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important
in the operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them
would materially affect our business or financial condition. See Item 1A.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance, and financial risks.
These risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Many of our
most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We can mitigate these
risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process is
a company wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and giving risks appropriate
consideration. We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to assess,
manage, and monitor risks.

A council of senior executives prioritizes identified risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and
assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to mitigate risks, where
possible. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and reviews identified risks deemed most
significant. The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to
monitor and seek to control them.

Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with strategic planning, with
the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our
results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.

We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the
risks of doing business in many countries.

Approximately 49 percent of our revenues in 2009 were outside of the U.S. Future growth rates
and success of our business depend in large part on growth in our non-U.S. sales. Numerous risks
and uncertainties affect our non-U.S. operations. These risks and uncertainties include political
and economic instability, changes in laws, regulations and policies, including those related to
tariffs, investments, taxation, trade controls, employment regulations and repatriation of
earnings, and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. International transactions
may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs,
including risks of non-compliance with U.S. and local laws affecting our activities abroad. In
addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and
interest rates. While these factors and their impacts are difficult to predict, any one or more of
them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.

An inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for
our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the
changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new
products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and
costly. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to
changes in customer preferences, demand for our products could decline and our operating results
would be adversely affected.



A global recession, adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and
disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in additional decreases in our revenues
and profitability.

Recent global economic events, including the tightening of credit markets and the failures or
material deteriorations of financial institutions and other entities, have resulted in a global
recession. If these conditions continue or worsen, we could experience additional declines in
revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain
disruptions or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective
customers and suppliers.

Demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global or regional industrial
production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve. As economic activity
slows or credit markets tighten, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, which
could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our ability to access the credit markets, and the related costs of these borrowings, is
affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions. If our access to
credit, including the commercial paper market, is adversely affected due to a change in market
conditions or otherwise, our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may
be reduced.

Information technology infrastructure failures could disrupt our business.

We depend heavily on our information technology (IT) infrastructure in order to achieve our
business objectives. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, a problem with
the functioning of an important IT application, a breach of security or an intentional disruption
of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders,
manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course.
Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur
significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns.

We are implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that will redesign and
deploy new processes, organization structures and a common information system over a period of
several years. Significant roll-outs of the system occurred at our U.S. locations and certain
locations in Mexico and Europe in 2007 to 2009, and are scheduled to continue at additional
locations in 2010 and beyond. As we implement the ERP system, the new system may not perform as
expected. This could have an adverse effect on our business.

There are inherent risks in our growing solutions businesses.

Risks inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming greater responsibility
for project completion and success, defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing
projects, and managing the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors. If we are unable to
control, manage, and mitigate these risks, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our industry is highly competitive.

We face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects. We
compete based on product performance, quality, integrated systems and applications that address our
customers’ business challenges, pricing and customer service. The relative importance of these
factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve. We seek to maintain acceptable
pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product
enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems. If we fail to
keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services, we may
experience price erosion and lower revenues and margins. We expect the level of competition to
remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share
or profitability.



A disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our revenues.

In the United States and Canada, approximately 90 percent of our sales is through a limited
number of distributors. In certain other countries, the majority of our sales is also through a
limited number of distributors. While we maintain the right to appoint new distributors, any
unplanned disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our revenues. A disruption
could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of a
distributor, or other events.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims) could increase our
costs.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to
the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, safety and health,
employment and contract matters. We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal
injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago.
The uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the
collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these
divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us
related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain
liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law.
In some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that
we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.

Intellectual property infringement claims could harm our business and our customers.

Others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. We
regularly provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and
conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties.
Indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costly. In addition, we own the
rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business.
The loss of patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business may have an adverse
effect on our results of operations. Expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property
rights could be significant.

We rely on vendors to supply raw materials, including commodities, which creates certain risks and
uncertainties that may adversely affect our business.

Our manufacturing processes require that we buy a high volume of equipment, components and raw
materials, including commodities such as copper, aluminum and steel. Our reliance on suppliers of
these raw materials involves certain risks, including:

•

poor quality can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our products;

•

the cost of these purchases may change due to inflation, exchange rates, commodity
market volatility or other factors;

•

we may not be able recover any increase in costs for these purchases through price
increases to our customers; and

•

a shortage of components, commodities or other materials could adversely affect our
manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery.

Any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete.
We also maintain several single-source supplier relationships, because either alternative sources
are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support,
delivery, capacity, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source
components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in a timely
manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with
our higher volume and more profitable products. Even where alternative sources of supply are
available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or
could result in delays and a loss of revenues.



Potential liabilities and costs for environmental remediation could reduce our profits.

Our operations, both in the United States and abroad, are subject to regulation by various
environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health,
the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground and waters, the quality
of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances.
Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change. Our financial responsibility to
clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or
used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals, as well as
properties that we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable
to prior owners. We have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be
so named in the future, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be
significant.

We must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our
tax expense and financial position.

We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and
rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those
jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax
liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims by taxing authorities related
to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.

Our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity
initiatives.

Our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to
our customers and identified growth opportunities. Localization of our products and services
includes expanding our capabilities, including supply chain and sourcing activities, product
design, manufacturing, engineering, marketing and sales and support. These activities expose us to
risks, including those related to political and economic uncertainties, transportation delays,
labor market disruptions, and challenges to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we
continue with our initiative to invest in actions to reduce our cost structure. The failure to
achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

We face the potential harms of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts
or other disruptions to our operations.

Natural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the
actions taken by governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our
business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create political or economic
instability. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these
events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver
products.

Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key
employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations
and administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key
employees could have a negative effect on our operating results.

Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us.

We have acquired, and will continue to acquire, businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner
value. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including:

•

difficulties in integrating the acquired business, retaining the acquired business’
customers, and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as revenue
increases, cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired
time frames;

•

loss of key employees of the acquired business;

•

difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures,
policies and information systems; and

•

diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.

Future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense,
restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.

Properties

At September 30, 2009, we operated 55 plants. Manufacturing space occupied approximately 4.8
million square feet, of which 52 percent was in the United States and Canada. Our Architecture &
Software segment occupied approximately 0.7 million square feet, our Control Products & Solutions
segment occupied approximately 2.9 million square feet and the remaining approximately 1.2 million
square feet of manufacturing space was shared by our operating segments. We also had 269 sales and
administrative offices and a total of 28 warehouses, service centers and other facilities. The
aggregate floor space of our facilities was approximately 10.6 million square feet. Of this floor
space, we owned approximately 22 percent and leased approximately 78 percent. At September 30,
2009, approximately 266,000 square feet of floor space was not in use, mostly in owned facilities.

There are no major encumbrances (other than financing arrangements, which in the aggregate are
not significant) on any of our plants or equipment. In our opinion, our properties have been well
maintained, are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to
operate at present levels.

RIC operated the Rocky Flats Plant (the Plant), Golden, Colorado, from
1975 through December 1989 for the Department of Energy (DOE). Incident to Boeing’s acquisition of
RIC in 1996, we agreed to indemnify RIC and Boeing for any liability arising out of RIC’s
activities at the Plant to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the U.S.
government.

On January 30, 1990, a class action was filed in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado against RIC and another former operator of the Plant. The action alleges the
improper production, handling and disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances,
constituting, among other things, violations of various environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations, and misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto. On October 8,
1993, the court certified separate medical monitoring and property value classes. Effective August
1, 1996, the DOE assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants, including RIC, in the
action and has either reimbursed or paid directly the costs of RIC’s defense. On February 14,
2006, a jury empanelled to try certain of the class action plaintiffs’ property damage claims found
the contractor defendants liable for trespass and nuisance, and awarded $176 million in
compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages against the two defendants. The jury
also found RIC to be 10% responsible for the trespass and 70% responsible for the nuisance. On
June 2, 2008, the district court entered judgment against RIC in the amount of $598 million,
including prejudgment interest. RIC has appealed the judgment, at the direction of the DOE.
Execution of the judgment is currently stayed. By letter dated June 5, 2008, the DOE confirmed its
obligation to indemnify RIC for any judgment or settlement arising out of this action and
attorney’s fees and other costs associated with this action, and acknowledged that the ultimate
financial responsibility for this action lies with the U.S. government. Accordingly, we do not
believe that the action will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

On May 4, 2005, RIC filed a claim with the DOE, seeking recovery of $11.3 million in
unreimbursed costs incurred in defense of a qui tam suit against RIC related to Rocky Flats. On
September 30, 2005, the DOE Contracting Officer denied that claim and demanded repayment of $4
million in previously reimbursed defense costs. On November 10, 2005, RIC appealed both aspects of
the Contracting Officer’s decision regarding defense costs to the Civilian Board of Contract
Appeals (Board). On July 9, 2007, the Board ruled that RIC was not entitled to be reimbursed for
costs incurred by it in defense of the qui tam action and that the DOE was entitled to be repaid
the previously reimbursed costs. As a result of further proceedings, on December 17, 2008 the
Board held allowable those costs incurred by RIC in defense of claims other than the claims on
which it was found liable in the qui tam case. The actual amounts that RIC may be required to repay
to the DOE and that the DOE must reimburse RIC will be determined in further proceedings. The DOE
has appealed the Board’s previous ruling in that proceeding, and RIC has cross-appealed.



McGregor, Texas NWIRP Facility Environmental Claim.

RIC operated the Naval Weapons
Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) in McGregor, Texas from 1958 through 1978 for the United States
Navy. Incident to Boeing’s acquisition of RIC in 1996, we agreed to indemnify RIC and Boeing for
any liability arising out of RIC’s activities at the NWIRP to the extent such liability is not
assumed or indemnified by the U.S. government.

On December 3, 2007, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) notified RIC that the
United States Navy was seeking to recover environmental cleanup costs incurred at the NWIRP. The
DOJ now asserts that it has incurred more than $50 million (excluding interest, attorneys fees and
other indirect costs) in environmental cleanup costs at the NWIRP, and it believes that it may have
a potential cause of action against RIC and other former contractors at the NWIRP for recovery of
those costs. Along with the initial notification, the DOJ also proposed a tolling agreement so
that the parties could discuss settlement. RIC and several other former contractors have entered
into the tolling agreement with the DOJ. To date, no lawsuit has been filed and only one
settlement discussion has taken place. Moreover, we believe that RIC has several meritorious
defenses to the DOJ’s claim. At this time, RIC has indicated that it cannot estimate its potential
exposure in this matter, if any, but it intends to continue discussion with the DOJ.

Asbestos.

We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits
alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of
our products many years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us
as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. In some cases, the claims involve
products from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have
agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our
Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their
divestiture by us, which occurred on January 31, 2007. We also are responsible for half of the
costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against RIC’s divested measurement and flow
control business. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our
products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe
we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the
encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical
condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have
been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over
and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising from our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary.
Following litigation against Nationwide Indemnity Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance
carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to Allen-Bradley, we entered into separate
agreements on April 1, 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for
ongoing and future coverage of Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. In exchange for a lump sum payment,
Kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations
to Allen-Bradley. Nationwide administers the Kemper buyout funds and has entered into a cost share
agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for
Allen-Bradley asbestos claims once the Kemper buyout funds are depleted. We believe that these
arrangements will continue to provide coverage for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims throughout the
remaining life of the asbestos liability.

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the
ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse
rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject
to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe
these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.



Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

. As a result of an internal review, we determined during the
fourth quarter of 2006 that actions by a small number of employees at certain of our operations in
one jurisdiction may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other
applicable laws. We and some of our distributors do business in this jurisdiction with government
owned enterprises or government owned enterprises that are evolving to commercial businesses.
These actions involved payments for non-business travel expenses and certain other business
arrangements involving potentially improper payment mechanisms for legitimate business expenses.
Special outside counsel has been engaged to investigate the actions and report to the Audit
Committee. Their review is ongoing.

We voluntarily disclosed these actions to the DOJ and the SEC beginning in September 2006. We
have implemented thorough remedial measures, and are cooperating on these issues with the DOJ and
SEC. We have agreed to update the DOJ and SEC periodically regarding any further developments as
the investigation continues.

If violations of the FCPA occurred, we may be subject to consequences that could include
fines, penalties, other costs and business-related impacts. We could also face similar
consequences from local authorities. We do not believe the consequences of this investigation, the
remediation or any related penalties or business related impacts will have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Other.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or
asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product
liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract
matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits,
claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters
that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
financial condition.

Overview

We are a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information
solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses. Overall
demand for our products and services is driven by:

•

investments in manufacturing, including upgrades, modifications, and expansions of
existing facilities, and the creation of new facilities;

•

our customers’ needs for greater cost reduction, sustainable production (cleaner, safer
and more energy efficient), productivity, quality assurance and overall global
competitiveness;

•

industry factors that include our customers’ new product introductions, trends in the
actual and forecasted demand for our customers’ products or services, and the regulatory
and competitive environments in which our customers operate;

•

levels of global industrial production and capacity utilization;

•

regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic
circumstances; and

•

the seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes
and their working schedules.

Long-term Strategy

Our strategic framework incorporates our vision of being the most valued global provider of
innovative industrial automation and information products, services and solutions, and our growth
and performance strategy, which seeks to:

•

deploy human and financial resources to strengthen our technology leadership and
allow us to capture a larger share of our customers’ spending and continue to transform
our business model into one that is based less on tangible assets and more on
intellectual capital;

•

expand our served market by increasing our capabilities in new applications,
including process control, safety and information software;

•

enhance our market access by increasing our solutions and service capabilities,
advancing our global presence and delivering our products and solutions to a wider
range of industries;

•

build our channel capability and partnerships and increase penetration at OEMs;

•

look for potential acquisitions that serve as catalysts to organic growth, add
complementary technology, expand our served market, increase our domain expertise or
continue our geographic diversification; and

•

drive continuous improvement by driving quality into all we do, improving customer
experience and satisfaction, driving aggressive productivity and optimizing end-to-end
business processes.



Technological Advancement and Domain Expertise

We seek a technology leadership position in all facets of plant-wide control. We believe our
core technologies are the foundation for long-term sustainable growth at a multiple of global Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth.

Our customers face increasingly complex and volatile customer demand patterns, which are
driving the need for flexible manufacturing. Our investments in new technology and domain
expertise have expanded our served market beyond discrete control into process, safety and
information. Our value proposition is to help our customers gain the benefits of faster time to
market, lower total cost of ownership, better asset utilization and reduced business risks.

We believe that process automation is the largest growth opportunity for our company. Our
Logix architecture enables us to compete effectively with traditional Distributed Control Systems
(DCS) solutions for many process applications. Our Logix architecture can integrate information
across the plant floor to the enterprise systems and the external supply chain. Our Logix
architecture continues to be an important differentiator and the anchor of our comprehensive
automation offerings.

We have one of the most comprehensive safety offerings in the industry, including both machine
and process safety products and solutions. We see significant potential in the growing safety
market. We successfully integrated safety into the Logix platform with our launch of
GuardLogix

®

safety controllers. Our safety products are designed to bring a dual benefit
to our customers: a safe environment for their employees and productivity in their operations.

Through internal investment and acquisitions, we have expanded our capability in the area of
plant-wide information. This opportunity involves optimizing processes and assets while
integrating between the plant floor, the enterprise business system and the supply chain.

Our broad power and motor control offering is one of our core competencies. Many of our motor
control products are intelligent and configurable. These products enhance the availability,
efficiency and safe operation of our customers’ critical plant assets.

We augment our product portfolio with solutions and service offerings. We have expanded our
portfolio of repeatable solutions, which enables us to gain efficiency, drive innovation and
improve the global deployment of our solutions to our customers. The combination of our leading
technologies with the industry-specific domain expertise of our people enables us to solve many of
our customers’ manufacturing challenges.

Global Expansion and Enhanced Market Access

As the manufacturing world continues to globalize, we must be able to meet our customers’
needs in emerging markets. We expect to continue to add delivery resources and expand our sales
force in emerging markets over the long term. We currently have more than half of our employees
outside the U.S., and achieved our goal of about 50 percent of our revenues outside of the U.S.
during 2008.

As we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we
expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products, services and solutions that we provide to
our customers in these regions. We have made significant investments to globalize our
manufacturing and customer facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the
world. The emerging markets of Asia Pacific, including China and India, Latin America and middle
and eastern Europe have the potential to exceed global GDP rates, due to higher levels of
infrastructure investment and the growing role of consumer spending in these markets. We believe
that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment
and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.

OEMs represent another growth opportunity. The OEM market is large and we have an opportunity
to increase market share within it, particularly outside of North America. To remain competitive,
OEMs need to continually improve their costs and machine performance and reduce their time to
market. Our modular and scaleable Logix offering, particularly when combined with motion and
safety, can assist OEMs in addressing these business needs.



Industry Views

We apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business
challenges. We serve customers in a wide range of industries, including consumer, resource-based
and transportation.

Our consumer industry customers are engaged in the food and beverage, home and personal care
and life sciences industries. These customers’ needs include global expansion, incremental capacity
from existing facilities, an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory
compliance. In addition, these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and
time to market are critical factors.

We serve customers in resource-based industries, including oil and gas, mining, aggregates,
cement, metals, water/wastewater and forest products. Companies in these industries typically
invest when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is
increasing.

In the transportation industry, factors such as geographic expansion, investment in new model
introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers’ purchasing
decisions regarding our products, services and solutions.

Demand for our products, services and solutions across all industries benefits from the
outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers. Customers increasingly desire to outsource
engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base. Our manufacturing application knowledge
enables us to serve these customers globally. We help our customers meet their sustainability
needs pertaining to energy efficiency, environmental and safety goals. Higher energy prices have
historically caused customers across all industries to invest in more energy-efficient
manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor controls and energy efficient
solutions and services. In addition, environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to
invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices.

Acquisitions

In March 2009, we bought a majority of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the
automation business of Rutter Hinz Inc., which is expected to accelerate our business growth in
Canada and in the oil and gas and other resource-based industries. In January 2009, we bought the
assets and assumed certain liabilities of Xi’an Hengsheng Science & Technology Limited. This
acquisition advances our globalization strategy and strengthens our ability to deliver project
management and engineering solutions primarily to our customers in China.

During 2008 we acquired CEDES Safety & Automation AG (CEDES), Incuity Software, Inc. (Incuity)
and Pavilion Technologies, Inc. (Pavilion). With our acquisition of CEDES, we have expanded our
comprehensive machine safety component portfolio. CEDES is a supplier of safety and measuring
light curtains, a leading product offering in the machine safety market. Incuity positions us for
continued success in the information solutions market. Incuity’s enterprise manufacturing
intelligence offerings, which we have named FactoryTalk

®

VantagePoint, enable us to
accelerate specific aspects of our plant-wide information strategy and extend the capabilities of
our integrated architecture. We believe that Pavilion’s expertise in advanced process control,
production optimization and environmental compliance solutions, paired with our Logix architecture,
positions us to help our customers create a more agile, efficient and productive environment. It
also benefits, in particular, our process growth initiative.

We believe the acquired companies will help us expand our market share and deliver value to
our customers.

Continuous Improvement

Productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture. We have
programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement, functional streamlining, material cost
savings and manufacturing productivity. We are in the process of developing and implementing common
global processes and an enterprise-wide information system. These are intended to improve
profitability that can be used to fund investment in growth and technology and to offset inflation.
Our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost and improved asset utilization. Charges for
workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute
our productivity programs.



U. S. Industrial Economic Trends

In 2009, sales to U.S. customers accounted for 51 percent of our total sales. The various
indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our U.S. served markets include:

•

The Industrial Production Index (Total Index), published by the Federal Reserve, which
measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The
Industrial Production Index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year,
currently 2002. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the Industrial
Production Index and the level of capital investment made by our U.S. customers in their
manufacturing base.

•

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), published by the Institute for
Supply Management (ISM), which is an indication of the current and near-term state of
manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates
that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50
indicates that it is generally contracting.

•

Industrial Equipment Spending, which is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad
U.S. industrial economy. This measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a
reasonable correlation with our domestic growth.

•

Capacity Utilization (Total Industry), which is an indication of plant operating
activity published by the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful
correlation between Capacity Utilization and levels of U.S. industrial production.

The table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2007 to 2009. Recent trends
in most metrics show signs of possible stabilization; however, we continue to operate in a period
of uncertainty with respect to the U.S. economy.

Non-U.S. Regional Trends

In 2009, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 49 percent of our total sales. Outside the
U.S., demand for our products and services is principally driven by the strength of the industrial
economy in each region and by our customers’ ability and propensity to invest in their
manufacturing assets. These customers include both multinational companies with expanding global
presence and indigenous companies. Demand has historically been driven, in part, by:

•

investments in infrastructure in developing economies;

•

investments in basic materials production capacity, partly in response to higher end-product pricing; and

•

expanding consumer markets.

We use changes in GDP as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do
business. GDP either declined or grew slowly in all regions during fiscal 2009, contributing to
reduced customer demand. We have observed the most significant effects of the GDP deceleration in
the developed economies of Canada, Western Europe and Asia Pacific, all of which experienced
year-over-year GDP declines. We also saw GDP declines in Latin America, beginning in the second
fiscal quarter of 2009. GDP growth rates in certain Asia Pacific emerging economies exceeded the
global average, as growth in these economies began to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2009.
Signs indicating potential stabilization in global economic conditions began to appear in the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, but the market outlook in all regions continues to remain uncertain.

Summary of Results of Operations

Our 2009 results reflect the severity of the global economic recession. Market conditions
quickly deteriorated across most industries and all regions. Turmoil
in the financial markets intensified the economic decline and was a contributing factor in most industrial companies’
decisions to slow production, reduce spending and conserve cash. All of these factors contributed
to 2009 being one of the most challenging years in our history.

In this economic environment, we experienced a full year organic revenue decline of 19
percent. However, we saw demand levels in our products business start to stabilize in the latter
part of the year and our revenue grew sequentially in the fourth
quarter of 2009. While macroeconomic conditions appear to be
stabilizing, the outlook for manufacturing investment remains
uncertain.

During 2009, we acted decisively throughout the year to right-size our cost structure,
allowing us to achieve cost savings in 2009 and expected incremental cost savings in 2010. These
actions required us to record restructuring charges of $60.4 million ($41.8 million after tax, or
$0.29 per diluted share). We carefully balanced these actions with preserving investments in our
core technologies and global domain expertise. We also generated significant cash flow this year
by quickly aligning inventory levels to lower demand, effectively managing receivables in a
difficult credit environment and appropriately constraining capital spending. Our balance sheet
and liquidity position remain strong.

We will continue our operating discipline, with a focus on cost control and cash management,
into 2010. We believe our ongoing commitment to innovation, technology differentiation, domain
expertise and thought leadership will enable us to continue to meet our customers’ global
productivity and sustainability needs.

Sales

Sales decreased 24 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The effects of currency translation
contributed 5 percentage points to the decrease. We experienced a significant decline in customer
demand during 2009 due to deteriorating economic, financial and credit market conditions in most
regions and industries. Sales to customers in the United States declined 22 percent organically as
compared to 2008, as plant shutdowns occurred and production slowed across many industries. The
Canadian organic sales decline of 28 percent compared to 2008 was driven by weakness in all
industrial sectors, including transportation and general manufacturing. Sales to customers in EMEA
declined 19 percent organically compared to 2008. EMEA weakness occurred in all industries as well
as in sales to OEMs, due to a large number of plant shutdowns and production cutbacks. Organic
sales in Asia-Pacific declined by 11 percent compared to 2008. Korea and Japan contributed most to
the decline in the region. Organic sales in Latin America declined by 6 percent as compared to
2008. The Latin America region benefited from demand in resource-based industries during the first
two quarters of the year, but experienced year-over-year organic
sales declines in the second half of the year.

In 2009 we experienced significant year-over-year declines in all of our end markets,
including transportation, metals, and to a lesser extent, consumer products industries. However,
the decline in process sales was lower than our average rate of decline.

Purchase Accounting Depreciation and Amortization

Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was $18.6 million in 2009 compared to $24.2
million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to completed amortization of certain intangible
assets and currency translation.

General Corporate — Net

General corporate expenses were $80.3 million in 2009 compared to $77.2 million in 2008. The
increase was primarily due to increased charitable contributions and a gain recognized in the first
nine months of 2008 in connection with the divestiture of Power Systems, partially offset by cost
reductions.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $60.9 million in 2009 compared to $68.2 million in 2008. The decrease
was due to lower interest rates and lower short-term debt balances.



Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2009 was 20.4 percent compared to 28.6 percent in 2008. The 2009
and 2008 effective tax rates were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent because we benefited
from lower tax rates on income outside the United States and in 2008
we benefited from the use of foreign tax credits.

The 2009 rate was lower than 2008 because we benefited from a lower proportionate share of
income in higher tax rate jurisdictions as compared to 2008. During 2009, we also recognized
discrete tax benefits of $20.5 million related to the retroactive extension of the U.S. federal
research tax credit, the resolution of a contractual tax obligation and various state tax matters,
partially offset by discrete tax expenses of $4.2 million related to a non-U.S. subsidiary.

See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States
statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2009 and 2008
affecting the respective tax rates.

Income from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased 62 percent in 2009 to $217.9 million, compared to
2008. The decrease is primarily due to our significant decline in sales volume. Inflation, the
unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the
decrease. These items were partially offset by cost reductions, lower interest expense and a lower
effective tax rate.

During 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $60.4 million ($41.8 million after tax, or
$0.29 per diluted share) related to actions designed to better align our cost structure with
current economic conditions. We recorded $35.2 million of the restructuring charges as a reduction
of Architecture & Software operating earnings and $25.2 million as a reduction of Control Products
& Solutions operating earnings. Special items of $4.0 million in 2009 include the reversal of a
portion of restructuring accruals established in prior years.

During 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $50.7 million ($34.0 million after tax, or
$0.23 per diluted share) related to actions designed to better align resources with growth
opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions. This
charge was partially offset by the reversal of $4.0 million ($3.6 million net of tax or $0.02 per
diluted share) of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions, as
employee attrition differed from our original estimates. We recorded these net charges in special
items in 2008.

translation contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the decline. We experienced year-over-year declines in
sales of this segment as a result of the global recession and the short-cycle nature of this
segment’s sales activities. Logix sales declined 17
percent in 2009 compared to 2008, while the decline in sales of our legacy processor products was
greater than the segment’s average rate of decline.

Operating Margin

Architecture & Software segment operating margin decreased by 11.3 points to 12.9 percent in
2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to significant declines in sales volume. The
unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the

rate than the segment’s average rate of decline, as we delivered solutions from our backlog.

Operating Margin

Control Products & Solutions segment operating margin decreased by 5.5 points to 7.9 percent
in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from significant declines in sales
volume. Inflation, the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also

Sales

Sales increased 14 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Organic sales increased 6 percent, with
effects of currency translation and acquisitions adding 5 and 3 percentage points to the growth
rate, respectively. In 2008, we continued the execution of our ongoing globalization strategy and
our focus on emerging markets, as approximately 50 percent of our sales during 2008 were to
non-U.S. customers. Sales in emerging markets grew at above our average growth rate. We
demonstrated improved performance in the Asia-Pacific region, with particular strength in China and
India. The growth rate in Asia-Pacific accelerated every quarter during 2008, resulting in a full
year organic growth rate of 15 percent compared to 2007. We continued to see strong organic growth
in Latin America of 14 percent, benefiting from strength in resource-based industries. Sales to
customers in the United States, Canada and EMEA each grew at 4-5 percent organically.

In 2008, we experienced considerable growth in our key process and OEM growth initiatives,
demonstrating the ongoing diversification of our revenue base. We achieved above average growth in
resource-based industries, primarily due to higher commodity prices, infrastructure spending and
continued demand for oil, gas and other resources, particularly in emerging markets. Sales to
global automotive customers grew at about our average growth rate, but U.S. automotive growth was
below our average growth rate. Sales to customers in the life sciences industries were
significantly below our average growth rate. Our sales growth in the food and beverage and home
and personal care industries was also below our average growth rate; however, these industries tend
to provide for more consistent rates of growth over time.

Purchase Accounting Depreciation and Amortization

Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was $24.2 million in 2008 compared to $16.4
million in 2007. The increase was due to amortization of intangibles from recent acquisitions,
particularly CEDES, Incuity, Pavilion and Industrial Control Services Group Limited, which does
business as ICS Triplex.



General Corporate — Net

General corporate expenses were $77.2 million in 2008 compared to $72.8 million in 2007. The
increase was primarily due to lower interest and dividend income in 2008 compared to 2007,
partially offset by reduced charitable contributions in 2008 and lower environmental remediation
charges at legacy sites compared to 2007.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $68.2 million in 2008 compared to $63.4 million in 2007. The increase
was due to higher average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by lower interest rates than the
prior year.

Special Items

In 2008, we incurred special charges of $50.7 million ($34.0 million after tax, or $0.23 per
diluted share) related to restructuring actions designed to better align resources with growth
opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions. This
charge was partially offset by the reversal of $4.0 million ($3.6 million net of tax or $0.02 per
diluted share) of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions as
employee attrition differed from our original estimates. The 2008 restructuring actions include
workforce reductions aimed at streamlining administrative functions, realigning selling resources
to the highest anticipated growth opportunities and consolidating business units.

Special items of $43.5 million in 2007 include costs related to various restructuring actions
designed to execute on our cost productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy.
Actions included workforce reductions, realignment of administrative functions and rationalization
and consolidation of global operations.

See Note 14 in the Financial Statements for more information on restructuring charges and
special items.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2008 was 28.6 percent compared to 27.8 percent in 2007. The
effective tax rate in 2008 was lower than the statutory tax rate of 35 percent because of lower tax
rates on income outside the United States and because we used foreign tax credits. The tax rate in
2008 was higher than 2007 because we favorably resolved various federal and state matters in the
prior year.

The 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we
benefited from lower non-U.S. tax rates, resolved certain tax matters and claims related to the
closure of the 2005 U.S. federal audit cycle and various state tax audits and made other provision
adjustments.

See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States
statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2008 and 2007
affecting the respective tax rates.

Income from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations in 2008 increased $8.3 million compared to 2007. The
increase was primarily due to productivity performance and higher volume, partially offset by
increased investment spending to support globalization, growth and technology, increased purchase
accounting depreciation and amortization, inflation and a higher effective income tax rate.

Discontinued Operations

Amounts reported for discontinued operations in 2007 primarily relate to the operating results
of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment for periods before the
divestiture and the gain on sale of the principal businesses of that operating segment. Net income
on operating activities of Power Systems was $42.3 million in 2007. We reported an after-tax gain
on the sale of Power Systems of $868.2 million ($5.39 per share) in 2007.

We also reported after-tax income of $8.0 million during 2007 related to other discontinued
operations activities. See Note 13 in the Financial Statements for more information on
discontinued operations.

Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into
consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute
our strategy. Our accounting for share-based compensation requires us to report the excess income
tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating
cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to
generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. In our opinion,
free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from
business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt
principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and
evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other
companies.

Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures
related to our discontinued operations. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our
discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. Cash flows from
the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows
net of their separately calculated income tax effects. U.S. federal and state income taxes paid as
a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating
segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds. These
taxes paid in 2008 and 2007 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that
is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses.

Free cash flow was a source of $430.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 compared
to a source of $458.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. This decrease in free cash
flow was primarily due to a decrease in current year earnings and an increase in payments related
to restructuring actions, partially offset by improvements in working capital resulting from our
lower sales volume, refunds related to a contractual tax matter and lower capital expenditures.

In December 2007, we issued an aggregate of $500 million principal amount of our 5.65% notes
due 2017 and 6.25% debentures due 2037. The debt offering yielded approximately $493.5 million of
proceeds, which were used to repay at maturity our 6.15% notes due January 15, 2008 and for general
corporate purposes.

In January 2007, we received $1.75 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our Dodge
mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses. We used the cash
proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of the divestiture,
to pay taxes on the gain on sale and to acquire ICS Triplex.

Commercial paper is our principal source of short-term financing. At September 30, 2009, we
had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. At September 30, 2008, commercial paper borrowings
outstanding were $100.0 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2 percent.



In 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock, all of which
occurred in October 2008. The total cost of these shares was $50.0 million. This is compared to
purchases of approximately 6.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $355.1 million in
2008. Of these purchases, 0.1 million shares amounting to $3.5 million did not settle until
October 2008 and were recorded in accounts payable at September 30, 2008. Our decision to
repurchase stock in 2010 will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash
requirements and stock price. At September 30, 2009 we had approximately $621.2 million remaining
for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization. See Part II, Item 5,

Market for the
Company’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

, for
additional information regarding share repurchases.

We expect future uses of cash to include dividends to shareowners, capital expenditures,
additional contributions to our pension plans, acquisitions of businesses, repurchases of common
stock and repayments of debt. We expect capital expenditures in 2010 to be about $110 million. We
expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances, cash
generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other
securities.

In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing
sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our
debt-to-total-capital ratio was 40.7 percent at September 30, 2009 and 37.3 percent at September
30, 2008. This increase is primarily due to a $360.3 million reduction in shareowners’ equity, net
of tax, related to the funded status of our pension plans, which decreased as a result of lower
discount rates and a decrease in our pension plan assets.

On March 16, 2009 we replaced our former five-year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit
facility with two new unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $535.0 million. Both new
facilities have borrowing limits of $267.5 million each. One facility has a three-year term and the
other facility has a 364-day term. Our 364-day credit facility includes a term-out option that
allows us to borrow, on March 15, 2010, up to $267.5 million as a term loan for one year. We have
not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at September 30, 2009 or 2008. Borrowings under
these credit facilities bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the
period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under
which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were
in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at September 30, 2009 and 2008. In
addition to our two $267.5 million credit facilities, short-term unsecured credit facilities of
approximately $169.7 million at September 30, 2009 were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Among other uses, we can draw on our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to
repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing
commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the commercial paper ratings set forth in
the table above. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our
other borrowings under our credit facilities, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit
available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then
outstanding commercial paper as it matures.

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings,
is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. We have not experienced
any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. If our access to the commercial
paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would
expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to
provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed
credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.

We regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash
equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on
maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties
to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.



We enter into contracts to hedge certain third-party sales and intercompany transactions
denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset
transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated
in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other
transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward
exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We diversify our
foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of
these entities.

Cash dividends to shareowners were $164.5 million in 2009, $170.2 million in 2008, and $184.7
million in 2007 ($1.16 per share each year). Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.29 per
outstanding share, which is determined at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.

A summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at September 30, 2009 are (in millions):

(a)

The amounts for long-term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be
outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. The amounts include interest, but
exclude the unamortized discount of $45.3 million. See Note 6 in the Financial Statements
for more information regarding our long-term debt.

(b)

Our postretirement plans are unfunded and are subject to change. Amounts reported are
estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.

(c)

Amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates of known
commitments. Contributions to our pension plans beyond 2010 will depend on future
investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and
governmental regulations in effect at the time. Amounts subsequent to 2010 are excluded
from the summary above, as these amounts cannot be estimated with certainty. The minimum
contribution for our U.S. pension plan as required by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) is zero. We may make additional contributions to this plan at the
discretion of management.

(d)

This item includes long-term obligations under agreements with various service
providers.

(e)

Other long-term liabilities include environmental liabilities net of related
receivables, asset retirement obligations, and indemnifications. Amounts subsequent to
2010 are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable
estimate of when the liabilities will be paid.

(f)

Amount for unrecognized tax benefits includes accrued interest and penalties. We are
unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities for unrecognized tax
benefits will be settled or paid.

Supplemental Sales Information

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates
effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency rates affect our reported
sales. Sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic
sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and
acquisitions, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors
because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect
of changes in currency rates or acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and
evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates
by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect
during the prior year. We determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current
period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period. Organic sales growth is
calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. We attribute sales to
the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies
could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex
judgments by management.

Retirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions
used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan
assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, the retirement rate, the mortality rate and
the employee turnover rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences
between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future
periods.

Our global pension expense in 2009 was $32.7 million compared to $28.6 million in 2008.
Approximately 51 percent of our 2009 global pension expense relates to our U.S. pension plan. The
actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2009 U.S. pension expense included the following:
discount rate of 6.75 percent (compared to 6.50 percent for 2008); expected rate of return on plan
assets of 8.00 percent (compared to 8.00 percent for 2008); and an assumed long-term compensation
increase rate of 4.20 percent (compared to 4.15 percent for 2008).

We changed our measurement date in 2009 from June 30 to September 30 as required by U.S. GAAP.
We recorded a reduction in retained earnings of $8.2 million ($5.3 million net of tax) in the
fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law in August 2006. The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) issued final guidance with respect to certain aspects of this law; and, our 2009
pension plan valuation has been completed based on the final guidance. This valuation resulted in
no minimum contributions being required in 2009.

We estimate our pension expense will be approximately $71.2 million in 2010, an increase of
approximately $38.5 million from 2009. For 2010, our U.S. discount rate will decrease to 6.20
percent. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was determined by
modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. Our assumed
rate of return on U.S. plan assets will remain at 8.00 percent. We considered actual returns on
plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in
setting this assumption. We have assumed a U.S. long-term
compensation increase rate of 4.30
percent in 2010. We established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are
pension eligible earnings.

The changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with
our net periodic benefit cost. The change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship
with our projected benefit obligation. The following chart illustrates the estimated change in
benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key
assumption for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):

More information regarding pension benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial
Statements.



Other Postretirement Benefits

We estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using
assumptions, including the discount rate and, for plans other than our primary U.S. postretirement
healthcare benefit program, expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these
assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of
postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. The discount rate used to calculate
our 2009 other postretirement benefits expense was 6.50 percent (compared to 6.25 percent in 2008).
For 2010, the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to
6.00 percent. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was
determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans.

Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit
program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare
services. As a result of this amendment, our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare
costs resulting from inflationary trends since January 1, 2005.

We changed our measurement date in 2009 from June 30 to September 30 as required by U.S. GAAP.
We recorded a reduction in retained earnings of $4.0 million ($2.5 million net of tax) in the
fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change.

Net periodic benefit cost in 2009 was $15.8 million compared to $15.4 million in 2008. We
expect net periodic benefit cost in 2010 of approximately $14.0 million and the estimated
postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate $215.8 million.

More information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial
Statements.

Revenue Recognition

For approximately 80 percent of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection
is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be
required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts
using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of accounting. We record
sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract
method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross
profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and
total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion
method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue
in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are
identified.

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of
sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations
and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based
on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the
product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale
customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting
specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to
contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue
recognition based primarily on historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required
if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes
to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the
accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is
recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the
effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $6.1 million.



Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash
or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional
products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance
sheet or, where a right of offset exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The accrual for
customer returns, rebates and incentives was $116.1 million at September 30, 2009 and $137.8
million at September 30, 2008, of which $8.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $13.2 million at
September 30, 2008 was included as an offset to accounts receivable.

Fair Value Measurements

Share-based compensation

Share-based compensation expense net of the related income tax benefit amounted to $18.7
million in 2009, $21.5 million in 2008 and $18.8 million in 2007. Compensation costs are based on
the grant-date fair value of the instruments using a valuation model, and are recognized on a
straight line basis over the vesting term. We estimate the average risk-free interest rate,
expected dividend yield, expected volatility and expected term of the compensation instrument
outstanding in order to determine fair value of stock options granted. The valuation model is most
sensitive to the expected volatility and term assumptions.

Stock options granted during 2009 had a weighted average fair value of $7.75 per share. The
chart below illustrates the weighted average fair value assuming a 10 percent change in the
expected volatility and term assumptions:

Asset Retirement Obligations

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset
retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath
current and previously divested facilities. We estimate conditional asset retirement obligations
using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. A significant change in the costs
or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. We recorded these liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, which totaled $2.9 million in other current liabilities and $23.9
million in other liabilities at September 30, 2009 and $5.1 million in other current liabilities
and $22.8 million in other liabilities at September 30, 2008.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor
repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor for costs and damages related to certain
legacy legal, environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January 31,
2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale. We
recorded a liability and a reduction to the gain on sale under relevant U.S. GAAP guarantor
accounting rules related to these indemnification obligations. A significant change in the costs
or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. We estimate the potential future
payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate $25.9 million, of which $11.1
million and $10.5 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and $11.3 million and $12.9
million has been accrued in other liabilities at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Derivatives

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks. We enter
into these contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain
third-party and intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next two years (cash flow
hedges). We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate
as hedging instruments to offset transaction gains and losses associated with certain assets and
liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated
in foreign currencies. The fair value of all derivative financial instruments is recorded in the
balance sheet, which is based on the quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities.
Unrealized gains on derivative instruments are recorded in other current assets in the amounts of
$25.0 million and $6.1 million and in other assets in the amounts of $11.4 million and $5.1 million
at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Unrealized losses on derivative instruments are
recorded in other current liabilities in the amounts of $19.1 million and $16.2 million and in
other liabilities in the amounts of $9.4 million and $8.4 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Purchase Accounting, Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets

When we acquire a business, we account for the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value
at the date of acquisition. In order to value acquired identifiable intangible assets and determine
their amortizable lives, management must use judgment in selecting relevant assumptions. See Note
2 in the Financial Statements for a discussion of acquisitions in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

In years subsequent to the year of acquisition, we perform an annual impairment test on our
goodwill balance. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. We have
determined that our reporting units are our two operating segments: Control Products & Solutions
and Architecture & Software, as we have concluded that components one level below these segments do
not constitute reporting units.

We use a discounted cash flow valuation model to estimate the fair value of each of our
reporting units. We also compare the sum of the computed fair values of our reporting units to our
market capitalization to verify reasonableness. The fair value of each reporting unit determined
during the 2009 impairment test significantly exceeded the net asset book value of each reporting
unit. The valuation model is most sensitive to the discount rate, perpetuity growth rate and tax
rate assumptions. A ten percent change in any one of these assumptions would not change the outcome
of the goodwill impairment test, as the fair value of each reporting unit would continue to
significantly exceed the net asset book value. We have not changed our goodwill impairment testing
valuation techniques during the current year.

We also perform an annual impairment test on our Allen-Bradley

®

and ICS
Triplex

TM

trademarks, as these trademarks have an indefinite life and are not subject to
amortization. We use the relief-from-royalty method to determine the fair value of the trademarks,
which we compare to the book value to determine whether impairment is warranted. Inputs into the
model requiring the most judgment are revenue growth and discount factor. A ten percent change in
either one of these assumptions would not result in impairment of either of our indefinite lived
intangible assets.

Litigation, Claims and Contingencies

We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable
and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record
liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation
exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly
owned or operated and third-party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible
party. At third-party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified,
we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with
the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent
or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record
a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures
for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability
estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure
or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional
contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is
adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change.



Our reserve for environmental matters was $33.4 million, net of related receivables of $24.8
million, at September 30, 2009 and $33.2 million, net of related receivables of $22.8 million, at
September 30, 2008. Our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to
businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to
remediate. The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental
exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low. As a result of remediation
efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a
long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation
procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result
in increases to our environmental obligations.

Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability where we are self-insured up
to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by
policies issued by commercial insurers. We estimate the reserve for product liability claims using
our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the product liability reserves
may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends
or the outcome of claims. The reserve for product liability claims was $16.8 million at September
30, 2009 and $23.0 million at September 30, 2008.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us
relating to the conduct of our business. As described in Part I, Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

, we
have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. See Part I, Item 3
for further discussion.

More information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17 in the
Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by U.S.
Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the
rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our
income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings
in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations
of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those
jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax
audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or
assessments.

While we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns, taxing authorities may
assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions.
Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for
products, services, and/or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise
our more significant income tax exposures. We recognized a $6.7 million decrease in shareowners’
equity as of October 1, 2008 related to a change in accounting for uncertain tax positions in
accordance with changes in U.S. GAAP. The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
interest and penalties, was recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the
amount of $116.7 million at September 30, 2009 and $125.8 million at September 30, 2008. The amount
of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations
if recognized was $40.9 million at September 30, 2009 and $43.2 million at September 30, 2008. In
addition, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would be reported in discontinued
operations if recognized was $26.7 million at September 30, 2009 and $33.4 million at September 30,
2008. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense.
Total accrued interest and penalties were $27.6 million at September 30, 2009 and $26.0 million at
September 30, 2008. We believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of net unrecognized tax
benefits could be reduced by up to $26.8 million during the next 12 months as a result of the
resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations.

We recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net
operating loss and capital loss carryforwards (Carryforwards) and certain temporary differences in
the amount of $43.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $45.1 million at September 30, 2008 based on
the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation
allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the Carryforward amount will be
realized. Our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more Carryforwards than
currently expected.



At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate a base effective tax rate that we
expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income, permanent book
and tax differences and global tax planning strategies. We use this base rate to provide for income
taxes on a year-to-date basis, excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items
and items that are reported net of their related tax effects. We record the tax effect of
significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in
the period in which they occur.

More information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a
combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in
the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We sometimes use interest rate swap
contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These
risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains
and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions
denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency. Our objective is to
minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the
use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are denominated in currencies of
major industrial countries. The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is
an asset of $36.4 million and a liability of $28.5 million at September 30, 2009. We enter into
these contracts with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We do not
hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local
currency to U.S. dollars. In 2009, the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign
currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations, while in 2008 the
relative weakening of the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact. While future changes in foreign
currency exchange rates are difficult to predict, our revenues and profitability may be adversely
affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to 2009 levels.

Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
their functional currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset
the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. For such
assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts, a 10 percent
adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pre-tax income by
approximately $15 million.

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for
holding them. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange
rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange
contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency
exposure. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to
fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the
hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets,
liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately. The ineffective portion was not
significant in 2009 and 2008. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign
currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial
condition or results of operations.



The following table indicates the U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts by contractual
maturity dates and related weighted average contract exchange rates for our foreign currency
forward exchange contracts outstanding at September 30, 2009 (in millions, except for rates):

All of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual
transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future. We designated certain of these
contracts related to third-party sales or intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through
June 2011 as cash flow hedges under U.S. GAAP. The remaining foreign exchange contracts offset
actual underlying receivables and payables in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Interest Rate Risk

In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use
a combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest
rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.

Our short-term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. We
had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at September 30, 2009; at September 30, 2008, we had
outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $100.0 million with remaining maturities of six days at
a weighted average interest rate of 2.2 percent. The weighted average interest rate on our
commercial paper borrowings was 0.6 percent during 2009 and 2.9 percent during 2008. As these
obligations mature, we issued, and anticipate continuing to issue, additional short-term commercial
paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. Changes in market interest rates
on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. In 2009 and 2008, a 100 percent
increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by $0.6 million
and $7.9 million, respectively. We use a 100 percent hypothetical fluctuation as our actual
commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2008 and 2009.

We had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with carrying values of $904.7
million at September 30, 2009 and $904.4 million at September 30, 2008. The fair value of this
debt was $992.0 million at September 30, 2009 and $883.0 million at September 30, 2008. The
potential reduction in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10
percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the
debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their
maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our
results of operations or shareowners’ equity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of
industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a
competitive advantage for their businesses.

Basis of Presentation

Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements or the notes
thereto relate to our continuing operations. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date
and time of issuance of these financial statements on November 18, 2009.

On January 31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor
repair services businesses to Baldor Electric Company (Baldor). These were the principal
businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. These businesses are reported as a
discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned and controlled majority owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have the
ability to exert significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. These
affiliated companies are not material individually or in the aggregate to our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), which require us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items,
customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete
inventory; share-based compensation; acquisitions; product warranty obligations; retirement
benefits; litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters, conditional asset
retirement obligations and contractual indemnifications; and income taxes. We account for changes
to estimates and assumptions prospectively when warranted by factually based experience.

Revenue Recognition

Product and solution revenues consist of industrial automation power, control and information;
hardware and software products; and custom-engineered systems. Service revenues include
multi-vendor customer technical support and repair, asset management and optimization consulting
and training.

For approximately 80 percent of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection
is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be
required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts
using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of accounting. We record
sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract
method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross
profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and
total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion
method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue
in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are
identified.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies — (Continued)

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of
sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations
and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs
are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based
on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the
product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale
customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting
specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to
contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of sale based
primarily on historical experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction
of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized
in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a
current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of offset exists, as a reduction of
accounts receivable.

Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions

Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales,
value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenue).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of deposit with original
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Receivables

We record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general
matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are
stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $21.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $17.4
million at September 30, 2008. In addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain
customer returns, rebates and incentives of $8.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $13.2 million at
September 30, 2008.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or
average cost methods. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.

Property

Property, including internal use software, is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of
property using the straight-line method over 15 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 14
years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 10 years for computer hardware and internal use
software. We capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off replaced units. We
expense maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account
for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the
allocated amount is recorded as goodwill.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may be present. Any
excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We
perform an annual impairment test during the second quarter of our fiscal year.

We amortize certain customer relationships on an accelerated basis over the period of which we
expect the intangible asset to generate future cash flows. We amortize all other intangible assets
with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives
assigned range from 7 to 20 years for customer relationships, 3 to 17 years for technology and 3 to
10 years for other intangible assets.

Intangible assets also include costs of software developed by our software business to be
sold, leased or otherwise marketed. Amortization of developed computer software products is
calculated on a product-by-product basis as the greater of (a) the unamortized cost at the
beginning of the year times the ratio of the current year gross revenue for a product to the total
of the current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product, (b) the straight-line
amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product or (c) one-fourth of the
total deferred software cost for the project.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from
an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure
the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value
less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange
contracts to manage foreign currency risks. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain third-party sale and
intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next two years (cash flow hedges) and
changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and
other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. Our accounting method for
derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as hedges under
U.S. GAAP. It is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we
believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States
with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the
end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates
effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a
component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Currency transaction gains and losses are included
in the results of operations in the period incurred.

Research and Development Expenses

We expense research and development (R&D) costs as incurred; these costs were $170.0 million
in 2009, $191.3 million in 2008 and $166.9 million in 2007. We include R&D expenses in cost of
sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

Prior to October 1, 2007, we recorded a liability for income tax exposures when they were
probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated. Tax benefits related to claims were also
recognized when they became probable and reasonably estimable. When determining the probability
and the estimability of the liability or tax benefit, we considered the relevant tax law as applied
to us by the particular country, state, or other taxing authority.

Beginning October 1, 2007, we changed our accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance
with changes in U.S. GAAP. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. For tax
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the tax position to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. We recognize interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense.

Earnings Per Share

We present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of
outstanding share-based compensation awards, which requires us to compute total employee proceeds
as the sum of (a) the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award, (b) the amount of
unearned share-based compensation costs attributed to future services and (c) the amount of tax
benefits, if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the
award. Share-based compensation awards for which the total employee proceeds of the award exceed
the average market price of the same award over the period have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and
accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation awards
for the years ended September 30, 2009 (7.5 million shares), 2008 (2.8 million shares) and 2007
(1.4 million shares) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

The following table reconciles basic weighted average outstanding shares to diluted weighted

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize share-based compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards
generally on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award recipient. We report the
tax benefit from the tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in excess of
recognized compensation costs (excess tax benefits) as a financing cash flow rather than as an
operating cash flow.

Product and Workers’ Compensation Liabilities

We record accruals for product and workers’ compensation claims in the period in which they
are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product
liability and workers’ compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims
exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial
insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims
experience for the periods being valued.

Environmental Matters

We record accruals for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is
probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods
in which the estimated costs of remediation change. At environmental sites for which more than one
potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated
allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental
sites for which we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated
costs of remediation. We do not discount to their present value future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third
parties is probable, we record a receivable for the estimated recovery.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 2009-14,

Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

(ASU
2009-14). ASU 2009-14 changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both
tangible products and software elements, requires that hardware components of a tangible product
containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance and provides
guidance on how a vendor must allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement
that includes both tangible products and software. We adopted the guidance contained in ASU
2009-14 effective October 1, 2009, and we do not believe it will have a material effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

(ASU 2009-13). ASU 2009-13 establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price
of a deliverable, replaces the term “fair value” in the revenue allocation guidance with “selling
price,” eliminates the residual method of allocation by requiring that arrangement consideration be
allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price
method and requires that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is
consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. We
adopted the guidance contained in ASU 2009-13 effective October 1, 2009, and we do not believe it
will have a material effect on our financial statements and related disclosures.

In December 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that expands disclosures about plan
assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The expanded disclosures include
how investment allocation decisions are made, major categories of plan assets, inputs and valuation
techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements
using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and significant concentrations of
risk within plan assets. These disclosures will become effective for us at the end of fiscal 2010
and we do not believe they will have a material effect on our financial statements; we plan to
expand our relevant disclosures upon adoption.

In June 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that specifies that unvested share-based
awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating
securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the
two-class method. This guidance is effective for us in fiscal 2010, and may result in a reduction
in earnings per share of $0.01 in certain prior and future periods.

In April 2008

,

the FASB issued new accounting guidance that is intended to improve the
consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected
cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under U.S. GAAP. We adopted this guidance
effective October 1, 2009, and we do not believe it will have a material effect on our financial
statements and related disclosures.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies — (Continued)

In March 2008, the FASB ratified new accounting guidance that requires that all nonrefundable
maintenance deposits be accounted for as a deposit, and expensed or capitalized when underlying
maintenance is performed. If it is determined that an amount on deposit is not probable of being
used to fund future maintenance, it is to be recognized as expense at the time such determination
is made. We adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2009, and we do not believe it will have a
material effect on our financial statements and related disclosures.

In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires an acquirer to
recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at fair value. It also requires the acquirer to
recognize and measure the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain
purchase and prescribes how to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. It also provides guidance for the accounting of pre-acquisition gain and loss
contingencies and acquisition related transaction costs. We adopted this guidance effective
October 1, 2009, and we do not believe it will have a material effect on our financial statements
and related disclosures.

In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that establishes accounting and
reporting standards for the noncontrolling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated
financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation. We adopted this
guidance effective October 1, 2009, and we do not believe it will have a material effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in
developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability. We adopted this guidance for financial
assets and liabilities effective October 1, 2008, and for non-financial assets and liabilities
effective October 1, 2009. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material
effect on our financial statements for financial assets and liabilities; see Note 9 for the
expanded disclosures presented in accordance with its requirements. We do not believe the adoption
of this guidance for non-financial assets and liabilities will have a material effect on our
financial statements.

2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

In 2009, our Control Products & Solutions segment acquired the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Xi’an Hengsheng Science & Technology Company Limited (Hengsheng). Hengsheng delivers
automation solutions to the electrical power and other heavy process industries in central and
western China. It also acquired a majority of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the
automation business of Rutter Hinz Inc. (Hinz). Hinz offers industrial control systems engineering
and related support, with domain expertise in industrial automation, process control and power
distribution, specifically for the oil and gas industry, as well as other resource-based
industries. The aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was $30.7 million. We recorded
goodwill of $14.2 million and intangible assets of $8.4 million resulting from the preliminary
purchase price allocations of Hengsheng and Hinz. Intangible assets assigned include $1.2 million
to technology (8-year weighted average useful life), $5.9 million to customer relationships
(10-year weighted average useful life) and $1.3 million to other intangible assets (4-year weighted
average useful life). We expect $6.3 million of the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.

During 2008, our Architecture & Software segment acquired CEDES Safety & Automation AG
(CEDES), Incuity Software, Inc. (Incuity), and Pavilion Technologies, Inc. (Pavilion). The
aggregate purchase price of these three acquisitions was $112.9 million in cash.

We acquired CEDES in May 2008. Swiss-based CEDES is a supplier of safety and measuring light
curtains, as well as other safety and non-safety optoelectronics, control units and related
accessories for industrial applications. We also acquired Incuity, which is a supplier of
Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence (EMI) software, in May 2008. Incuity’s software provides
real-time intelligence for business decision support to improve operations and reduce production
waste by providing valuable management insight into a company’s operations. We acquired Pavilion, a
company that is a recognized leader in advanced process control, production optimization and
environmental compliance solutions for process and hybrid industries, in November 2007.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2. Acquisitions and Divestitures — (Continued)

We recorded intangible assets of $43.1 million and goodwill of $69.3 million resulting from
the final purchase price allocations of the CEDES, Incuity and Pavilion acquisitions. Intangible
assets assigned include $34.0 million to technology (15-year weighted average useful life), $6.6
million to customer relationships (9-year weighted average useful life) and $2.5 million to other
intangible assets (4-year weighted average useful life). We assigned the full amount of goodwill
to our Architecture & Software segment. None of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes.

In fiscal 2007, our Control Products & Solutions segment acquired Industrial Control Services
Group Limited, which does business as ICS Triplex, and ProsCon Holdings Ltd. (ProsCon). The
aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was approximately $268.8 million in cash.

ICS Triplex, headquartered in the United Kingdom and acquired in July 2007, is a leading
global supplier of critical control and safety solutions to process industries. It develops,
delivers and maintains advanced products and solutions for high availability, fault-tolerant
applications in process industry segments worldwide. It serves primarily the oil and gas, chemicals
and power generation industries.

ProsCon is a process solutions systems integrator headquartered in Ireland that we acquired in
February 2007. Its areas of expertise include process technology and control systems and
information technology, and it serves customers primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries.

We recorded intangible assets of $121.7 million resulting from the final purchase price
allocations of the ICS Triplex and ProsCon acquisitions. Intangible assets assigned include $49.5
million to customer relationships (12-year weighted average useful life), $28.3 million to
technology (10-year weighted average useful life), $14.4 million to other intangible assets (7-year
weighted average useful life) and $29.5 million to intangible assets not subject to amortization
(related to the ICS Triplex™ trademark). We recorded a charge of $1.3 million during 2007 for
in-process research and development in cost of sales related to the acquisition of ICS Triplex. We
recognized goodwill of $142.0 million related to these transactions, none of which is expected to
be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the full amount of goodwill to our Control Products &
Solutions segment.

The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations since the dates of acquisition. Pro forma financial information and
allocation of the purchase price is not presented as the individual effects of these acquisitions
are not material to our results of operations and financial position.

Divestitures

On January 31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor
repair services businesses to Baldor. These were the principal businesses of our former Power
Systems operating segment. See Note 13 for more information.

6. Long-term and Short-term Debt — (Continued)

On March 16, 2009, we replaced our former five-year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit
facility with two new unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $535.0 million. The new
facilities have borrowing limits of $267.5 million each. One facility has a three-year term and the
other facility has a 364-day term. Our 364-day credit facility includes a term-out option that
allows us to borrow, on March 15, 2010, up to $267.5 million as a term loan for one year. We have
not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at September 30, 2009 or 2008. Borrowings under
these credit facilities bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the
period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of these credit facilities contain covenants
under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We
were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at September 30, 2009 and 2008.
In addition to our two $267.5 million credit facilities, short-term unsecured credit facilities of
approximately $169.7 million at September 30, 2009 were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries. There
were no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit
facilities. Borrowings under our credit facilities during 2009 and 2008 were not significant.

Our short-term debt obligations primarily relate to commercial paper borrowings. At September
30, 2009 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding
at September 30, 2008 were $100.0 million. The weighted average interest rate and maturity period
of the commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2008 were 2.2 percent and six days,
respectively.

Interest payments were $62.8 million during 2009, $63.4 million during 2008 and $64.3 million
during 2007.

9. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurement

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks.
We enter into these contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with
certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies expected to
occur within the next two years (cash flow hedges). Certain of our locations have assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from
intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We
also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate as hedging
instruments to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and
liabilities.

We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair
value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report in other comprehensive (loss) income the
effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that we designate and
that qualify as cash flow hedges. We reclassify these gains or losses into earnings in the same
periods when the hedged transactions affect earnings. Gains and losses on derivative financial
instruments for which we do not elect hedge accounting are recognized in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations in each period, based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial
instruments.

It is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we
believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. We diversify our forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to
any one of these entities. All forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries. The notional values of our forward exchange contracts outstanding at
September 30, 2009 were $902.4 million, of which $369.0 million were designated as cash flow
hedges. Contracts with the most significant notional values relate to transactions denominated in
the British pound sterling, United States dollar, euro and Canadian dollar.

U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. U.S. GAAP also classifies the
inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:

Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

We value our forward exchange contracts using a market approach. We use an internally
developed valuation model based on inputs including forward and spot prices for currency and
interest rate curves. We did not change our valuation techniques during fiscal 2009.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and their location in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet were (in millions):

Approximately $9.2 million ($5.7 million net of tax) of net unrealized losses on

Common Stock

At September 30, 2009, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of one billion shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and 25 million shares of preferred stock, without par
value. In 2009, we retired 35 million shares of common stock that we held in our treasury. These
shares are now designated as authorized and unissued. At September 30, 2009, 17.5 million shares
of common stock were reserved for various incentive plans.

11. Share-Based Compensation

During 2009, 2008, and 2007 we recognized $27.8 million, $32.5 million and $29.0 million in
share-based compensation expense, respectively. The total income tax benefit related to
share-based compensation was $9.1 million during 2009, $11.0 million during 2008 and $10.2 million
during 2007. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a
straight-line basis over the service period of each award recipient. As of September 30, 2009,
total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $29.4 million,
net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of
approximately 1.6 years.

Our 2008 Long-Term Incentives Plan (2008 Plan) authorizes us to deliver up to 7.2 million
shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, or upon grant or in payment of stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock units and restricted
stock. Our 2003 Directors Stock Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 0.5 million shares
of our common stock upon exercise of stock options or upon grant of shares of our common stock and
restricted stock units. Shares relating to awards under our 2008 Plan or our 2000 Long-Term
Incentives Plan that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the
issuance or delivery of shares will be available for further awards under the 2008 Plan.
Approximately 4.8 million shares under our 2008 Plan and 0.3 million shares under our 2003
Directors Stock Plan remain available for future grant or payment at September 30, 2009. After
September 30, 2009, 0.1 million potential shares to be delivered under performance share awards
were cancelled under the 2000 Plan and are now available for future awards under the 2008 Plan. We
use treasury stock to deliver shares of our common stock under these plans. Our 2008 Plan does not
permit share-based compensation awards to be granted after February 6, 2018.

Stock Options

We have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under
various incentive plans at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates.
The exercise price for stock options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, shares of common
stock or a combination of cash and shares. Stock options expire ten years after the grant date and
vest ratably over three years.

The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $7.75, $17.57 and $20.02, respectively. We estimated the
fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the
following assumptions:

The average risk-free interest rate is based on the five-year U.S. treasury
security rate in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected
annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We
determined expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility of our stock
price over the past five years. We determined the expected term of the stock options using
historical data adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

We grant restricted stock to certain employees and previously granted restricted stock to our
non-employee directors. Beginning in 2008, our non-employee directors may elect to receive a
portion of their compensation in restricted stock units. Restrictions lapse over periods ranging
from one to five years. We value restricted stock and restricted stock units at the closing market
value of our common stock on the date of grant.

12. Retirement Benefits

We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our
employees. The pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly pension payments
to eligible employees after retirement. Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are
based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are
primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to
funding our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required by applicable laws and
governmental regulations. We may, however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the
minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in 2007. Other postretirement benefits
are primarily in the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our United States
employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible employees and dependents
after retirement.

In 2008 we used an actuarial measurement date of June 30 to measure our benefit obligations,
plan assets and to calculate our net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement
benefits. In 2009, we changed our measurement date to September 30 due to a change in U.S. GAAP.
We recorded a reduction in retained earnings of $12.2 million ($7.8 million net of tax) in the
fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change.

As of September 30, 2007, we changed our accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans due to a change in U.S. GAAP. As a result, we recorded a reduction in equity
of $200.2 million, net of a deferred tax benefit of $129.0 million. This reduction in equity was
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

of $3.8 million and pre-tax other postretirement benefit cost of $4.8 million for the year ended
September 30, 2007. Also in 2007, we recognized a pension curtailment loss of $0.4 million, an
other postretirement benefits curtailment gain of $45.1 million and an additional other
postretirement benefits settlement gain of $11.0 million. These items are related to our Dodge
mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses and the sale thereof
and are reflected in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. In connection with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and
motor repair services businesses, we retained the pension liability related to eligible Power
Systems participants in our U.S. Plan and Canada Salary Plan and the other postretirement benefit
liability for eligible U.S. non-union and Canada Salary retirees as of the date of the sale, which
will result in ongoing net periodic benefit cost for us. Pension liabilities for our Canada Hourly
Plan and Mexico Dodge Plan, as well as other postretirement liabilities, including for U.S. union
active and retiree participants, have been transferred with the sale of these businesses.

transition obligation of $0.3 million ($0.2 million net of tax) in pension and other
postretirement net periodic benefit cost, which were included in accumulated other comprehensive
loss at September 30, 2008. In 2010 we expect to recognize prior service credits of $15.2
million ($9.4 million net of tax), net actuarial losses of $50.3 million ($31.9 million net of
tax) and a net transition obligation of $0.4 million ($0.3 million net of tax) in pension and
other postretirement net periodic benefit cost, which are included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss at September 30, 2009.

In 2007 we voluntarily contributed $8.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust.

The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans is $2,610.5 million as of the 2009
measurement date and $2,316.7 million as of the 2008 measurement date.

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the estimated increase in gross medical
claims costs. As a result of the plan amendment adopted effective October 1, 2002, our
effective per person retiree medical cost increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for
the majority of our postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we assume the
gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease to 5.50% in 2017.

Decreasing to 4.50% in 2017.

In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we equally
consider the historical performance and the future expected performance for returns for each asset
category, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolios. This resulted in the
selection of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global
weighted-average asset allocations at September 30, by asset category, are:

The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is
to meet the plan’s benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without
undue risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation
ranges and diversification within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that
are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is
controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of
investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager.

As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, our pension plans do not own our common stock.

In certain countries in which we operate, there are no legal requirements or financial
incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we typically
make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a separate
pension fund.

During 2007, we recorded a change in estimate of a contingent liability related to a divested
business, resulting in income of $9.0 million with no income tax effect. We also recorded a net
charge of $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax) related to resolutions of certain claims and
professional service fees related to discontinued operations matters, offset by a benefit related

14. Restructuring Charges and Special Items

During 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $60.4 million ($41.8 million after tax, or
$0.29 per diluted share) related to actions designed to better align our cost structure with
current economic conditions. The majority of the charges relate to severance benefits recognized
pursuant to our severance policy and local statutory requirements. In the Consolidated Statement
of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2009, we recorded $21.0 million of the restructuring
charges in cost of sales, and we recorded $39.4 million in selling, general and administrative
expenses. We expect total cash expenditures associated with these actions to be approximately
$50.7 million.

During 2008, we recorded special items of $50.7 million ($34.0 million after tax, or $0.23 per
diluted share) related to restructuring actions designed to better align resources with growth
opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions. This
charge was partially offset by the reversal of $4.0 million
($3.6 million after tax, or $0.02 per
diluted share) of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions, as
employee attrition differed from our original estimates. The 2008 restructuring actions include
workforce reductions aimed at streamlining administrative functions, realigning selling resources
to the highest anticipated growth opportunities and consolidating business units. The majority of
the charges relate to severance benefits recognized pursuant to our severance policy and local
statutory requirements. In the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September
30, 2008, we recorded $4.1 million of the special items in cost of sales, while $46.6 million was
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.

During 2007, we recorded special items of $43.5 million ($27.7 million after tax, or $0.17 per
diluted share) related to various restructuring actions designed to execute on our cost
productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy. Actions include workforce
reductions, realignment of administrative functions, and rationalization and consolidation of
global operations. In the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30,
2007, $21.8 million of the special items was recorded in cost of sales, while $21.7 million was
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.

We paid $62.6 million, $16.6 million and $5.3 million related to these charges during the
years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Accruals remaining under these
restructuring actions after currency translation and other items are $60.8 million at September 30,
2009.

2009 and $86.0 million at September 30, 2008.

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes for any portion of $1,369.0 million of undistributed
earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries, since these earnings have been, and under current plans
will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon distribution.

We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize current and long-term deferred tax
assets through the reduction of future taxable income, other than for the deferred tax assets
reflected below. Significant factors we
considered in determining the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include our
historical operating results and expected future earnings.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various
U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have
retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of
businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of
the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the
subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and
interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating
the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may
differ from actual payments or assessments.

We recognized a $6.7 million decrease in shareowners’ equity as of October 1, 2007 related to
a change in accounting for uncertain tax positions. As of October 1, 2007, the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits was $116.5 million ($71.4 million, net of $45.1 million of offsetting tax
benefits). The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would have reduced our effective tax rate
if recognized was $37.6 million. The balance of $33.8 million was attributable to discontinued
operations and would not have impacted the effective tax rate for continuing operations if
recognized.

We believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
could be reduced by up to $27.9 million and the amount of offsetting tax benefits could be reduced
by up to $1.1 million during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax
matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations.

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense.
Accrued interest and penalties were $25.8 million and $1.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $24.0
million and $2.0 million at September 30, 2008, respectively. We recognized $8.0 million of
interest and $0.2 million of penalties during 2009.

We conduct business globally and are routinely audited by the various tax jurisdictions in
which we operate. Our U.S. federal tax returns for 2007 through 2009, Wisconsin tax returns for
2003 through 2009, and tax returns for other major states and countries for 1998 through 2009
remain subject to examinations by taxing authorities.

17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Environmental Matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the
environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have
and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without
material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition.

We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at 14 Superfund sites, excluding
sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has
been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible
costs we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at September 30, 2009 to be $9.5
million, of which $4.3 million has been accrued.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us alleging
violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements, or seeking
remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As of
September 30, 2009, we have estimated the total reasonably possible costs we could incur from these
matters to be $113.2 million. We have recorded environmental accruals for these matters of $30.8
million. In addition to the above matters, we retained ownership of Federal Pacific Electric (FPE),
a former subsidiary of Reliance, following the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric
motors and motor repair services businesses. Certain liabilities of FPE are substantially
indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation. At September 30, 2009, FPE has recorded a liability of $23.1
million and a receivable of $22.0 million for these matters, which liability and receivable are
included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs that
could be incurred by FPE for these matters to be $29.4 million.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities — (Continued)

Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment
and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and
other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We
cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset
retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath
current and previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional asset retirement obligations
using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. At September 30, 2009, we have
recorded liabilities for these asset retirement obligations of $2.9 million in other current
liabilities and $23.9 million in other liabilities. We recorded $5.1 million in other current
liabilities and $22.8 million in other liabilities for these obligations at September 30, 2008.

Lease Commitments

Rental expense was $114.7 million in 2009, $116.3 million in 2008 and $97.7 million in 2007.
Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having noncancelable lease terms in excess
of one year aggregated $319.1 million as of September 30, 2009 and are payable as follows (in

through 2015 at approximately $0.4 million per year. Most leases contain renewal options for
varying periods, and certain leases include options to purchase the leased property.

Other Matters

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted
against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product
liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract
matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits,
claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters
that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
financial condition.

We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal
injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many
years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants,
together with hundreds of other companies. In some cases, the claims involve products from
divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have agreed to
defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our former
Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their
divestiture by us, which occurred on January 31, 2007. We are also responsible for half of the
costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against RIC’s divested measurement and flow
control business. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our
products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe
we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the
encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical
condition on the
part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed
from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities — (Continued)

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over
and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising from our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary.
Following litigation against Nationwide Indemnity Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance
carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to Allen-Bradley, we entered into separate
agreements on April 1, 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for
ongoing and future coverage of Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. In exchange for a lump sum payment,
Kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations
to Allen-Bradley. Nationwide administers the Kemper buy-out funds and has entered into a cost
share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for
Allen-Bradley asbestos claims once the Kemper buy-out funds are depleted. We believe that these
arrangements will continue to provide coverage for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims throughout the
remaining life of the asbestos liability.

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the
ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse
rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject
to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe
these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these
divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us
related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain
liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law.
In some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that
we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.

In connection with the spin-offs of our former automotive component systems business,
semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the
spun-off companies have agreed to indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related
to the respective businesses, including environmental and intellectual property matters.

In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor
repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor for costs and damages related to certain
legal, legacy environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses, including certain damages
pertaining to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, arising before January 31, 2007, for which the
maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale. We estimate the potential
future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate $25.9 million, of which
$11.1 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and $11.3 million has been accrued in
other liabilities at September 30, 2009. We recorded $10.5 million and $12.9 million in other
current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, at September 30, 2008 for these
indemnifications.

In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms
and conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in
other contracts with third parties, such as contracts concerning the development and manufacture of
our products, the divestiture of businesses and the licensing of intellectual property. Due to the
number of agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential
future payments.

18. Business Segment Information

Rockwell Automation is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and
information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses.
We determine our operating segments based on the information used by our chief operating decision
maker, our Chief Executive Officer, to allocate resources and assess performance. Based upon these
criteria, we organized our products and services into two operating segments: Architecture &
Software and Control Products & Solutions.

Architecture & Software

The Architecture & Software segment contains all of the elements of our integrated control and
information architecture capable of controlling the customer’s plant floor and connecting with
their manufacturing enterprise. Architecture & Software has a broad portfolio of products

controllers provide integrated multi-discipline control that is modular and scaleable.

•

Software products that include configuration and visualization software used to operate
and supervise control platforms, advanced process control software and manufacturing
execution software (MES) that addresses information needs between the factory floor and a
customer’s enterprise business system. Examples of MES applications are production
scheduling, asset management, tracking, genealogy and manufacturing business intelligence.

•

Other Architecture & Software products, including rotary and linear motion control
products, sensors and machine safety components.

Control Products & Solutions

The Control Products & Solutions segment combines a comprehensive portfolio of
intelligent motor control and industrial control products with the customer support and application

Among other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based upon segment
operating earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices,
certain nonrecurring corporate initiatives, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses and
incremental acquisition related expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments such as
intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory and purchased research and development
charges. Depending on the product, intersegment sales within a single legal entity are either at
cost or cost plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market price. Sales between
legal entities are at an appropriate transfer price. We allocate costs related to shared segment
operating activities to the segments using a methodology consistent with the expected benefit.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the
“Company”) as of September 30, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareowners’ equity, cash flows, and comprehensive (loss) income for each of the three
years in the period ended September 30, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). We also have audited the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial
statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Rockwell Automation, Inc. as of September 30, 2009
and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 1, 2007, the Company
changed its method of accounting for uncertain income tax positions. As discussed in Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, on September 30, 2007, the Company changed its method of
accounting for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness, as of September
30, 2009, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September 30, 2009.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon that evaluation, management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30,
2009.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009
has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report that is included on the
previous two pages.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As previously disclosed, we are in the process of developing and implementing common global
process standards and an enterprise-wide information technology system. In the fourth quarter of
2009, we deployed new business processes and functionality of the system related to our
engineering, manufacturing, order management and finance functions to certain locations. In doing
so, we modified and enhanced our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as a result of and in connection with the implementation of
the new system and processes. Additional implementations will occur to most locations of our
company over a multi-year period, with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 2010-2013.

There have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended September 30, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
