Item 1.

Business

General

Rockwell
Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a
leading global provider of industrial automation power, control
and information products and services. The Company was
incorporated in Delaware in 1996 and is the successor to the
former Rockwell International Corporation as the result of a
tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996,
pursuant to which the Company divested its former aerospace and
defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company
(Boeing). The predecessor corporation was incorporated in
1928.

On
September 30, 1997, we completed the spinoff of our
automotive component systems business into an independent,
separately traded, publicly held company named Meritor
Automotive, Inc. (Meritor). On July 7,



2000, Meritor and Arvin Industries, Inc. merged to
form ArvinMeritor, Inc. (ArvinMeritor). On
December 31, 1998, we completed the spinoff of our
semiconductor systems business (Semiconductor Systems) into an
independent, separately traded, publicly held company named
Conexant Systems, Inc. (Conexant). On June 29, 2001, we
completed the spinoff of our Rockwell Collins avionics and
communications business into an independent, separately traded,
publicly held company named Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell
Collins). In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact
business. Additional information related to this divestiture is
contained in Note 13 in the Financial Statements.

As
used herein, the terms “we”, “us”,
“our”, the “Company” or “Rockwell
Automation” include subsidiaries and predecessors unless
the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing
businesses unless otherwise indicated.

stated.

Operating Segments

We
have two operating segments: Control Systems and Power Systems.
In 2005, our total sales were $5.0 billion. Financial
information with respect to our operating segments, including
their contributions to sales and operating earnings for each of
the three years in the period ended September 30, 2005, is
contained under the caption

Results of Operations

in

MD&A,

and in Note 18 in the Financial
Statements.

Control Systems

Control
Systems is our largest operating segment with 2005 sales of
$4.1 billion (82 percent of our total sales) and
approximately 17,000 employees at September 30, 2005.
Control Systems supplies industrial automation products,
systems, software and services focused on helping customers
control and improve manufacturing processes. The operating
segment includes two main business groups: the Components and
Packaged Applications Group (CPAG) and the Automation
Control and Information Group (ACIG).

CPAG
supplies industrial components, power control and motor
management products, and packaged and engineered products and
systems. CPAG’s sales account for approximately
40 percent of Control Systems’ sales.

ACIG’s
core products are used primarily to control and monitor
industrial plants and processes and typically consist of a
processor, software and input/output (I/ O) devices. ACIG’s
integrated architecture and Logix controllers perform multiple
types of control applications, including discrete, batch,
continuous process, drive system, motion and machine safety
across various factory floor operations. ACIG’s sales
account for approximately 45 percent of Control
Systems’ sales.

In
addition, Control Systems’ offering also includes services
and solutions, such as multi-vendor customer support, training,
automation systems integration, asset management, and
manufacturing information solutions for discrete and targeted
batch process industries. Control Systems’ service and
solution offerings compete with Emerson Electric Co., General
Electric Company, Invensys, Siemens AG and other system
integrators.



The
following is a summary of the major products and services and
major competitors of Control Systems’ two main business
groups:

Depending
on the product or service involved, Control Systems’
competitors range from large diversified businesses that sell
products outside of industrial automation, to smaller companies
specializing in niche products and services. Factors that
influence Control Systems’ competitive position are its
broad product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology
leadership, knowledge of customer applications, large installed
base, established distribution network, quality of products and
services, price and global presence.

Control
Systems’ products are marketed primarily under the
Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software brand names. Major markets
served include consumer products, transportation, oil and gas,
mining, metals and forest products.

In
North America, Control Systems’ products are sold primarily
through independent distributors that typically do not carry
products that compete with Allen-Bradley products. Large systems
and service offerings are sold principally through a direct
sales force, though opportunities are sometimes sourced through
distributors or system integrators. Product sales outside the
United States occur through a combination of direct sales, sales
through distributors and sales through system integrators.

In
2005, sales in the United States accounted for 56 percent
of Control Systems’ sales. Outside the U.S., Control
Systems’ primary markets were Canada, China, the United
Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Australia and Korea.

Control
Systems is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and has
operations in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin
America.

Power Systems

Power
Systems recorded 2005 sales of $0.9 billion
(18 percent of our total sales) and had approximately 4,000
employees at September 30, 2005. Power Systems consists of
two business groups: Dodge mechanical (Mechanical) and Reliance
electrical (Electrical).

Depending
on the product involved, Power Systems’ competitors range
from large diversified businesses that sell products outside of
industrial automation, to smaller companies specializing in
niche products and services. Factors that influence Power
Systems’ competitive position are product quality,
installed base, price and our established distributor network.
While Power Systems’ competitive position is strong in
North America, it is limited somewhat by its small presence
outside the United States.

Mechanical’s
products are marketed primarily under the Dodge brand name while
Electrical’s products are marketed primarily under the
Reliance Electric brand name. Major markets served include
mining, cement, aggregates, environmental, forest products,
food/beverage, oil and gas, metals and material handling.

Mechanical’s
products are sold primarily through distributors while
Electrical’s products are sold primarily through a direct
sales force.

In
2005, sales in the United States accounted for 87 percent
of Power Systems’ sales. Outside the U.S., Power
Systems’ primary markets were Canada, China and
Mexico.

Power
Systems is headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina and has
operations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Geographic Information

In
2005, sales in the United States accounted for 62 percent
of our total sales. Our principal markets outside the United
States are in Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy,
Mexico, Australia and Korea. See

Risk Factors

below for a
discussion of risks associated with our operations outside of
the United States.

Sales
and property information by major geographic area for each of
the three years in the period ended September 30, 2005 is
contained in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.

Employees

At
September 30, 2005, we had approximately 21,000 employees.
Approximately 14,000 were employed in the United States, and, of
these employees, about 7 percent were represented by
various local or national unions.

Raw Materials and Supplies

We
purchase many items of equipment, components and materials used
in the production of our products from others. The raw materials
essential to the conduct of each of our business segments
generally are available at competitive prices. Although we have
a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors, we depend upon the
ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance
and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See

Risk
Factors

below for a discussion of risks associated with our
reliance on third party suppliers.

Backlog

Our
total order backlog was $772.5 million at
September 30, 2005 and $500.4 million at
September 30, 2004. Backlog is not necessarily indicative
of results of operations for future periods due to the
short-cycle nature of most of our sales activities.

Environmental Protection Requirements

Information
about the effect on the Company and its manufacturing operations
of compliance with environmental protection requirements and
resolution of environmental claims is contained in Note 17
in the Financial Statements. See also Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

We
own or license numerous patents and patent applications related
to our products and operations. Various claims of patent
infringement and requests for patent indemnification have been
made to us. We believe that none of these claims will have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition. See
Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

While in the
aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the
operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or
termination of any one of them would materially affect our
business or financial condition. See

Risk Factors

below
for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual
property.

The
Company’s name and its registered trademark “Rockwell
Automation” is important to each of our business segments.
In addition, we own other important trademarks we use for
certain products and services, such as “Allen-Bradley”
and “A-B” for electronic controls and systems for
industrial automation, “Reliance” and “Reliance
Electric” for electric motors and drives and
“Dodge” for mechanical power transmission
products.



Seasonality

Our
business segments are not subject to significant
seasonality.

Risk Factors

We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from
    international sales and are subject to the risks of doing
    business outside of the United States.

Approximately
38 percent of our revenues in 2005 were outside of the
U.S. Future growth rates and success of our business depend
in large part on continued growth in our
non-U.S. operations. Numerous risks and uncertainties
affect our non-U.S. operations. These risks and
uncertainties include changes in political, economic and social
environments, local labor conditions, changes in laws,
regulations and policies of foreign governments, as well as
U.S. laws affecting activities of U.S. companies
abroad, including tax laws and enforcement of contract and
intellectual property rights. In addition, we are affected by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and
interest rates. Additionally, cash generated in
non-U.S. jurisdictions may be difficult to transfer to the
U.S. in a tax-efficient manner.

An inability to anticipate changes in customer preferences
    could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our
success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer
products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of
our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new
products requires high levels of innovation and the development
process is often lengthy and costly. If we are not able to
anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond
to changes in customer preferences, demand for our products
could decline and our operating results would be adversely
affected.

General economic, business or industry conditions may
    result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability.

Demand
for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global
industrial production. As economic activity slows down,
companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending,
resulting in decreased demand for our products. If this occurs,
our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected.

Information technology infrastructure failures could
    significantly affect our business.

We
depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in
order to achieve our business objectives. If we experience a
problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer
virus, a problem with the functioning of an important IT
application, or an intentional disruption of our IT systems by a
third party, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability
to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely
manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary
course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or
revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to
eliminate these problems and address related security
concerns.

We
are in the process of introducing a global Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) system that will redesign and deploy new
processes, organization structures, and a common information
system over a period of several years. As we implement the ERP
system, the new system may not perform as expected. This could
have an adverse effect on our business.

The global industrial automation power, control and
    information products and services industry is highly
    competitive.

We
face strong competition in all of our market segments. Price
competition in our various industries is intense and pricing
pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. We
expect that the level of competition will remain high in the
future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase
our market share or profitability.



The growth of our Control Systems solutions offerings may
    create additional risks.

Risks
inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming
greater responsibility for project completion and success,
defining and controlling contract scope, efficient execution of
projects, and the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors.
Our inability to control, manage, and mitigate these risks could
adversely affect our results of operations.

Natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international
    conflicts or other disruptions to our operations could harm our
    business.

Natural
disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international
conflicts, and the actions taken by the United States and other
governments in response to such events could cause damage or
disrupt our business operations, our suppliers, or our
customers, and could create political or economic instability,
any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Although it is not possible to predict such events or their
consequences, these events could decrease demand for our
products, could make it difficult or impossible for us to
deliver products, or could disrupt our supply chain.

The inability to secure and maintain rights to
    intellectual property could harm our business and our
    customers.

We
own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and
trade names that are important to our business. The loss of
patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business
may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights
could be significant. In addition, others may assert
intellectual property infringement claims against us or our
customers. We sometimes provide a limited intellectual property
indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to
our customers and in other types of contracts with third
parties. Indemnification payments and legal costs to defend
claims could have an adverse effect on our business.

Future legislation or regulations intended to reform the
    funding and reporting of pension benefit plans could adversely
    affect our operating results and cash flows, as could changes in
    market conditions that impact the assumptions we use to measure
    our liabilities under these plans.

Legislators
and agencies of the U.S. government have proposed
legislation and regulations to amend, restrict or eliminate
various features of, and mandate additional funding of, pension
benefit plans. If legislation or new regulations are adopted, we
may be required to contribute additional cash to these plans, in
excess of our current estimates. Market volatility in interest
rates, investment returns and other factors could also adversely
affect the funded status of our pension plans. Moreover, future
changes to the accounting and reporting standards related to
pension plans could create significant volatility in our
operating results.

The inability to successfully defend claims from taxing
    authorities related to our current and divested businesses could
    adversely affect our operating results and financial
    position.

We
conduct business in many countries, which requires us to
interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those
taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws
between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of
factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities
may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from
taxing authorities related to these differences could have an
adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.
In connection with the divestiture of certain businesses in
prior years, we retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax
refunds for periods before the divestitures. As a result, from
time to time, we may be required to make payments related to tax
matters associated with those divested businesses.

Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel
    could lead to a loss of revenue or profitability.

Our
success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our
senior management team and key employees. Their skills,
experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our
operations and



administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our
senior management team and key employees could have a negative
effect on our operating results.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including
    asbestos claims) could adversely affect our business.

Various
lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted
against us relating to the conduct of our business, including
those pertaining to product liability, safety and health,
employment and contract matters. We have been named as a
defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of
exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our
products many years ago. The uncertainties of litigation
(including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the
collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to accurately
predict the ultimate resolution thereof.

Potential liabilities and costs relating to environmental
    remediation could adversely affect our business.

Our
operations, both in the United States and abroad, are subject to
regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities
concerned with the impact of the environment on human health,
the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the
air, ground and waters, the quality of air and bodies of water,
and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances.
Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may
change. Our financial responsibility for the cleanup or other
remediation of contaminated property or for natural resource
damages can extend to previously owned or used properties,
waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or
individuals, as well as properties currently owned and used by
us, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to
prior owners.

We
have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup
sites and may be in the future as well, and the costs associated
with these current and future sites may be significant.

Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse
    effect on us.

We
have acquired, and anticipate continuing to acquire, businesses
in an effort to enhance shareowner value. Acquisitions involve
risks and uncertainties, including:

Future
acquisitions could cause us to incur additional debt, dilution,
contingent liabilities, increased interest expense, and
amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Impairment
losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite
life, or restructuring charges, could also occur as a result of
acquisitions.

A disruption to our distribution channel could have an
    adverse effect on our operating results.

In
North America, approximately 75 percent of our sales are
through a limited number of third party distributors. While we
maintain the right to appoint new distributors, any unplanned
disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our
revenues and profitability. A disruption could be caused by the
sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of
the distributor, or other unforeseen events.



Our reliance on third party suppliers creates certain
    risks and uncertainties.

Our
manufacturing processes require that we purchase a high volume
of equipment, components and materials from third party
suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves certain
risks, including:

•

the cost of these purchases may change due to inflation,
    exchange rates and other factors;

•

poor quality can adversely affect the reliability and reputation
    of our products; and

•

a shortage of components or materials could adversely affect our
    manufacturing efficiencies and delivery capabilities, which
    could reduce sales and profitability.

Any
of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability
and ability to compete. We also maintain several single-source
supplier relationships, because either alternative sources are
not available or the relationship is advantageous due to
performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price
considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of
single-source components or products could adversely affect our
ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in
a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays
would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and
more profitable products. Even where alternative sources of
supply are available, qualifying the alternative suppliers and
establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result
in delays and a possible loss of revenues.

Item 2.

Properties

At
September 30, 2005, we operated 69 plants, principally in
North America. We also had 278 sales and administrative offices
and a total of 37 warehouses, service centers, and other
facilities. The aggregate floor space of our facilities was
approximately 14.1 million square feet. Of this floor
space, we owned approximately 52 percent and leased
approximately 48 percent. Manufacturing space occupied
approximately 6.6 million square feet. Our Control Systems
segment occupied approximately 3.7 million square feet, and
our Power Systems segment occupied the remaining approximately
2.9 million square feet of manufacturing space. At
September 30, 2005, approximately 0.7 million square
feet of floor space was not in use, principally in owned
facilities.

In
November 2005, we sold and leased back 24 properties in North
America comprising approximately 3.8 million square feet.
See Note 20 in the Financial Statements for additional
information.

There
are no major encumbrances (other than financing arrangements,
which in the aggregate are not significant) on any of our plants
or equipment. In our opinion, our properties have been well
maintained, are in sound operating condition and contain all
equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present
levels.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Rocky
Flats Plant.

On January 30, 1990, a civil action was
brought in the United States District Court for the District of
Colorado against us and another former operator of the Rocky
Flats Plant (the Plant), Golden, Colorado, that we operated from
1975 through December 31, l989 for the Department of Energy
(DOE). The action alleges the improper production, handling and
disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances,
constituting, among other things, violations of various
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and
misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto.
The plaintiffs, who purportedly represent two classes, sought
compensatory damages of $250 million for diminution in
value of real estate and other economic loss; the creation of a
fund of $150 million to finance medical monitoring and
surveillance services; exemplary damages of $300 million;
CERCLA response costs in an undetermined amount; attorneys’
fees; an injunction; and other proper relief. On
February 13, 1991, the court granted certain of the motions
of the defendants to dismiss the case. The plaintiffs
subsequently filed a new complaint, and on November 26,
1991, the court granted in part a renewed motion to dismiss. The
remaining portion of the case is pending before the court. On
October 8, 1993, the court certified separate medical
monitoring and property value classes. Trial began on
October 11, 2005. Effective August 1, 1996, the DOE
assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants,
including us, in the action. Beginning on that date, the costs
of our defense, which had previously been reimbursed to us by
the DOE, have been and are being paid directly by the DOE. We
believe that we are entitled under applicable law and our
contract with the DOE to be indemnified for all costs and any
liability associated with this action.

On
November 13, 1990, we were served with another civil action
brought against us in the same court by James Stone, claiming to
act in the name of the United States, alleging violations of the
U.S. False Claims Act in connection with our operation of
the Plant (and seeking treble damages and forfeitures) as well
as a personal cause of action for alleged wrongful termination
of employment. On August 8, 1991, the court dismissed the
personal cause of action. On December 6, 1995, the DOE
notified us that it would no longer reimburse costs incurred by
us in defense of the action. On November 19, 1996, the
court granted the Department of Justice leave to intervene in
the case on the government’s behalf. On April 1, 1999
a jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $1.4 million in
damages. On May 18, 1999, the court entered judgment
against us for approximately $4.2 million, trebling the
jury’s award as required by the False Claims Act, and
imposing a civil penalty of $15,000. If the judgment is affirmed
on appeal, Mr. Stone will also be entitled to an award of
attorneys’ fees but the court refused to award fees until
appeals from the judgment have been exhausted. On
September 24, 2001, a panel of the 10th Circuit Court
of Appeals affirmed the judgment. On November 2, 2001, we
filed a petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeals seeking
reconsideration of that portion of the decision holding that the
relator, Mr. Stone, is entitled to an award of
attorneys’ fees. On March 4, 2002, the Court of
Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for the limited
purpose of making findings of fact and conclusions of law
pertaining to Mr. Stone’s relator status and, the
trial court having made findings of fact on the issue, on
March 15, 2004, a panel of the Court of Appeals again ruled
that Mr. Stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’
fees. We believe that ruling is in error and have petitioned the
10th Circuit Court of Appeals for en banc review. We
believe that we are entitled under applicable law and our
contract with the DOE to be indemnified for all costs and any
liability associated with this action, and intend to file a
claim with the DOE seeking reimbursement. We believe that an
outcome adverse to us will not have a material effect on our
business or financial condition.

On
January 8, 1991, we filed suit in the United States Claims
Court against the DOE, seeking recovery of $6.5 million of
award fees that we allege are owed to us under the terms of our
contract with the DOE for management and operation of the Plant
during the period October 1, 1988 through
September 30, 1989. On July 17, 1996, the government
filed an amended answer and counterclaim against us alleging
violations of the U.S. False Claims Act previously asserted
in the civil action described in the preceding paragraph. On
May 4, 2005, we filed another claim with the DOE, seeking
recovery of $11.3 million in unreimbursed costs incurred in
defense of the Stone suit described in the preceding paragraph.
On September 30, 2005, the DOE denied that claim, a denial
we intend to appeal, and simultaneously filed a motion in the
Court of Claims suit seeking leave to amend its answer and
counterclaim to seek repayment of $4 million in previously
reimbursed Stone



defense costs or an offset of that amount against any judgment
we might obtain against the DOE on our claim for award
fees.

Russellville.

On March 24, 1997, the Circuit Court of Franklin County,
Kentucky in

Commonwealth of Kentucky, Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Cabinet vs. Rockwell

, an action
filed in 1986 seeking remediation of PCB contamination resulting
from unpermitted discharges of PCBs from a plant in
Russellville, Kentucky owned and operated by our
Measurement & Flow Control Division prior to its
divestiture in March 1989, entered judgment establishing PCB
cleanup levels for the former plant site and certain offsite
property and ordering additional characterization of possible
contamination in the Mud River and its flood plain. The Court
deferred any decision on the imposition of civil penalties
pending implementation of an appropriate remediation program. On
August 13, 1999, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial
court’s judgment, a ruling that the Supreme Court of the
State of Kentucky has let stand. We have been proceeding with
remediation and characterization efforts consistent with the
trial court’s ruling.

Solaia
Technology LLC.

We are a party in several suits in which
Solaia Technology LLC (Solaia) is adverse. Solaia is a
single-purpose entity formed to license US Patent
No. 5,038,318 (the ’318 patent). Solaia acquired the
’318 patent from Schneider Automation, Inc., a competitor
of ours in the field of factory automation. Schneider has
retained certain interests in the ’318 patent, including a
share in Solaia’s licensing income. Solaia has asserted
that the ’318 patent covers computer controlled factory
automation systems used throughout most modern factories in the
United States.

Solaia
has issued hundreds of demand letters to a wide range of factory
owners and operators, and has filed a series of lawsuits against
over 40 companies alleging patent infringement. A
significant number of the companies sued by Solaia have chosen
to settle the claims for amounts that we believe are notably
smaller than the likely legal costs of successfully defending
Solaia’s claims in court. Recently, Solaia has dismissed
its lawsuits against several of the companies that chose not to
settle.

In
a suit filed by Solaia on July 2, 2002 in Chicago,

Solaia Technology LLC v. ArvinMeritor, Inc., et al.

(02-C-4704, N.D. Ill.) (Chicago patent suit), Solaia accused
sixteen companies of infringing the ’318 patent. We
made arrangements with ArvinMeritor, which owns and operates our
former automotive business, to undertake ArvinMeritor’s
defense of Solaia’s patent claims to seek to assure that
Solaia’s infringement claim against ArvinMeritor could be
finally and actually adjudicated in the Chicago patent suit. In
that case, Solaia responded on May 12, 2003 by suing us
directly for direct patent infringement, demanding material
monetary damages. We believe that Solaia’s claim against us
in the Chicago patent suit is wholly without merit and baseless.
On March 28, 2005, the court granted ArvinMeritor’s
motion for summary judgment that the accused ArvinMeritor
systems did not infringe the ’318 patent. On the same date,
the court denied Solaia’s motion for summary judgment that
the accused Rockwell systems infringed the ’318 patent.
Additional summary judgment motions, in which we seek dismissal
of Solaia’s claims against us, remain pending.

We
sought to protect our customers from Solaia’s claims by
bringing an action in federal court in Milwaukee against Solaia,
its law firm Niro, Scavone, Haller & Niro, and
Schneider Automation,

Rockwell Automation, Inc.,
et al. v. Schneider Automation, Inc., et al

(Case No. 02-C-1195 E.D. Wis.) (the Milwaukee action).
Pursuant to our claims of tortious interference, civil
conspiracy and violations of federal antitrust and unfair
competition laws, we are seeking monetary damages and other
relief arising from the infringement claims Solaia has made
against our customers.

In
January 2003, Solaia filed a lawsuit in federal court in Chicago
against us and several others,

Solaia Technology LLC v.
Rockwell Automation, Inc., et al.,

(Case
No. 03-C-566 N.D. Ill.), alleging federal antitrust and
unfair competition violations, tortious interference, defamation
and other claims. We deny any liability under those claims.
Solaia’s antitrust and tort case has now been transferred
to the federal court in Milwaukee (Case No. 03-C-939, E.D.
Wis.) and effectively consolidated with the Milwaukee action,
and all proceedings in Milwaukee have been administratively
stayed.

In
December 2003, Solaia filed a state court action in Cook County,
Illinois alleging tortious interference claims against us and
one of our former officers. This action was removed from state
court and, as with



Solaia’s January 2003 suit, has been transferred to the
federal court in Milwaukee (Case No. 04-C-368, E.D.
Wis.).

All
of the Milwaukee cases are in their earliest stages. The federal
court in Milwaukee has stayed all three cases in Milwaukee
pending developments in the Chicago patent suit.

Asbestos.

Like thousands of other companies, we (including our
subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits
alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos
that was used in certain components of our products many years
ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that
name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other
companies. The great bulk of the complaints, however, do not
identify any of our products or specify which of these
claimants, if any, were exposed to asbestos attributable to our
products; and past experience has shown that the vast majority
of the claimants will never identify any of our products. In
addition, when our products appear to be identified, they are
frequently from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for
most of the costs. For those claimants who do show that they
worked with our products, we nevertheless believe we have
meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity
of our products, the encapsulated nature of any
asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing
medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those
cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the
vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We
have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers
indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured
retentions, for most of these claims. We initiated litigation in
the Milwaukee County Circuit Court on February 12, 2004 to
enforce the insurance policies against Nationwide Indemnity
Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that
provided liability insurance coverage to our former
Allen-Bradley subsidiary. As a result, the insurance carriers
have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed
to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity
costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims, subject to policy
limits. If either carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits
of either carrier are exhausted, our share of future defense and
indemnity costs may increase. However, coverage under excess
policies may be available to pay some or all of these
costs.

The
uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term
solvency of our insurance companies make it difficult to predict
accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That
uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings
or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the
settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on
our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe
these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.

Other.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may
be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of
our business, including those pertaining to product liability,
environmental, safety and health, intellectual property,
employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits,
claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we
believe the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted
will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
financial condition.

Overview

Overall
demand for our products is driven by:

U.S. Industrial Economic Trends

In
2005, sales in the U.S. accounted for more than
60 percent of our total sales. The trend of improving
conditions experienced in the U.S. manufacturing economy
during 2004 continued into 2005, as reflected in the various
indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our
served markets. These indicators include:

•

Industrial equipment spending, which is an
    economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
    (“BEA”). This statistic provides insight into spending
    trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy, which includes
    our primary customer base. This measure, over the longer term,
    has proven to have reasonable predictive value, and to be a good
    directional indicator of our growth trend.

•

Capacity utilization, which is an
    indication of plant operating activity published by the Federal
    Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation
    between capacity utilization and the level of capital investment
    made by our customers in their manufacturing base.

•

The purchasing managers’ index (PMI),
    published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is
    an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the
    U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates
    that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a
    measure below 50 indicates that it is generally
    contracting.



The
table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in
U.S. industrial equipment spending (expressed in billions
of USD), capacity utilization (expressed as a percentage), and
the continued expansion in manufacturing activity, as indicated
by the PMI (expressed as defined above) since December
2002.

Note: Economic indicators are subject to revisions by the
issuing organizations.

Non-U.S. Regional Trends

Outside
the U.S., demand is principally driven by the strength of the
industrial economy in each region and by our customers’
ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets.
These customers may include both multinational companies with
expanding global presence and growing indigenous companies.
Recent strength in demand has, in part, been driven by
investment in infrastructure in developing economies, in basic
materials production capacity in response to higher-end product
pricing and in expanding consumer markets.

table below presents our actual sales for the year ended
September 30, 2005 by geographic region and the change in

Industry Views

We
serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer
products, transportation, basic materials, and oil and gas.
During 2005 we benefited from growing demand in most of the
industries we serve.



Our
consumer products customers are engaged in the food and
beverage, brewing, consumer packaged goods and life sciences
industries. As automation is key to their ability to
differentiate their product offerings, their investment is
generally less cyclical than heavy manufacturing customers.

Factors
such as customer investment in new model introductions and more
flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales to
transportation customers.

Our
customers in basic materials industries, including mining,
aggregates, metals, forest products and cement, all benefit from
higher commodities prices and higher global demand for basic
materials, both of which encourage investment in capacity and
productivity in these industries.

As
energy prices rise, customers in the oil and gas industry
increase their investment in production and transmission
capacity. In addition, higher energy prices have historically
caused customers across all industries to consider new
investment in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and
technologies, such as intelligent motor controls.

Outlook for 2006

The
following is a summary of our objectives for 2006:

Our
outlook for 2006 assumes that the economic environment will
remain favorable and that a continuing industrial recovery will
result in growth during 2006. While we expect demand for our
products to benefit from this trend, we also assume that our
growth will vary, and may exceed or lag trend levels in any
given quarter.

As
of the date of filing this report, based upon current economic
activities and business trends, we expect to grow revenue in
2006 by 7 to 9 percent, excluding the effect of changes in
currency exchange rates. As of the date hereof, we also expect
full year 2006 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of
$3.00 to $3.10, and plan to generate free cash flow of
approximately $280 million, after giving effect to our
$450 million voluntary contribution to our
U.S. qualified pension trust in October 2005.

Sales
increased 13 percent compared to 2004 driven by double
digit growth at both Control Systems and Power Systems. Two
percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes
in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the
strength of the major European currencies and the Canadian
dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Sales rose by double
digit percentages in all regions except for EMEA where difficult
economic conditions dampened growth in the major economies of
Western Europe, primarily France, Germany and the U.K. The
emerging economies in Asia-Pacific, led by China and India,
experienced particularly strong growth. Strength of the oil and
gas and mining industries in Latin America and oil and gas
industry in Canada contributed to particularly strong sales
growth in those regions.

Sales
in the global water/ wastewater, oil and gas, aggregate and
cement, and mining industries grew at a rate higher than our
annual growth rate of 13 percent. Sales in the food and
transportation industries grew at rates approximate to our
annual growth rate, while sales in life sciences, semiconductor,
and beverage grew at a rate less than our annual growth
rate.



Income
from continuing operations benefited from higher volume,
productivity programs and favorable pricing offset slightly by
inflation in comparison to the prior year. Additionally, income
from continuing operations in 2005 includes $19.7 million
($0.10 per share) of tax benefits related to the resolution
of claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure
of the 1998 through 2002 federal audit and $8.4 million
after-tax ($0.04 per share) of benefits related to
insurance settlements, offset by $14.2 million after-tax
($0.08 per share) related to special charges associated
with restructuring activities in Europe and a U.S. plant
closing. Income from continuing operations in 2004 includes
$46.3 million ($0.24 per share) of tax benefits
related to the resolution of certain tax matters and state tax
refunds, offset by $16.3 million after-tax ($0.09 per
share) of special facilities related charges.

Systems sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004.
Three percentage points of the sales increase was due to
the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily
resulting from the relative strength of the major European
currencies and the Canadian dollar in relation to the
U.S. dollar. Sales of our Logix offering grew by more than
26 percent compared to 2004, which was somewhat offset by a
decline in our legacy control platform products that are being
replaced by Logix. Growth in sales of our Logix offering was
driven by our introduction of new functionality and an expanded
addressable market. Our intelligent motor control products also
delivered significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to
extraction-based and heavy industrial customers. Higher
commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency
programs led to the strong demand from these customers.

Segment
operating earnings increased by 43 percent compared to
2004. The increase in segment operating earnings is due to
higher volume, cost productivity and favorable pricing that was
somewhat offset by inflation. Control Systems 2005 results
include $12.3 million (pre-tax) of benefits related to
insurance settlements offset by $16.5 million (pre-tax) of
special charges associated with realignment of administrative
functions and a reduction in workforce in Europe. Prior year
segment operating earnings includes a $26.3 million
(pre-tax) charge related to a facilities rationalization
program.

Power
Systems sales increased 17 percent compared to 2004 with
growth in both our Dodge mechanical and Reliance electrical
business groups. Growth was driven by demand from the
power-centric customers in heavy, extraction-based industries
such as mining and oil and gas. Higher commodity prices are
causing the segment’s predominantly U.S. based
customers to invest in capacity expansion after
several years of under-investment and reduced capital
spending.

Power
Systems operating earnings grew 63 percent due to higher
volume, favorable pricing and productivity somewhat offset by
inflation and significantly higher material costs. Segment
operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of $5.0 million
(pre-tax) associated with a facility closure and the
corresponding write-down of property to its fair value compared
to $4.0 million (pre-tax) of charges related to
restructuring activities in 2004.



General Corporate — Net

General
corporate expenses were $69.7 million in 2005 compared to
$88.3 million in 2004. Expense dropped primarily due to
decreased environmental costs, lower contributions to our
charitable corporation and increased interest income.

Interest Expense

Interest
expense was $45.8 million in 2005 compared to
$41.7 million in 2004, primarily due to higher interest
rates associated with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in
the Financial Statements).

Control
Systems sales increased 11 percent compared to 2003.
Four percentage points of the sales increase was due to the
effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily
resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the
U.S. dollar. Sales outside of the U.S. increased
15 percent (6 percent excluding the effect of changes
in currency exchange rates) and U.S. sales increased
8 percent.

Control
Systems experienced sales growth in all regions with exceptional
strength in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America
where we continued to increase market penetration. Sales growth
was primarily driven by maintenance related and smaller
productivity related projects. These projects were the result of
pent-up demand after the period of under-investment in
productive assets during 2002 and 2003. In addition to these
investments, we experienced an increase in activity related to
larger scale projects in the second half of fiscal year 2004.
These larger projects were driven by our customers’
requirements for incremental productivity improvements and
capacity optimization.

Our
Logix platform business continued its strong growth with an
increase of 30 percent over 2003. Industrial components and
adjustable speed drives experienced double-digit growth as well.
These gains were partially offset by moderate declines in drive
systems and legacy control platforms.

Segment
operating margins increased due to higher volume, favorable
product mix and productivity improvements. Volume leverage
improved during the year due to our continuing productivity
efforts and ongoing facility rationalization programs.

of volume strength in the second half of 2004. Higher global
demand for basic materials and subsequent higher prices for
these materials encouraged significant investment in capacity
optimization and productivity and drove our sales.

Significant
cost and productivity initiatives launched in the second quarter
of 2004, financial leverage on incremental volume and price
increases more than offset rising raw material prices, resulting
in the improved segment operating margin.

General Corporate — Net

General
corporate expenses were $88.3 million in 2004 compared to
$66.8 million in 2003. Expense in 2004 includes charges of
$16.4 million due to higher estimated costs for
environmental remediation at several legacy sites,
$7.0 million of contributions to our charitable corporation
and $5.0 million of costs associated with corporate staff
changes. Expense in 2003 included a charge of $4.7 million
due to higher estimated future costs for environmental
remediation at a legacy site.

Loss on Disposition of a Business

In
the second quarter of 2003, we sold a majority of our ownership
interest in Reliance Electric Limited Japan (REJ) resulting
in a loss of $8.4 million ($2.5 million after tax, or
$0.01 per diluted share). The cash proceeds from the
transaction totaled $10.4 million.

Interest Expense

Interest
expense was $41.7 million in 2004 compared to
$52.5 million in 2003. The decrease was the result of the
retirement at maturity of the $150.0 million principal
amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, the benefit of an
interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements)
and lower average short-term borrowings.

Discontinued Operations

See
Note 13 and Note 16 in the Financial Statements for
information regarding discontinued operations.

Income Taxes

During
2005, we recognized tax benefits of $19.7 million
($0.10 per diluted share) related to the resolution of
claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure of
the federal audit cycle for the years 1998 through 2002.

In
2004, we recognized tax benefits of $46.3 million
($0.24 per diluted share) related to the following
items:

•

$34.5 million resulting from the
    resolution of certain tax matters primarily related to former
    businesses. A majority of the benefits recognized related to
    non-U.S. tax matters in addition to an agreement with a
    taxing authority related to the treatment of an investment;

•

$4.3 million related to additional state tax benefits
    associated with the U.S. research and experimentation
    credit refund claim in 2003 (see discussion
    below); and

•

$7.5 million related to a refund from the State of
    California for the period 1989 to 1991.



During
2003, we recognized a net tax benefit of $69.4 million
($0.37 per diluted share) related to a U.S. federal
research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax
benefit of approximately $2.6 million as a result of our
ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which
a valuation allowance had been previously provided.

The
full year effective tax rate for 2005 was 29.7 percent as
compared to 19.2 percent for 2004. The discrete items
described above decreased the effective tax rate by
2.6 percent in 2005 and 10.5 percent in 2004. The full
year effective tax rate for 2003 was 5.4 percent, including
the effect of the research and experimentation settlement
(23.3 percent benefit) and the utilization of capital loss
carryforwards (0.9 percent benefit).

See
Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a reconciliation of
the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax
rate.

Current
and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions has
resulted, and may continue to result, in an increasing effective
tax rate over time. We expect that the effective income tax rate
in 2006 will be approximately 33.5 percent, excluding the
income tax expense or benefit related to discrete items, if any,
that will be separately reported or reported net of their
related tax effects.

See
Note 13 and Note 16 in the Financial Statements for
information on tax matters related to discontinued
operations.

Financial Condition

The
following is a summary of our cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities, as reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions):

Our
definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial
measure, takes into consideration capital investment required to
maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our
strategy. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful
information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash
from business operations that is available for acquisitions and
other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and
share repurchases. We use free cash flow as one measure to
monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash
flow may be different from definitions used by other
companies.

Free
cash flow was $514.8 million for the year ended
September 30, 2005 compared to $498.9 million for the
year ended September 30, 2004. Increased pre-tax earnings
more than offset the increase in voluntary contributions to our
U.S. pension plan ($150.0 million in 2005 compared to
$125.0 million in 2004), capital spending and working
capital needs. The increased capital spending includes
investments in information technology and certain long-lived
asset replacements.



When
necessary, we utilize commercial paper as our principal source
of short-term financing. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, we
had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During 2005 we
had no commercial paper borrowings and during 2004 we did not
have significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash
position.

In
January 2004, we repaid our $8.4 million of industrial
development revenue bonds prior to maturity using cash on hand.
In April 2003, we repaid our $150.0 million principal
amount of 6.80% notes at maturity using a combination of
cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings.

In
2005, we repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares of
our common stock at a cost of $499.2 million, compared to
repurchases of approximately 7.5 million shares of our
common stock at a cost of $258.4 million in 2004. We
anticipate repurchasing stock in 2006, the amount of which will
depend ultimately on business conditions, stock price and other
cash requirements. At September 30, 2005 we had
authorization from our Board of Directors to purchase up to
approximately 8.8 million additional shares through
September 30, 2006.

In
October 2005, we contributed $450 million to our
U.S. qualified pension trust. The contribution was funded
with a combination of cash on hand and $300 million of
commercial paper borrowings. In November 2005, we sold
24 owned properties in a sale-leaseback transaction for net
cash proceeds of approximately $148 million. The cash
proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings.

We
expect future significant uses of cash to include capital
expenditures, dividends to shareowners, repayments of short-term
borrowings, acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common
stock and may include additional contributions to our pension
plans. We expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be about
$150 million. We expect that each of these future uses of
cash will be funded by existing cash balances, cash generated by
operating activities, commercial paper borrowings, a new issue
of debt or issuance of other securities.

In
addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have
access to existing financing sources, including the public debt
markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our
debt-to-total capital ratio was 31.2 percent at
September 30, 2005 and 28.9 percent at
September 30, 2004.

In
October 2004, we entered into a five-year $600.0 million
unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then
existing $675.0 million unsecured credit facilities.
Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on
short-term money market rates in effect during the period the
borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility
contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our
debt-to-total capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent. In
addition to our $600.0 million credit facility, short-term
unsecured credit facilities of approximately $115 million
at September 30, 2005 were available to foreign
subsidiaries.

The
following is a summary of our credit ratings as of
September 30, 2005:

Moody’s
changed its long-term outlook from negative to stable during the
second quarter of 2005 to reflect our leading position in the
global industrial automation market, our healthy balance sheet
and solid cash flow generation.

Among
other things, we can draw our credit facility as a standby
liquidity facility, to repay our outstanding commercial paper as
it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial
paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set
forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial
paper. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings,
we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit
facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit
available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed,
to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it
matures.



If
our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected
due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would
expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the
unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short-term
funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the
unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the
cost of commercial paper borrowings.

Cash
dividends to shareowners were $142.7 million
($0.78 per share) in 2005 and $122.5 million
($0.66 per share) in 2004. Although declaration and payment
of dividends are at the sole discretion of our Board of
Directors, we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends in
2006 of $0.225 per outstanding share.

At
September 30, 2005, we and Rockwell Collins each guarantee
one-half of a lease agreement for one of Rockwell Scientific
Company LLC’s (RSC) facilities. The total future minimum
payments under the lease are $4.8 million. The lease
agreement has a term that ends in December 2011. In addition, we
share equally with Rockwell Collins in providing a
$6.0 million line of credit to RSC, which bears interest at
the greater of our or Rockwell Collins’ commercial paper
borrowing rate. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, there were
no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit.

Supplemental Sales Information

We
translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United
States using exchange rates effective during the respective
period. Therefore, reported sales are affected by changes in
currency rates, which are outside of our control. We believe
that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange
rates, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful
information to investors because it reflects regional
performance from the activities of our businesses without the
effect of changes in currency rates. We use sales excluding the
effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and
evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of
changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective
period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates as
were in effect in the preceding year. We attribute sales to the
geographic regions based on the country of origin.



The
following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales
excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in
millions):

Systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We
have prepared the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We believe the
following critical accounting policies could have the most
significant effect on our reported results or require subjective
or complex judgments by management.

Retirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Pension
costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are
influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts,
including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan
assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate,
retirement rate, mortality rate and employee turnover rate.
Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of
differences between the assumptions and actual experience will
affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future
periods.

Our
global pension expense in 2005 was $66.2 million compared
to $68.8 million in 2004. Approximately 80 percent of
our 2005 global pension expense relates to our
U.S. qualified pension plan. The
actuarial



assumptions used to determine our 2005 U.S. pension expense
included the following: discount rate of 6.25 percent
(compared to 6.00 percent for 2004); expected rate of
return on plan assets of 8.50 percent (compared to
8.50 percent for 2004); and an assumed compensation
increase rate of 4.50 percent (compared to
4.50 percent for 2004).

In
2005, we made voluntary contributions of $150.0 million to
our primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust compared to
$125.0 million in 2004.

We
estimate our pension expense will be approximately
$82 million in 2006, an increase of approximately
$16 million over 2005. Our estimated 2006 pension expense
reflects the following changes in the U.S. pension
plan:

•

the net cost related to changes in actuarial assumptions;

•

the benefit of a $100 million contribution in September
    2005 and a $450 million contribution in October
    2005; and

•

the benefit related to a plan amendment that eliminates the
    early retirement subsidy for certain employees.

For
2006, changes in actuarial assumptions include a 100 basis
point reduction in our discount rate to 5.25 percent from
the 6.25 percent used in 2005. The discount rate is set as
of our June 30th measurement date and was determined by
modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow
of our benefit plans. Our assumed rate of return on plan assets
will remain at 8.50 percent, consistent with 2005. We
considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as
well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in
setting this assumption. We have assumed a compensation increase
rate of 4.06 percent in 2006, compared to 4.50 percent
used in 2005. We established this rate using an analysis of all
elements of employee compensation that are considered pension
eligible earnings. Additionally, in establishing our 2006
pension assumptions, we performed an actuarial experience study
that changed other assumptions including retirement rate,
employee turnover rate, and mortality rate as a result of
utilizing the RP2000 table projected forward 10 years.

Effective
for 2006, we amended our U.S. pension plan to eliminate the
early retirement subsidy for certain employees. The effect of
the amendment is a reduction of approximately $70 million
in our pension benefit obligation and a corresponding reduction
in annual pension expense recognized over the average remaining
service life of plan participants.

The
following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit
obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of
25 basis points in the assumptions for our
U.S. pension plans (in millions):

Additional
information regarding pension benefits, including our pension
obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment, is
contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements.

Other Postretirement Benefits

We
estimate, with the assistance of third party actuarial
consultants, the costs and obligations for postretirement
benefits other than pensions using assumptions, including the
discount rate and, for plans other than our primary
U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program, expected
trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these
assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual
experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit
expense recognized in future periods. The discount rate used to
calculate our 2005 other postretirement benefits expense was
6.25 percent (compared to 6.00 percent in



2004). For 2006, the discount rate assumption for other
postretirement benefit expense will decrease to
5.0 percent.

Effective
October 1, 2002, we amended our primary
U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to
mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement
healthcare services. As a result of this amendment to our
primary U.S. program, there is no increase in healthcare
costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of
January 1, 2005.

Net
periodic benefit cost in 2005 was $24.9 million compared to
$23.4 million in 2004.

We
expect net periodic benefit cost in 2006 of approximately
$36 million and the estimated postretirement projected
benefit obligation to approximate $425 million. The
expected increases are primarily due to the decrease in discount
rate (as of our June 30, 2005 measurement date) by
125 basis points to 5.0 percent.

Additional
information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in
Note 12 in the Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We
record sales of products and services, representing
approximately 90% of our consolidated sales, when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is
fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and
product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may
be required according to contract terms, or services have been
rendered.

We
recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales on
construction-type contracts using either the
percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of
accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using
the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress towards completion is reasonably and reliably
estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others.
Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales
and gross profit as work is performed using either (i) the
relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated
costs at completion or (ii) units-of-delivery. Under the
percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross
profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or
revenue in the period the change is identified. We record
estimated losses on contracts when they are identified.

We
use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the
existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and
customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the
payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the
sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as
determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the
customer’s payment history.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our
primary incentive program provides distributors with cash
rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary
depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing
(OEM) customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the
product. We also offer various other incentive programs that
provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash
rebates, account credits or additional products and services
based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain
distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to
contractual limitations.

We
record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at
the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical
experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual
returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical
experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to
estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating
the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the
time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate
is processed. If the time period were to change by
10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the
accrual of approximately $5.0 million.



Returns,
rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if
distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and
incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional
products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a
current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of
set-off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The
accrual for customer returns, rebates and incentives was
$117.6 million at September 30, 2005 and
$86.1 million at September 30, 2004, of which
$9.4 million at September 30, 2005 and
$7.8 million at September 30, 2004 was included as an
offset to accounts receivable.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We
evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable
through future cash flows. We evaluate the recoverability of
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate that an asset might be impaired. We use judgment when
applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment
test is necessary. Factors we consider that could trigger an
impairment review include significant underperformance relative
to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant
decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change
in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and
significant negative industry or economic trends.

Impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of
an asset exceeds its estimated fair value. To determine fair
value, we must make estimates of the future cash flows related
to the asset being reviewed. These estimates require assumptions
about demand for our products and services, future market
conditions and technological developments. Other assumptions
include the discount rate and future growth rates.

We
perform our annual impairment test on non-amortized intangible
assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year. As of the
second quarter of 2005, the estimated fair value of our Reliance
trademark exceeded its $72.8 million net book value. We
calculated the estimated fair value with the assistance of third
party valuation specialists. Either an increase in the discount
rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of
our Electrical (Reliance) business group could result in an
impairment charge to write down the book value of the Reliance
trademark to the revised estimated fair value.

Litigation, Claims and Contingencies

We
record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when
an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably
estimate the value of an obligation. We also record liabilities
for environmental matters based on estimates for known
environmental remediation exposures utilizing information
received from independent environmental consultants. The
liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and
third-party sites where we were determined to be a potentially
responsible party. At third-party sites where more than one
potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a
liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to
our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or
unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the
only responsible party, we record a liability for the total
estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future
expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their
present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected
by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental
exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that
remediation procedures change, additional contamination is
identified, or the financial condition of other potentially
responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our
environmental liabilities may change.

The
reserve for environmental matters, net of related receivables,
was $39.3 million at September 30, 2005 and
$38.8 million at September 30, 2004. During 2005, we
recorded adjustments totaling $8.5 million to increase the
environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared
to 2004 adjustments of $16.9 million.

Our
recorded liability for environmental matters almost entirely
relates to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses)
for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. The
nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of
new environmental exposures that could result in a significant
charge to



earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at legacy
sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that
gradually, over a long period of time, our environmental
obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation
procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of
contamination at additional sites could result in increases to
our environmental obligations.

Various
lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted
or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business,
including those pertaining to product liability. As described in
Item 3.

Legal Proceedings,

we have been named
as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result
of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of
our products many years ago. See Item 3 for further
discussion.

Our
principal self-insurance programs include product liability
where we are self-insured up to a specified dollar amount.
Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered
by policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the
reserve for product liability claims, excluding asbestos, with
the assistance of a third party actuarial consultant using our
claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to
the product liability reserves may be required to reflect
emerging claims experience and other factors such as
inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. The reserve for
product liability claims was $29.5 million at
September 30, 2005 and $32.3 million at
September 30, 2004.

Additional
information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is
contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

We
operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to
regular examinations by various U.S. Federal, state and
foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we
have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in
connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior
years. Our income tax positions are based on research and
interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of
the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the
subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each
jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between
those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in
estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters,
our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual
payments or assessments.

While
we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns,
taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of
laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional
transactions. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our
subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products,
services, and/or intellectual property as well as various
U.S. state tax matters comprise our more significant income
tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with regard to
tax exposures and record liabilities for these uncertain tax
positions and related interest and penalties, if any, according
to the principles of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
Contingencies.

We have recorded an accrual of
$103.1 million at September 30, 2005 that reflects our
estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits and
is recorded in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet. A final determination of these tax audits or changes in
our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense
or benefit.

We
have recorded a valuation allowance of $55.5 million at
September 30, 2005 for the majority of our deferred tax
assets related to net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss
carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards (Carryforwards)
based on the projected profitability of the entity in the
respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance is based on
an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the
Carryforwards that are expected to be realized. Our income would
increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more
Carryforwards than currently expected.

At
the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate the
effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year.
The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected
jurisdiction where income is earned as well as tax planning
strategies. Current and projected growth in income in higher tax
jurisdictions has resulted, and may continue to result, in an
increasing effective tax rate over time. If the actual results
differ from our estimates, we may have to adjust the effective
tax rate in the interim period such determination is made.



Additional
information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16
in the Financial Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

We
are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business
from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination
of normal operating and financing activities and derivative
financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap
contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

In
addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal
operating activities, we use a combination of short-term and
long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest
rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.

Our
short-term debt obligations relate to commercial paper
borrowings and bank borrowings. At September 30, 2005 and
2004, we had no commercial paper or bank borrowings outstanding.
During 2005, we had no commercial paper borrowings. In 2004, the
weighted average commercial paper borrowing was
$1.8 million. Changes in market interest rates on
commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. If
market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher
than actual levels in either 2005 or 2004, the effect on our
results of operations would not have been significant.

In
October 2005, we issued $300 million of unsecured
commercial paper obligations with maturities of 1 to
28 days. We used the proceeds of the commercial paper to
partially fund a $450 million voluntary contribution to our
U.S. qualified pension plan trust made on October 11,
2005. As these obligations mature, we anticipate issuing
additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance
all or part of these borrowings.

We
had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with
carrying values of $748.2 million at September 30,
2005 and $757.7 million at September 30, 2004. The
fair value of this debt was $826.2 million at
September 30, 2005 and $837.1 million at
September 30, 2004. The potential reduction in fair value
on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical
10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be
material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently
have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate
instruments and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest
rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or
shareowners’ equity.

In
September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract
that effectively converted our $350.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to
floating rate debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate
was 6.23 percent at September 30, 2005. A hypothetical
10 percent change in market interest rates would not be
significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results
of operations.

Foreign Currency Risk

We
are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal
business operations. These risks include the translation of
local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany
loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in
foreign currencies. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to
these risks through a combination of normal operating activities
and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our
exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than
the applicable functional currency. In addition, we enter into
contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions
expected to occur within the next four years. Contracts are
executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in
currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We do
not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of
foreign subsidiaries from local currency to United States
dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the underlying
foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our
financial condition or results of operations.



We
record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value
regardless of the purpose for holding them. Derivatives that are
not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to
fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are
either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets,
liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized
in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of
a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings
immediately.

At
September 30, 2005 and 2004, we had outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of
contracts to exchange the euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar,
British pound sterling, and Australian dollar for
U.S. dollars. The use of these contracts allows us to
manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as
the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward
exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or
gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. A
hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying
foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts
would not be significant to our financial condition or results
of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Rockwell
Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a
leading global provider of industrial automation power, control
and information products and services.

Basis of Presentation

Except
as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial
statements or the notes thereto relate to our continuing
operations. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

In
September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business.
FirstPoint Contact is classified as a discontinued operation in
the consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented.

Principles of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and controlled
majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in affiliates over which we have the ability to
exert significant influence, but that we do not control and are
not the primary beneficiary of, including Rockwell Scientific
Company LLC (RSC), are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Accordingly, our proportional share of the
respective affiliate’s earnings or losses is included in
other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have
the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for
using the cost method of accounting. These affiliated companies
are not material individually or in the aggregate to our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in
accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and
incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete
inventory; impairment of long-lived assets; product warranty
obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and
contingencies, including environmental matters; and income
taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions
prospectively when warranted by factually based experience.

Revenue Recognition

We
record sales of products and services, representing
approximately 90 percent of our consolidated sales, when
all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists;
pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably
assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has
occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or
services have been rendered.

We
recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales on
construction-type contracts using either the
percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of
accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using
the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress towards completion is reasonably and reliably
estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others.
Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales
and gross profit as work is performed using either (i) the
relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated
costs at completion or (ii) units-of-delivery. Under the
percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross
profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or
revenue in the period the change is identified. We record
estimated losses on contracts when they are identified.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —(Continued)

1.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies —
    (Continued)

We
use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the
existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and
customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the
payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the
sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as
determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the
customer’s payment history.

Shipping
and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and
the related costs are included in cost of sales in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our
primary incentive program provides distributors with cash
rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary
depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the
product. We also offer various other incentive programs that
provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash
rebates, account credits or additional products and services
based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain
distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to
contractual limitations.

We
record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at
the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical
experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a
reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account
credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales
for additional products and services to be provided. Amounts are
accrued at the time of recognition of our sale to a distributor
or direct sale customer. Accruals are reported as a current
liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of set-off
exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of
deposit with original maturities of three months or less.

Receivables

We
record allowances for doubtful accounts based on
customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current
assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
Receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts
of $18.4 million at September 30, 2005 and
$25.2 million at September 30, 2004. In addition,
receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain customer
returns, rebates and incentives of $9.4 million at
September 30, 2005 and $7.8 million at
September 30, 2004.

Inventories

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. Market is determined on the basis
of estimated realizable values.

Property

Property
is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using
the straight-line method over 15 to 40 years for buildings
and improvements, 3 to 14 years for machinery and equipment
and 3 to 10 years for computer hardware and software. We
capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off
replaced units. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as
renewals of minor amounts.

STATEMENTS —(Continued)

Intangible Assets

Goodwill
and other intangible assets generally result from business
acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating
the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at their fair values, the excess of the
purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as
goodwill.

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, requires goodwill
and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to be
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate an impairment may be present, rather than
amortized as previous standards required. Any excess in carrying
value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of
operations.

We
amortize distributor networks, computer software products,
patents and other intangible assets with finite useful lives on
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
generally ranging from 3 to 40 years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We
evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying
amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure
the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the
recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report
assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or
fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a
discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation
techniques.

During
2004, we sold a facility in a sale-leaseback transaction with a
third party resulting in a $20.6 million pre-tax loss. The
net cash proceeds from the sale were $19.0 million.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We
use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap
contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We
use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset
changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with
intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next four
years (cash flow hedges) and changes in the fair value of
certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans
and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign
currencies. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to
manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt. Our
accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based
upon the designation of such instruments as hedges under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
It is our policy to execute such instruments with creditworthy
banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange
contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial
countries.

Foreign Currency Translation

We
translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating
outside of the United States with a functional currency other
than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates at the end of the respective period. We translate sales,
costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during
the respective period. We report foreign currency translation
adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income.
Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
results of operations in the period incurred.

Research and Development Expenses

We
expense research and development (R&D) costs as incurred;
these costs were $138.6 million in 2005,
$121.7 million in 2004 and $121.6 million in 2003. We
include R&D expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We
record a liability for income tax exposures when they are
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Tax
benefits related to claims are also recognized when they become
probable and reasonably estimable. The determination of
probability and the estimate of the liability or tax benefit
reflect the relevant tax law as applied to us taking into
account the particular country, state, or other taxing
authority.

Earnings Per Share

We
present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number
of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
year. The effect of stock options represents the entire
difference between basic and diluted EPS. We use the treasury
stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding stock
options. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the
average market price (out-of-the-money options) over the period
have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude
them from the calculation. Antidilutive options for the years
ended September 30, 2005 (20,013 shares), 2004
(51,938 shares) and 2003 (1,073,119 shares) were
excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

Stock-Based Compensation

We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

. We grant stock options at
prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the
grant dates; therefore we do not recognize compensation expense
in connection with stock options granted to employees. We
recognize compensation expense on grants of restricted stock
during the period of the employee’s service.

STATEMENTS —(Continued)

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the fair value-based method provided by
SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, had been applied for all outstanding and
unvested awards in each year (in millions, except per share
amounts):

Pro
forma net income for 2005 includes an additional
$4.9 million after tax of compensation expense, recognized
in the second quarter of 2005, for retirement eligible stock
option participants. Previously we reported compensation expense
for these participants over the vesting period. Stock options
granted to retirement eligible plan participants who retire
under our retirement plans on or after the first anniversary of
the grant date continue to vest post-retirement in accordance
with plan provisions and agreements related thereto. If the plan
participant retires less than twelve months from the grant date,
the options under that grant are forfeited. Stock compensation
expense on grants to plan participants who are retirement
eligible on the grant date or who will be retirement eligible in
less than twelve months from the grant date is reported in pro
forma net income over the twelve month period from the grant
date. We report stock compensation expense on grants to plan
participants who become retirement eligible between twelve and
thirty-six months after the grant date in pro forma net income
over the period from grant date to the retirement eligibility
date.

Pro
forma net income for 2004 includes $3.6 million after tax
of expense related to performance-vesting options that vested in
the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the market price of our
common stock reaching a specified level for a pre-determined
period of time.

Net
income, as reported and pro forma net income in 2004 include
$2.9 million (before and after tax) of compensation expense
resulting from modifications made to certain stock options in
connection with the sale of our FirstPoint Contact
business.

See
Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further discussion of
stock-based compensation.

The
per share weighted average fair value of options granted was
$12.60 in 2005, $7.20 in 2004 and $2.98 in 2003.

Product and Workers’ Compensation Liabilities

We
record accruals for product and workers’ compensation
claims in the period in which they are probable and reasonably
estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product
liability and workers’ compensation where we self-insure up
to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to
specified limits are covered by policies purchased from
commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority
of the self-insured claims with the assistance of a third party
actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods
being valued.

Environmental Matters

We
record accruals for environmental matters in the period in which
our responsibility is probable and the cost can be reasonably
estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods in
which the estimated costs of remediation change. At
environmental sites for which more than one potentially
responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for
our estimated allocable share of costs related to our
involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or
unidentified parties. At environmental sites for which we are
the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total
estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount to their
present value future expenditures for environmental remediation
obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or
other third parties is probable, we record a receivable for the
estimated recovery.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47) to clarify the guidance included in
SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.

FIN 47 requires companies to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform
asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future
event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. If amounts
cannot be reasonably estimated, certain disclosures will be
required about the unrecognized asset retirement obligations.
The interpretation must be adopted in the fourth quarter of
2006. We are currently evaluating the interpretation to
determine the effect on our financial statements and related
disclosures.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued the revised
SFAS No. 123,

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) requires compensation
cost related to share-based payment transactions, including
stock options and restricted stock, to be recognized in the
financial statements. Compensation cost will be measured based
on the grant-date fair value of the instruments issued using an
option pricing model and will be recognized over the requisite
service period. We are required to implement SFAS 123(R)
for our 2006 fiscal year. SFAS 123(R) will apply to all
awards granted after the implementation date and to
previously-granted awards unvested as of the implementation
date. The effect of adoption of SFAS 123(R) is currently
estimated to be approximately $17 to $20 million ($0.09 to
$0.11 per share) after-tax for 2006. However, our actual
share-based compensation expense in 2006 depends on a number of
factors, including fair value of awards at the time of
grant.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs

(SFAS 151). SFAS 151 requires
that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current-period
charges. Further, SFAS 151 requires the allocation of fixed
production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. Unallocated overhead must be
recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
beginning in the first quarter of 2006. We do not believe the
adoption of SFAS 151 will have a material effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures.

Acquisitions of Businesses

2005 Acquisitions

On
September 1, 2005, our Power Systems segment acquired the
assets of Quality Rewind & Electric, Inc.’s motor
repair and management business based in Ft. McMurray,
Alberta, Canada.

2003 Acquisitions

In
March 2003, our Control Systems segment acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of Weidmüller Holding
AG’s (Weidmüller) North American business. In February
2003, our Control Systems segment acquired substantially all of
the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Interwave
Technology, Inc., a consulting integrator focusing on
manufacturing solutions. The aggregate cash purchase price of
these businesses was $25.7 million. Amounts recorded for
liabilities assumed were approximately $1.0 million.

The
results of operations of these businesses have been included in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations since their respective
dates of acquisition. Pro forma financial information and
allocation of the purchase price for these acquisitions is not
presented as the combined effect of these acquisitions was not

In
September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract
(the Swap) that effectively converted our $350.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008,
to floating rate debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating
rate was 6.23 percent at September 30, 2005 and
4.27 percent at September 30, 2004. As permitted by
SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133), as amended, we have
designated the Swap as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair
value of the Swap was recorded in other
(liabilities) assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with
a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the
underlying debt at September 30, 2005 and 2004. The fair
value of the Swap, based upon quoted market prices for contracts
with similar maturities, was $(6.3) million at
September 30, 2005 and $3.7 million at
September 30, 2004.

On
October 26, 2004, we entered into a five-year
$600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on
short-term money market rates in effect during the period the
borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility
contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our
debt-to-total capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent. In
addition to our $600.0 million credit facility, short-term
unsecured credit facilities of approximately $115 million
at September 30, 2005 were available to foreign
subsidiaries. There were no significant commitment fees or
compensating balance requirements under any of our credit
facilities. Borrowings under our credit facilities during 2005
were not significant.

Interest
payments were $45.6 million during 2005, $40.9 million
during 2004 and $54.7 million during 2003.

Most of our products are covered under a warranty period that
runs for twelve months from either the date of sale or from
installation to an end-user or OEM customer. We also record a

foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to
forecasted intercompany transactions as cash flow hedges. The
amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness
of cash flow hedges was not significant.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights

Each
outstanding share of common stock provides the holder with one
Preferred Share Purchase Right (Right). The Rights will become
exercisable only if a person or group, without the approval of
the board of directors, acquires, or offers to acquire,
20 percent or more of the common stock, although the board
of directors is authorized to reduce the 20 percent
threshold for triggering the Rights to not less than
10 percent. Upon exercise, each Right entitles the holder
to 1/100th of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock of the Company (Junior Preferred Stock) at a
price of $250, subject to adjustment.

Upon
an acquisition of the Company, each Right (other than Rights
held by the acquirer) will generally be exercisable for $500
worth of either common stock of the Company or common stock of
the acquirer for $250. In certain circumstances, each Right may
be exchanged by the Company for one share of common stock or
1/100th of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. The Rights
will expire on December 6, 2006, unless earlier exchanged
or redeemed at $0.01 per Right.

Stock Options

We
have granted options to purchase our common stock under various
incentive plans and by board action to directors, officers and
other key employees at prices equal to the fair market value of
the stock on the grant dates. The plans provide that the option
price for certain options granted under the plans may be paid in
cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof.

Under
our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, we are authorized to grant
up to 24.0 million shares of our common stock as
non-qualified options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were
approximately 8.0 million at September 30, 2005. None
of our employee incentive plans presently permits options to be
granted after November 30, 2009. Stock options generally
expire ten years from the grant date and vest over three

Retirement Benefits

We
sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension
plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly
pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of
credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for
hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit
amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to funding
our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required
by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We may,
however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the
minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in
2005 and 2004. Other postretirement benefits are primarily in
the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our
United States employees and provide for the payment of certain
medical costs of eligible employees and dependents after
retirement.

The
components of net periodic benefit cost are (in millions):

Included
in this net periodic benefit cost table and Income from
discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations is pre-tax pension benefit cost of $2.8 million
and $1.8 million for the years ended September 30,
2004 and 2003, respectively, and pre-tax other postretirement
benefit cost of $1.1 million and $0.2 million for the
years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
related to FirstPoint Contact. We retained the pension liability
related to the eligible FirstPoint Contact participants and the
other postretirement benefit liability for eligible retirees
through the date of sale, which will result in ongoing net
periodic benefit cost for us. Also in 2004, we recognized a
pension curtailment loss of $0.4 million and an other
postretirement benefits curtailment gain of $2.3 million
related to the sale of our FirstPoint

information is summarized as follows (in millions):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Retirement Benefits — (Continued)

During
2005, we recorded an increase to our minimum pension liability
of $468.8 million resulting primarily from the discount
rate change. Considering the increase of the deferred tax asset
of $185.0 million resulting from the increase of our
minimum pension liability and the decrease in the intangible
pension asset of $9.6 million, the net decrease to
shareowners’ equity (reflected as an increase in
accumulated other comprehensive loss) was
$293.4 million.

Effective
for 2006, we amended our U.S. pension plan to eliminate the
early retirement subsidy for certain employees. The effect of
the amendment is a reduction in the pension obligation of
approximately $70 million and a corresponding reduction in
annual pension expense recognized over the average remaining
service life of plan participants.

In
2005, we made voluntary contributions of $150.0 million to
our U.S. qualified pension plan trust, including
$100.0 million contributed in the fourth quarter. We also
made contributions of $17.5 million to our
non-U.S. pension plan trusts in the fourth quarter of 2005.
In 2004, we contributed $125.0 million to our
U.S. qualified pension plan trust.

The
accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans is
$2,357.1 million as of the 2005 measurement date and
$1,768.1 million as of the 2004 measurement date.

We
use an actuarial measurement date of June 30 to measure our
benefit obligations and to calculate our net periodic benefit
cost for pension and other postretirement benefits.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost Assumptions

Significant
assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit cost for
the period ended September 30 are (in weighted
averages):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —(Continued)

12.

Retirement Benefits — (Continued)

Net Benefit Obligation Assumptions

Significant
assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations are (in
weighted averages):

(1)

As a result of a plan amendment adopted
    effective October 1, 2002, and in accordance with
    SFAS No. 106,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,

our
    postretirement healthcare liabilities were recalculated as of
    the date of the amendment using a 6.5 percent discount
    rate, the discount rate applicable at the date of the plan
    amendment. The related net periodic benefit cost in 2003 of
    $29.1 million consists of expense using a 7.0 percent
    discount rate for the period July 1, 2002 through
    September 30, 2002 and expense using a 6.5 percent
    discount rate for the period October 1, 2002 through
    June 30, 2003.

(2)

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the
    estimated increase in gross medical claims costs as required to
    be disclosed by SFAS No. 132,

Employers’
    Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
    Benefits.

As a result of the plan amendment adopted
    effective October 1, 2002, our effective per person retiree
    medical cost increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for the
    majority of our postretirement benefit plans. For our other
    plans, we assume gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease
    to 5.5% in 2011.

(3)

Decreasing to 4.25% in 2011.

Effective
October 1, 2002, we amended our United States
postretirement healthcare benefit program in to order mitigate
the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services.
Effective January 1, 2004, we began contributing
50 percent of the amount in excess of the 2003 per
capita amount. However, our calendar 2004 contribution was
limited to a 7.5 percent increase from the 2003 per
capita amount. Effective January 1, 2005, we limit our
future per capita maximum contribution to our calendar
2004 per capita contribution.

As
a result of the finalization during 2005 of the rules for the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 (the Act), we have included an additional reduction in our
accumulated projected benefit obligation of $13.5 million
as of September 30, 2005 related to certain Other
Postretirement Benefit plans. A reduction in our accumulated
projected benefit obligation of $16.9 million was included
as of September 30, 2004. Net periodic postretirement
benefit cost in 2005 decreased by $2.0 million and is
expected to decrease in 2006 by an additional $1 million as
a result of the Act. There was no adjustment to net periodic
postretirement benefit cost in 2004.

In
determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption, we equally consider the historical performance and
the future expected performance for returns for each asset
category, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension
portfolios. We consulted with and considered the opinions of
financial and other professionals in developing appropriate
return assumptions. This resulted in the selection of the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —(Continued)

12.    Retirement
Benefits — (Continued)

weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
Our weighted-average asset allocations at September 30, by
asset category, are:

The
investment objective for pension funds related to our defined
benefit plans is to meet the plan’s benefit obligations,
while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue
risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan
assets within target allocation ranges and diversification
within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines
that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by
plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing
to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring
of investment manager performance relative to the investment
guidelines established for each manager.

As
of September 30, 2005 and 2004, our pension plans do not
own our common stock.

In
certain non-U.S. countries in which we operate, there are
no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to
companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances,
we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they
become due, rather than by creating a separate pension
fund.

Estimated Future Payments

We
contributed $450 million to our U.S. pension plan
trust in October 2005. In addition, we expect to contribute
approximately $25 million related to our worldwide pension
plans and $30.2 million to our postretirement benefit plans
in 2006.

FirstPoint Contact

In
2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business for cash proceeds
and a note convertible into a minority interest in the corporate
parent of the buyer. The value assigned to the convertible note
on the date of the transaction was approximately
$27.0 million. In September 2005, the note was converted to
non-voting equity shares, accounted for under the cost method.
The historical cost value of $27.0 million was used to
value the equity shares at the date of conversion. No fair value
was available for this investment as the equity shares are not
publicly traded. Accordingly, it is not practicable to estimate
that value. The results of operations of FirstPoint Contact for
2003 and 2004, as well as the gain on the sale, are reflected in

Related Party Transactions

We
own 50 percent of RSC. This ownership interest is accounted
for using the equity method. Our investment in RSC of
$58.8 million at September 30, 2005 and
$57.5 million at September 30, 2004 is included in
Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We
have an agreement with RSC pursuant to which RSC performs
research and development services for us. We incurred
$2.8 million in 2005, $3.7 million in 2004 and
$3.0 million in 2003 for research and development services
performed by RSC. At September 30, 2005, the amounts due to
or from RSC were not significant. At September 30, 2004,
the amount due to RSC for research and development services was
$0.7 million. At September 30, 2004, the amount due
from RSC for cost sharing arrangements was not significant.

We
share equally with Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell Collins),
which owns 50 percent of RSC, in providing a
$6.0 million line of credit to RSC which bears interest at
the greater of our or Rockwell Collins’ commercial paper
borrowing rate. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, there were
no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit. In addition, we
and Rockwell Collins each guarantee one-half of a lease
agreement for one of RSC’s facilities. The total future
minimum lease payments under the lease are $4.8 million.
The lease agreement has a term that ends in December 2011.

We
own 25 percent of CoLinx, LLC (CoLinx), a company that
provides logistics and e-commerce services. This ownership
interest is accounted for using the equity method. We paid
CoLinx $18.2 million in 2005, $17.1 million in 2004
and $15.2 million in 2003, primarily for logistics
services. In addition, CoLinx paid us approximately
$2.8 million in 2005, $2.2 million in 2004 and
$2.4 million in 2003 for the use of facilities we own and
other services. The amounts due to and from CoLinx at
September 30, 2005 and 2004 were not significant.

Income Taxes

The
components of the income tax provision are as follows (in
millions):

During
2005, we recognized a net tax benefit of $19.7 million in
income from continuing operations and $21.6 million in
income from discontinued operations related to current and
former businesses. The net tax benefits included in income from
continuing operations are primarily related to the resolution of
claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure of
the federal audit cycle for the years 1998 through 2002. In
addition, these net tax benefits include the effect of the
true-up of estimated tax audit contingency accruals in
connection with closure of the 1998 through 2002 audit. The net
tax benefits included in discontinued operations relate
primarily to the closure of the 1998 through 2002 audit
($7.5 million), a prior year state tax refund of a divested
business ($11.3 million) and the resolution of various
other tax matters of divested businesses
($2.8 million).

During
2004, we recognized tax benefits of $46.3 million in income
from continuing operations and $18.4 million in income from
discontinued operations related to the following items:

During 2003, we recognized in earnings a
    tax benefit of $69.4 million related to a federal research
    and experimentation credit refund claim for the years 1997
    through 2001. Of this amount, $66.4 million is reflected as
    a reduction of the United States income tax provision and
    $3.0 million is reflected as a reduction of the state and
    local income tax provision.

Income Taxes — (Continued)

Net
current deferred income tax assets at September 30, 2005
and 2004 consist of the tax effects of temporary differences
related to the following (in millions):

Total
deferred tax assets were $426.8 million at
September 30, 2005 and $355.1 million at
September 30, 2004. Total deferred tax liabilities were
$135.6 million at September 30, 2005 and
$147.3 million at September 30, 2004.

We
reclassified our tax audit accrual as of September 30, 2004
from Deferred income taxes (non-current) to Other liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The reclassification resulted in
a remaining net non-current deferred tax asset of
$12.1 million at September 30, 2004, which is reported
as a non-current asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We
believe it is more likely than not that we will realize current
and long-term deferred tax assets through the reduction of
future taxable income, other than as reflected below for tax
attributes to be carried forward. Significant factors we
considered in determining the probability of the realization of
the deferred tax assets include: (a) our historical
operating results ($261.0 million of United States taxable
income over the past three years), (b) expected future
earnings, and (c) the extended period of time over which
the retiree medical benefits will be paid.

Net
operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards,
valuation allowances and the related carryforward periods at
September 30, 2005 are (in millions):

We
have a valuation allowance at September 30, 2005 as noted
above for carryforwards for which future use is uncertain.

During
2005, the valuation allowance decreased by $7.5 million as
a result of a basis adjustment in connection with the filing of
the 2004 income tax return related to the sale of FirstPoint
Contact and the recording of a valuation allowance for
non-U.S. net operating losses.

We
operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to
regular examinations by various U.S. Federal, state and
foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we
have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in
connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior
years. Our income tax positions are based on research and
interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of
the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the
subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each
jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between
those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in
estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters,
our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual
payments or assessments.

Cross
jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving
the transfer price for products, services, and/or intellectual
property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise
our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess
our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities
for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and
penalties, if any, according to the principles of
SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.

We
have recorded an accrual of $103.1 million and
$111.7 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome
of current and future audits and is recorded in Other
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The change in the
accrual reflects a reduction of $34.6 million related
primarily to settlement of the 1998 — 2002
U.S. federal audit, offset by an increase of
$26.0 million to the accrual for changes in estimates and
additional interest related to previously identified income tax
exposures. A final determination of these tax audits or changes
in our estimates may result in additional future income tax
expense or benefit.

September 30, 2005, were approximately $510.0 million.
Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it
is not practicable to determine the U.S. or state income
tax liabilities that would be payable if such earnings were not
reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for
non-U.S. affiliates when we plan to remit those earnings.

Income taxes paid were $134.8 million during 2005,
$30.0 million during 2004 and $84.5 million during

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Environmental Matters

Federal,
state and local requirements relating to the discharge of
substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous
wastes and other activities affecting the environment have and
will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations.
Thus far, compliance with environmental requirements and
resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished
without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources,
competitive position or financial condition.

We
have been designated as a potentially responsible party at 12
Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records
disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability
has been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We
estimate the total reasonably possible costs we could incur for
the remediation of Superfund sites at September 30, 2005 to
be $7.1 million, of which $3.8 million has been
accrued.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —(Continued)

Commitments and Contingent
    Liabilities — (Continued)

Various
other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted
against us alleging violations of federal, state and local
environmental protection requirements, or seeking remediation of
alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously
owned properties. As of September 30, 2005, we have
estimated the total reasonably possible costs we could incur
from these matters to be $82.5 million. We have recorded
environmental accruals for these matters of $34.3 million.
In addition to the above matters, we assumed certain other
environmental liabilities in connection with the 1995
acquisition of Reliance. We are indemnified by ExxonMobil
Corporation (Exxon) for substantially all costs associated with
these Reliance matters. At September 30, 2005, we have
recorded a liability of $22.6 million and a receivable of
$21.4 million for these Reliance matters. We estimate the
total reasonably possible costs for these matters to be
$35.0 million for which we are substantially indemnified by
Exxon.

Based
on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for
environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to
comply with present regulations governing environmental
protection and other expenditures for the resolution of
environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on
our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or
financial condition. We cannot assess the possible effect of
compliance with future requirements.

Lease Commitments

Rental
expense was $88.0 million in 2005; $85.2 million in
2004; and $80.7 million in 2003. Minimum future rental
commitments under operating leases having noncancelable lease
terms in excess of one year aggregated $206.5 million as of
September 30, 2005 and are payable as follows (in
millions):

from third parties under sublease agreements having

receivable through 2010 at approximately $2.7 million per
year. Most leases contain renewal options for varying periods,
and certain leases include options to purchase the leased
property.

Other Matters

Various
lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted
or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business,
including those pertaining to product liability, safety and
health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters.
Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of
matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material
adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We
(including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in
lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos that was used in certain components of our products
many years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in
lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of
other companies. The great bulk of the complaints, however, do
not identify any of our products or specify which of these
claimants, if any, were exposed to asbestos attributable to our
products; and past experience has shown



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —(Continued)

17.

Commitments and Contingent
    Liabilities — (Continued)

that the vast majority of the claimants will never identify any
of our products. In addition, when our products appear to be
identified, they are frequently from divested businesses, and we
are indemnified for most of the costs. For those claimants who
do show that they worked with our products, we nevertheless
believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to
the integrity of our products, the encapsulated nature of any
asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing
medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those
cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the
vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We
have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers
indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured
retentions, for most of these claims. We initiated litigation in
the Milwaukee County Circuit Court on February 12, 2004 to
enforce the insurance policies against Nationwide Indemnity
Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that
provided liability insurance coverage to our former
Allen-Bradley subsidiary. As a result, the insurance carriers
have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed
to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity
costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims, subject to policy
limits. If either carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits
of either carrier are exhausted, our share of future defense and
indemnity costs may increase. However, coverage under excess
policies may be available to pay some or all of these
costs.

The
uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term
solvency of our insurance companies make it difficult to predict
accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That
uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings
or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the
settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on
our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe
these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.

In
connection with the divestiture of our former aerospace and
defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company
(Boeing), we agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters
related to operations of the A&D Business for periods prior
to the divestiture. In connection with the spinoffs of our
former automotive component systems business, semiconductor
systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and
communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities
related to the respective businesses, including environmental
and intellectual property matters.

We
have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In
connection with such divestitures, lawsuits, claims and
proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to
the period that we owned the businesses.

In
many countries we provide a limited intellectual property
indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale. We also
at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in
other contracts with third parties, such as contracts
concerning: the development and manufacture of our products; the
divestiture of businesses; and the licensing of intellectual
property. Due to the number of agreements containing such
provisions, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential
future payments. However, we believe that future payments, if
any, would not be material to our business or financial
condition.

Among
other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate
resources based upon segment operating earnings before income
taxes, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices,
certain non-recurring corporate initiatives, gains and losses
from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses from
equity affiliates that are not considered part of the operations
of a particular segment and incremental acquisition related
expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments such as
intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory and
purchased research and development charges. Depending on the
product, intersegment sales are either at a market price or cost
plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market
price. In preparing the segment information, we use accounting
policies consistent with those described in Note 1.

Subsequent Events

In
November 2005, the Company completed a sale-leaseback
transaction of 24 properties, including the land, buildings and
improvements affixed to the properties. The lease terms vary
from five to fifteen years depending on the property and will be
classified as operating leases. The net proceeds on sale were
approximately $148 million, which were used to repay
commercial paper borrowings. Three of the sold properties
resulted in a loss of $2.0 million that will be recognized
in our first quarter of 2006, the remaining properties resulted
in a gain on sale of $36 million that will be amortized to
rent expense over the term of the respective leases. The average
operating lease commitment for the first five years is
$12 million per year and $10 million per year
thereafter.

On
October 11, 2005, we issued unsecured commercial paper
obligations of $300.0 million with various maturities of
between 1 and 28 days. We used the proceeds to partially
fund a $450 million voluntary contribution to our
U.S. qualified pension trust.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareowners
equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 2005. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15(a) (2). These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company at September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 2005, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, such financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
November 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness, as of
September 30, 2005, of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of September 30, 2005.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of September 30, 2005.

Our
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2005 has been
audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
that is included below.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During
2005, we continued to make improvements to the design and
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting,
including those related to our information technology systems,
as part of a previously existing overall program on internal
control and as part of the process of preparing for compliance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Some of
these changes, especially to our internal controls related to
information technology systems, could be deemed to have
materially improved our internal control over financial
reporting. We anticipate that we will continue to make
improvements.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

We
have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Rockwell Automation, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2005, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
September 30, 2005 of the Company and our report dated
November 10, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule.
