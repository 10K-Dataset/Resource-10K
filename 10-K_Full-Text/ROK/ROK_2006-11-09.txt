for additional information.

Item 1.

Business

General

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of
industrial automation power, control and information products and services. The Company was
incorporated in Delaware in 1996 in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December
6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D
Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, the former Rockwell International
Corporation (RIC) contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company
and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC.
RIC was incorporated in 1928.

On June 29, 2001, we completed the spinoff of our Rockwell Collins avionics and communications
business into an independent, separately traded, publicly held company named Rockwell Collins, Inc.
(Rockwell Collins). In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business. Additional
information related to this divestiture is contained in Note 13 in the Financial Statements.

In June 2006, we announced our intention to divest our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric
motors and motor repair services businesses. These are the principal businesses of our Power
Systems operating segment. These businesses are reflected in continuing operations for all periods
presented as the criteria for discontinued operations prescribed by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,

had not been met as of September 30, 2006, the date in which this standard requires the
criteria to be assessed. On
November 7, 2006, we announced that we have entered into a
definitive agreement to sell these businesses to Baldor Electric
Company (Baldor) for $1.8 billion, comprised of $1.75 billion in
cash and $50 million in Baldor common stock. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory
approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of our fiscal
2007. In subsequent
filings these businesses will be reported as discontinued operations.


In September 2006, we and Rockwell Collins sold our investment in Rockwell Scientific Company
LLC (RSC). Before the sale, we and Rockwell Collins each owned 50 percent of RSC. Additional
information regarding the sale of RSC is contained in Note 14 in the Financial Statements.

As used herein, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Rockwell Automation” include
subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.

Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy
Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareowners of the Company to be held on February 7, 2007 (the
2007 Proxy Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7.

Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(

), or in Item 8.

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

(the Financial Statements), the information is incorporated in
that Item by reference. All date references to years refer to our fiscal year unless otherwise
stated.

Operating Segments

We have two operating segments: Control Systems and Power Systems. In 2006, our total sales
were $5.6 billion. Financial information with respect to our operating segments, including their
contributions to sales and operating earnings for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2006, is contained under the caption

Results of Operations

in

MD&A

, and in Note 18 in
the Financial Statements.

Effective October 1, 2006, we have realigned our internal management reporting structure. The
reporting structure changes include realignment of our Control Systems’ services and solutions
offerings to report through the Components and Packaged Applications Group (CPAG). Additionally,
the Power Systems custom drives and drives related parts and services business has been realigned
to also report through CPAG. As a result of changes in the internal management reporting structure,
we will begin reporting the historical Control Systems operating segment as two separate operating
segments in our first quarter of 2007.

Control Systems

Control Systems is our largest operating segment with 2006 sales of $4.6 billion (82 percent
of our total sales) and approximately 19,000 employees at September 30, 2006. Control Systems
supplies industrial automation products, systems, software and services focused on helping
customers control and improve manufacturing processes. The operating segment includes two main
business groups: CPAG and the Automation Control and Information Group (ACIG).

CPAG supplies industrial components, power control and motor management products, and packaged
and engineered products and systems. CPAG’s sales account for approximately 39 percent of Control
Systems’ sales.

ACIG’s core products are used primarily to control and monitor industrial plants and processes
and typically consist of a processor, software and input/output (I/O) devices. ACIG’s integrated
architecture and Logix controllers perform multiple types of control applications, including
discrete, batch, continuous process, drive system, motion and machine safety across various factory
floor operations. ACIG’s sales account for approximately 45 percent of Control Systems’ sales.

In addition, Control Systems’ offerings also include services and solutions, such as
multi-vendor customer support, training, automation systems integration, asset management, and
manufacturing information solutions for discrete and targeted batch process industries. Control
Systems’ service and solution offerings compete with Emerson Electric Co., General Electric
Company, Invensys, Siemens AG and system integrators.


The following is a summary of the major products and services and major competitors of Control
Systems’ two main business groups:

Depending on the product or service involved, Control Systems’ competitors range from large
diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation, to smaller companies
specializing in niche products and services. Factors that influence Control Systems’ competitive
position are its broad product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology leadership, knowledge
of customer applications, large installed base, established distribution network, quality of
products and services, price and global presence.

Control Systems’ products are marketed primarily under the Allen-Bradley

®

and Rockwell
Software

®

brand names. Major markets served include consumer products, transportation, oil and
gas, mining, metals and forest products.

In North America, Control Systems’ products are sold primarily through independent
distributors that typically do not carry products that compete with Allen-Bradley

®

products. Large
systems and service offerings are sold principally through a direct sales force, though
opportunities are sometimes sourced through distributors or system integrators. Product sales
outside the United States occur through a combination of direct sales, sales through distributors
and sales through system integrators.

In 2006, sales in the United States accounted for 57 percent of Control Systems’ sales.
Outside the U.S., Control Systems’ primary markets were Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Italy,
Germany, Brazil, Australia, Korea and Mexico.

Control Systems is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and has operations in North America;
Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia-Pacific; and Latin America.

Power Systems

Power Systems recorded 2006 sales of $1.0 billion (18 percent of our total sales) and had
approximately 4,000 employees at September 30, 2006. Power Systems consists of two business
groups: Dodge mechanical (Mechanical) and Reliance electrical (Electrical).

Depending on the product involved, Power Systems’ competitors range from large
diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation, to smaller companies
specializing in niche products and services. Factors that influence Power Systems’ competitive
position are product quality, installed base, price and our established distributor network. While
Power Systems’ competitive position is strong in the United States, it is limited somewhat by its
small presence outside the United States.

Mechanical’s products are marketed primarily under the Dodge

®

brand name while Electrical’s
products are marketed primarily under the Reliance

®

and Reliance Electric

TM

brand names.
Major markets served include mining, cement, aggregates, environmental, forest products,
food/beverage, oil and gas, metals and material handling.

Mechanical’s products are sold primarily through distributors while Electrical’s products are
sold primarily through a direct sales force.

In 2006, sales in the United States accounted for 85 percent of Power Systems’ sales. Outside
the U.S., Power Systems’ primary markets were Canada, China and Mexico.

Power Systems is headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina and has operations in North
America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.

Geographic Information

In 2006, sales in the United States accounted for 62 percent of our total sales. Our
principal markets outside the United States are in Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Italy,
Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and Korea. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

for a discussion of risks
associated with our operations outside of the United States.

At September 30, 2006 we had approximately 23,000 employees. Approximately 14,000 were
employed in the United States, and, of these employees, about 5 percent were represented by various
local or national unions.

Raw Materials and Supplies

We purchase many items of equipment, components and materials used to produce our products
from others. The raw materials essential to the conduct of each of our business segments generally
are available at competitive prices. Although we have a broad base of suppliers and
subcontractors, we depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance
and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

for a discussion of
risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers.

Backlog

Our total order backlog was $911.7 million at September 30, 2006 and $772.5 million at
September 30, 2005. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future
periods due to the short-cycle nature of most of our sales activities.

Environmental Protection Requirements

Information about the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and
resolution of environmental claims is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. See also
Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

We own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and
operations. Various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have
been made to us. We believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition. See Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

. While in the aggregate our patents and
licenses are important in the operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or termination
of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition. See Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property.

The Company’s name and its registered trademark “Rockwell Automation

®

” is important to each of
our business segments. In addition, we own other important trademarks
that we use for certain products
and services, such as “Allen-Bradley

®

” and “A-B

®

” for electronic controls and systems for
industrial automation, “Reliance

®

” and “Reliance Electric

TM

” for electric motors and
drives and
“Dodge

®

”
for mechanical power transmission products. Although we have
announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the principal
businesses of our Power Systems operating segment, we will
retain the Reliance Electric

TM

and Reliance

®

branded drives business and related parts
and services as an integral part of our global drives and services
businesses. We will retain a long-term license to the Reliance

®

and Reliance Electric

TM

trademarks
in connection with the drives business.


Seasonality

Our business segments are not subject to significant seasonality. However, the
calendarization of our results can be affected by the seasonal capital spending patterns of our
customers due to their annual capital budgeting processes and their working schedules combined with
seasonal changes in the composition of the products and services our customers purchase.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the
risks of doing business outside of the United States.

Approximately 38 percent of our revenues in 2006 were outside of the U.S. Future growth rates
and success of our business depend in large part on continued growth in our non-U.S. operations.
Numerous risks and uncertainties affect our non-U.S. operations. These risks and uncertainties
include political and economic instability, changes in local governmental laws, regulations and
policies, including those related to tariffs, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment
regulations and repatriation of earnings, and enforcement of contract and intellectual property
rights. International transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to
differing legal systems and customs, including risks of non-compliance with U.S. and local laws
affecting our activities abroad. In addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates. While these factors and the impact of these
factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or operating results.

An inability to anticipate changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our
products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the
changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new
products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and
costly. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to
changes in customer preferences, demand for our products could decline and our operating results
would be adversely affected.

General economic, business or industry conditions may result in a decrease in our revenues and
profitability.

Demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global industrial production. As
economic activity slows down, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, resulting
in decreased demand for our products. If this occurs, our revenues and profitability may be
negatively affected.

Information technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business.

We depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our
business objectives. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a
computer virus, a problem with the functioning of an important IT application, or an intentional
disruption of our IT systems by a third party, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability
to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our
business in the ordinary course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and
could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related
security concerns.


We are in the process of introducing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that
will redesign and deploy new processes, organization structures and a common information system
over a period of several years. Our first significant roll-outs of the system are scheduled to
occur at several of our U.S. locations in fiscal 2007. As we implement the ERP system, the new
system may not perform as expected. This could have an adverse effect on our business.

The growth of our Control Systems solutions offerings may create additional risks.

Risks inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming greater responsibility
for project completion and success, defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing
projects, and managing the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors. Our inability to control,
manage, and mitigate these risks could adversely affect our results of operations.

The global industrial automation power, control and information products and services industry is
highly competitive.

We face strong competition in all of our market segments in several specific respects,
including pricing, product performance, developing integrated systems and applications that address
the business challenges faced by our customers and customer service. The relative importance of
these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve. Price
competition in our various industries is intense. We seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by
continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements. If we fail
to keep pace with technological changes, we may experience price erosion and lower margins. We
expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit our ability
to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.

A disruption to our distribution channel could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

In the United States and Canada, approximately 75 percent of our sales are through a limited
number of third party distributors. While we maintain the right to appoint new distributors, any
unplanned disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
A disruption could be caused by the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability
of the distributor, or other events.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims) could adversely affect
our business.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to
the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, safety and health,
employment and contract matters. We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal
injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many
years ago. The uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties
related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate
resolution.

The inability to secure and maintain rights to intellectual property could harm our business and
our customers.

We own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important
to our business. The loss of patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business may
have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Expenses related to enforcing our
intellectual property rights could be significant. In addition, others may assert intellectual
property infringement claims against us or our customers. We sometimes provide a limited
intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our
customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. Indemnification payments and legal
costs to defend claims could have an adverse effect on our business.

Dispositions of businesses involve risks and uncertainties.

Our
business strategy and long-term objectives may result in decisions to dispose of assets or
businesses. The disposition of assets or businesses can be highly uncertain. In June 2006 we
announced our intention to divest the principal businesses of our
Power Systems operating segment and on November 7, 2006, we announced
that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell these
businesses to Baldor Electric Company. The transaction is subject to
customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. Any failures or
delays in satisfying closing conditions for this divestiture or
difficulties in re-deploying
the proceeds to minimize the dilutive effect of the sale could have
an adverse effect on our ability to execute on our strategy.

Our reliance on third party suppliers creates certain risks and uncertainties.

Our manufacturing processes require that we purchase a high volume of equipment, components
and materials from third party suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves certain risks,
including:

•

the cost of these purchases may change due to inflation, exchange rates or other factors;

•

poor quality can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our products; and

•

a shortage of components or materials could adversely affect our manufacturing
efficiencies and delivery capabilities, which could reduce sales and profitability.


Any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete.
We also maintain several single-source supplier relationships, because either alternative sources
are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support,
delivery, capacity, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source
components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in desired
quantities and in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more
severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products. Even where alternative
sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable
supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues.

Potential liabilities and costs relating to environmental remediation could adversely affect our
business.

Our operations, both in the United States and abroad, are subject to regulation by various
environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health,
the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground and waters, the quality
of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances.
Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change. Our financial responsibility for
the cleanup or other remediation of contaminated property or for natural resource damages may
extend to previously owned or used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated
companies or individuals, as well as properties that we currently own and use, regardless of
whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners.

We have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in
the future as well, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be
significant.

The inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities related to our current and
divested businesses could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.

We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and
rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those
jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax
liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related
to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.
In connection with the divestiture of certain businesses in prior years, we retained tax
liabilities and the rights to tax refunds for periods before the divestitures. As a result, from
time to time, we may be required to make payments related to tax matters associated with those
divested businesses.

Natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions to our
operations could harm our business.

Natural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the
actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events could cause
damage or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers, or our customers, and could create
political or economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could
decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or
disrupt our supply chain.

Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue or
profitability.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key
employees. Their skills, experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and
administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and key
employees could have a negative effect on our operating results.

Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us.

We have acquired, and anticipate continuing to acquire, businesses in an effort to enhance
shareowner value. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including:

•

difficulties integrating the acquired business, retaining the acquired business’
customers, and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as revenue
increases, cost savings, and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired
time frames, if at all;

•

loss of key employees of the acquired business;

•

difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures,
policies and information systems; and

•

diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.

Future acquisitions could cause us to incur debt, dilution, contingent liabilities, increased
interest expense, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Impairment losses on
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, or restructuring charges, could also occur
as a result of acquisitions.

Properties

At September 30, 2006, we operated 73 plants, principally in North America. We also had 284
sales and administrative offices and a total of 41 warehouses, service centers and other
facilities. The aggregate floor space of our facilities was approximately 14.1 million square
feet. Of this floor space, we owned approximately 23 percent and leased approximately 77 percent.
Manufacturing space occupied approximately 6.3 million square feet. Our Control Systems segment
occupied approximately 3.3 million square feet, and our Power Systems segment occupied the
remaining approximately 3.0 million square feet of manufacturing space. At September 30, 2006,
approximately 450 thousand square feet of floor space was not in use, principally in owned
facilities.

In November 2005, we sold and leased back 24 properties in North America comprising
approximately 3.8 million square feet. See Note 17 in the Financial Statements for additional
information.

There are no major encumbrances (other than financing arrangements, which in the aggregate are
not significant) on any of our plants or equipment. In our opinion, our properties have been well
maintained, are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to
operate at present levels.

Legal Proceedings

Rocky
Flats Plant

. RIC operated the Rocky Flats Plant (the Plant), Golden, Colorado, from
1975 through December 1989 for the Department of Energy (DOE). Incident to Boeing’s acquisition of
RIC in 1996, we assumed and agreed to indemnify RIC and Boeing for any liability arising out of
RIC’s activities at the Plant to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the
government, and RIC and Boeing assigned to us the right to any reimbursements or other proceeds to
which they might be entitled under RIC’s Rocky Flats contracts with the DOE.

On January 30, 1990, a class action was filed in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado against RIC and another former operator of the Plant. The action alleges the
improper production, handling and disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances,
constituting, among other things, violations of various environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations, and misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto. On October 8,
1993, the court certified separate medical monitoring and property value classes. On February 14,
2006, a jury empanelled to try certain of the class action plaintiffs’ property damage claims found
the contractor defendants liable for trespass and nuisance, and awarded $176 million in
compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages against the two defendants collectively.
The jury also found RIC to be 10% responsible for the trespass and 70% responsible for the
nuisance. No appealable judgment has been entered on the jury verdict, in part because the court
has yet to decide how the damages are to be allocated between the defendants and among the
plaintiff class members. Appeals are likely after judgment is entered. Effective August 1, 1996,
the DOE assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants, including RIC, in the action
and has either reimbursed or paid directly the costs of RIC’s defense. We believe that RIC is
entitled under applicable law and its contract with the DOE to be indemnified for the verdict and
other costs associated with this action.


On November 13, 1990, RIC was served with another civil action brought against it in the same
court by James Stone, claiming to act in the name of the United States, alleging violations of the
U.S. False Claims Act in connection with its operation of the Plant (and seeking treble damages and
forfeitures). On December 6, 1995, the DOE notified RIC that it would no longer reimburse costs
incurred by RIC in defense of the action. On November 19, 1996, the court granted the Department
of Justice leave to intervene in the case on the government’s behalf. On April 1, 1999 a jury
awarded the plaintiffs approximately $1.4 million in damages. On May 18, 1999, the court entered
judgment against RIC for approximately $4.2 million, trebling the jury’s award as required by the
False Claims Act, and imposing a civil penalty of $15,000. If the judgment is affirmed on appeal,
Mr. Stone will also be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees but the court refused to award fees
until appeals from the judgment have been exhausted. On September 24, 2001, a panel of the

th

Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. On November 2, 2001, RIC filed a
petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeals seeking reconsideration of that portion of the
decision holding that Mr. Stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees. On March 4, 2002, the
Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of making findings of
fact and conclusions of law pertaining to Mr. Stone’s relator status and, the trial court having
made findings of fact on the issue, on March 15, 2004, a panel of the Court of Appeals again ruled
that Mr. Stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees. On January 4, 2006, the 10

th

Circuit Court of Appeals denied en banc review, and on April 4, 2006, RIC filed a petition for
certiorari seeking Supreme Court review of the 10

th

Circuit’s decision. On September 25,
2006 the Supreme Court granted our petition for certiorari and set the case for argument on
December 5, 2006. We believe that RIC is entitled under applicable law and its contract with the
DOE to be indemnified for all costs and any liability associated with this action, and RIC has
filed a claim with the DOE seeking reimbursement that is described more fully below. We believe
that an outcome adverse to RIC will not have a material effect on our business or financial
condition.

On January 8, 1991, RIC filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims against the
DOE, seeking recovery of $6.5 million of award fees that it alleges are owed to it under the terms
of its contract with the DOE for management and operation of the Plant during the period October 1,
1988 through September 30, 1989. On July 17, 1996, the government filed an amended answer and
counterclaim alleging violations of the U.S. False Claims Act previously asserted in the Stone
civil action described in the preceding paragraph. On May 4, 2005, RIC filed another claim with
the DOE, seeking recovery of $11.3 million in unreimbursed costs incurred in defense of the Stone
suit. On September 30, 2005, the DOE Contracting Officer denied that claim and demanded repayment
of $4 million in previously reimbursed Stone defense costs. On November 10, 2005, RIC appealed both
aspects of the Contracting Officer’s decision regarding Stone defense costs to the Energy Board of
Contract Appeals. Both parties have filed motions for summary judgment. In the second quarter of
2006, we recorded a $5.0 million ($3.0 million after-tax) accrual in discontinued operations for
legal contingencies related to this matter.

Russellville

. On March 24, 1997, the Circuit Court of Franklin County, Kentucky in

Commonwealth of Kentucky, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet vs. Rockwell

, an
action filed in 1986 seeking remediation of PCB contamination resulting from unpermitted discharges
of PCBs from a plant in Russellville, Kentucky owned and operated by RIC’s Measurement & Flow
Control Division before its divestiture in March 1989, entered judgment establishing PCB cleanup
levels for the former plant site and certain offsite property and ordering additional
characterization of possible contamination in the Mud River and its flood plain. The Court
deferred any decision to impose civil penalties pending implementation of an appropriate
remediation program. On August 13, 1999, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s judgment,
a ruling that the Kentucky Supreme Court has let stand. We have been proceeding with remediation
and characterization efforts consistent with the trial court’s ruling.

Solaia Technology LLC.

For nearly five years we were a party in several suits in which one
or both of Solaia Technology LLC (Solaia) and Schneider Automation, Inc (Schneider) were adverse to
us. In 2001, Solaia acquired U.S. Patent No. 5,038,318 (the ‘318 patent) from Schneider, a
competitor in the field of factory automation. Schneider retained certain interests in the ‘318
patent, including a share in any licensing income. Solaia, formed to license and enforce the ‘318
patent, asserted that the patent covers computer-controlled factory automation systems used
throughout most modern factories in the United States, issued demand letters to a wide range of
factory owners and operators, and filed lawsuits for alleged infringement of the ‘318 patent.

Among other lawsuits filed by Solaia concerning the ‘318 patent, Solaia filed suit on July 2,
2002 accusing sixteen companies of infringing the ‘318 patent.

Solaia Technology LLC v.
ArvinMeritor, Inc., et al

. (02-C-4704, N.D. Ill.) (the Chicago patent suit). We believed that
Solaia’s claims in the Chicago patent suit were without merit and baseless, and in December 2002,
we sought to protect our customers from Solaia’s claims by bringing an action in federal court in
Milwaukee against Solaia, its law firm Niro, Scavone, Haller & Niro, and Schneider.

Rockwell
Automation, Inc., et al. v. Schneider Automation, Inc., et al

(Case No. 02-C-1195 E.D. Wis.) (the
Milwaukee action). On May 12, 2003, Solaia sued us directly in the Chicago patent suit for patent
infringement.


In April 2006, following rulings in our favor on motions for summary judgment, we entered into
an agreement with Solaia and its law firm that ended the Chicago patent suit and provided that the
various other lawsuits between us and Solaia and its law firm would be dismissed. Separately, in
October 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with Schneider that ended the Milwaukee
action. All lawsuits concerning the Company and the ‘318 patent are now completely resolved.

Asbestos.

Like thousands of other companies, we (including our subsidiaries) have been named
as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was
used in certain components of our products many years ago. Currently there are thousands of
claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. The
great bulk of the complaints, however, do not identify any of our products or specify which of
these claimants, if any, were exposed to asbestos attributable to our products; and past experience
has shown that the vast majority of the claimants will never identify any of our products.

In addition, when our products appear to be identified, they are frequently from divested
businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. For those claimants who do show that
they worked with our products, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial
part due to the integrity of our products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing
components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants. We
defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of
these claims with no payment to claimants.

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over
and above self-insured retentions, for most of these claims. We initiated litigation in the
Milwaukee County Circuit Court on February 12, 2004 to enforce the insurance policies against
Nationwide Indemnity Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that provided liability
insurance coverage to our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. As a result, the insurance carriers
have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed to pay the substantial majority of
future defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims, subject to policy limits. If
either carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits of either carrier are exhausted, our share of
future defense and indemnity costs may increase. However, coverage under excess policies may be
available to pay some or all of these costs.

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term solvency of our insurance
companies make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That
uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting
asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on
our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

As a result of an internal review, we determined during the
fourth quarter of 2006 that actions by a small number of employees at certain of our operations in
one jurisdiction may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other
applicable laws. We and some of our distributors do business in this jurisdiction with government
owned enterprises or government owned enterprises that are evolving to commercial businesses.
These actions involved payments for non-business travel expenses and certain other business
arrangements involving potentially improper payment mechanisms for legitimate business expenses.
Special outside counsel has been engaged to investigate the actions and report to the Audit
Committee. Their review is ongoing.

We voluntarily disclosed these actions to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) beginning in September 2006. We are implementing
thorough remedial measures, and are cooperating on these issues with the DOJ and SEC. We have
agreed to update the DOJ and SEC periodically regarding any further developments as the
investigation continues.

If violations of the FCPA occurred, we may be subject to consequences that could include
fines, penalties, other costs and business-related impacts. We could also face similar
consequences from local authorities. While we are not in a position to reasonably estimate
potential consequences at this time, we do not believe the consequences of this investigation, the
remediation or any related penalties or business related impacts have had or will have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Other.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or
asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product
liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract
matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits,
claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters
that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
financial condition.

Overview

Overall demand for our products and services is driven by:

U. S. Industrial Economic Trends

In 2006, sales in the U.S. accounted for more than 62 percent of our total sales. The trend
of improving conditions in the U.S. manufacturing economy during 2004 and 2005 continued into the
first half of 2006 and moderated somewhat in the second half. The various indicators we use to
gauge the direction and momentum of our served markets include:

•

Industrial Equipment Spending, which is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad
U.S. industrial economy, which includes our primary customer base. This measure, over the
longer term, has proven to have reasonable predictive value, and to be a good directional
indicator of our growth trend.

•

Capacity Utilization, which is an indication of plant operating activity published by
the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between Capacity
Utilization and the level of capital investment made by our customers in their
manufacturing base.

•

The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management
(ISM), which is an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According
to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally
expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.


The table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in U.S. Industrial Equipment
Spending and Capacity Utilization, and the sustained strength in the PMI since December 2003.
While we still expect moderate growth in 2007, we are planning for a deceleration to a more
sustainable level of growth in the U.S. economy in 2007.

Non-U.S. Regional Trends

Outside the U.S., demand is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in
each region and by our customers’ ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets.
These customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and growing
indigenous companies. Recent strength in demand has, in part, been driven by investment in
infrastructure in developing economies, in basic materials production capacity in response to
higher-end product pricing and in expanding consumer markets. We continue to see strong demand in
China, India and Latin America. We also saw considerable growth in Europe during the second half
of 2006, following nearly two years of little or no growth. In 2006, our European operations
benefited from our targeted growth investments in customer-facing resources as well as improving
macro-economic conditions. We expect strong growth in Latin America, Europe and the emerging
economies in Asia Pacific will continue into 2007.

Industry Views

We serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products, transportation,
basic materials, and oil and gas. During 2006 we benefited from growing demand in most of the
industries we serve.

Our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage; home, health and
beauty; and life sciences industries. These customers’ needs include global expansion,
incremental capacity from existing facilities, an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment
and regulatory compliance. In addition, these customers operate in an environment where product
innovation and time to market are critical factors. As a result, consumer products customers’
capital investments are generally less cyclical than those of heavy manufacturing customers.

In transportation, factors such as plant closings, customer investment in new model
introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales. While our global
automotive revenue was flat in 2006, our traditional North American automotive installed base
experienced a significant slowdown during the second half of the year. This had a negative impact
on sales and operating earnings in our Control Systems business, primarily on sales of our Logix
and PLC products. Our plan for 2007 does not anticipate any recovery.

Our customers in basic materials industries, including mining, aggregates, metals, forest
products and cement, all benefit from higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic
materials, both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries.

As energy prices rise, customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in
production and transmission capacity. During 2006, high energy prices contributed to strong
growth in resource and energy based industries.

In addition, higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to
consider investing in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as
intelligent motor controls.

Outlook for 2007

The following is a summary of key objectives for 2007:

•

Successfully complete the divestiture of the principal businesses of our Power
Systems operating segment;

•

Execute our cost productivity initiatives;

•

Continue our globalization efforts with a particular focus on emerging markets; and

•

Sustain the growth of our integrated control and information architecture by
accelerating the proliferation and adoption rate, enhancing features and
functionality, and by aggressively pursuing growth in an expanded addressable market.

Our key objectives assume a certain amount of cost productivity in 2007. Our cost
productivity initiatives will likely include workforce reductions and facility rationalization.
These actions are consistent with the planned divestiture of most of our Power Systems operating
segment and our globalization and cost productivity efforts. Costs associated with these actions
will be recorded when the relevant recognition criteria have been met.

Our outlook for 2007 is based on expected demand and assumes sustained momentum outside of
North America with slower rates of growth in the U.S. and Canada than in the previous three years.
Our outlook also assumes sustained momentum across most industrial end markets. The actual
growth reported in any particular quarter may out perform or lag that trend. This oscillation of
performance around a trend is attributed to the inherent variability in our business with short
lead times and minimal backlog in our non-project businesses. Extrapolation of growth rates or
levels of profitability from any one quarter can lead to incorrect conclusions about future
performance.

As of the date of filing this report, based upon current economic conditions and business
trends, we expect to grow revenue in 2007 by 7 to 8 percent, consistent with our long-term growth
trend. As of the date hereof, we also expect full year 2007 diluted earnings per share to be in
the range of $3.70 to $3.90. This includes an expected effective income tax rate that will average
about 32 percent for the full year, excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures or other
items separately reported net of their related tax effects. This tax rate assumes continued
execution of our globalization strategy. We also plan to generate free cash flow approximately
equal to net income. This guidance does not incorporate the impact of future acquisitions or
divestures, including the planned divestiture of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors
and motor repair services businesses.

Sales

Sales increased 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 with double digit growth at both Control
Systems and Power Systems. Total sales were not significantly affected year over year by changes
in currency exchange rates. Sales in the U.S. and Canada increased by 11 percent in 2006 compared
to 2005. Sales in the U.S. and Canada benefited from the strength in our power-centric businesses,
however, were negatively impacted by the weakness in the North American automotive market in the
second half of the year. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew by 11 percent in 2006 compared to
2005 with particularly strong growth in the emerging economies, including China and India. Latin
America sales grew by 19 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the effect of currency
translation, led by strength in the oil and gas and mining industries. Sales in Europe grew by 7
percent in 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the effects of currency translation. Europe
experienced considerable growth during the second half of 2006. Our operations in Europe benefited
from our investment in customer facing resources and improving macro-economic conditions.

Segment Operating Earnings

Segment operating earnings increased by $168.5 million from 2005 to $1,035.7 million in 2006.
Segment operating earnings benefited from higher volume, productivity programs and favorable
pricing, partially offset by inflation and higher growth initiative spending in comparison to the
prior year. Segment operating earnings in 2006 include $19.8 million of stock compensation expense
due to the adoption of a new accounting standard, SFAS 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)).
Additionally, 2006 results include $27.3 million of increased pension and retiree medical expense
compared to 2005. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a benefit of $12.3 million related to
an insurance settlement and a charge of $21.5 million related to special charges associated with
restructuring activities in Europe and a U.S. plant closing.

General Corporate — Net

General corporate expenses were $92.5 million in 2006 compared to $69.7 million in 2005. The
increase includes $9.7 million of stock compensation expense, lower interest income and
higher contributions to the Rockwell Automation Charitable Corporation.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $58.4 million in 2006 compared to $45.8 million in 2005. The increase
was due to our commercial paper borrowings during 2006, as well as higher interest rates associated
with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements).

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2006 was 29.5 percent compared to 29.7 percent in 2005. The 2006
effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent due to the reversal of
$27.2 million ($0.15 per diluted share) of valuation allowances on capital loss carryforwards,
settlement of audit matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 2003 and 2004,
lower non-U.S. tax rates, Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extra Territorial Income (ETI) tax
benefits and other provision adjustments.

The effective tax rate for 2005 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent
due to a benefit of $19.7 million ($0.10 per diluted share) related to the settlement of audit
matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 1998 through 2002, utilization of
foreign tax credits, FSC and ETI tax benefits and other provision adjustments.

See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for additional information on tax events in 2006 and
2005 affecting the respective tax rates.

Power Systems sales increased 15 percent compared to 2005 with growth in both our Dodge
mechanical and Reliance electrical business groups. Sales at Power Systems benefited from
continued strong momentum resulting from high energy and commodity prices. These higher prices
resulted in the segment’s predominantly U.S. based customers investing in capacity expansion after
several years of under-investment and reduced capital spending.

Operating Earnings

Power Systems operating earnings grew 47 percent due to higher volume, productivity
initiatives, a balanced dynamic between price and cost, and lower restructuring costs, somewhat
offset by inflation. Segment operating earnings in 2006 include stock compensation expense
of $4.0 million and increased pension and retiree medical expense of $5.8 million compared to 2005.
Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of $5.0 million associated with a facility
closure and the corresponding write-down of property to its fair value.

Sales

Sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004 driven by double digit growth at both Control
Systems and Power Systems. Two percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in
currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the strength of the major European currencies and
the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Sales rose by double digit percentages in all
regions except for EMEA where difficult economic conditions dampened growth in the major economies
of Western Europe, primarily France, Germany and the U.K. The emerging economies in Asia-Pacific,
led by China and India, experienced particularly strong growth. Strength of the oil and gas and
mining industries in Latin America and oil and gas industry in Canada contributed to particularly
strong sales growth in those regions.

Sales in the global water/wastewater, oil and gas, aggregate and cement, and mining industries
grew at a rate higher than our annual growth rate of 13 percent. Sales in the food and
transportation industries grew at rates approximate to our annual growth rate, while sales in life
sciences, semiconductor, and beverage grew at a rate less than our annual growth rate.

Segment Operating Earnings

Segment operating earnings benefited from higher volume, productivity programs and favorable
pricing offset slightly by inflation in comparison to the prior year. Additionally, segment
operating earnings in 2005 include $21.5 million related to special charges associated with
restructuring activities in Europe and a U.S. plant closing, offset by $12.3 million of benefits
received related to insurance settlements. Segment operating earnings in 2004 include $26.3
million for special facilities related charges.

General Corporate — Net

General corporate expenses were $69.7 million in 2005 compared to $88.3 million in 2004.
Expense decreased primarily due to reduced environmental costs, lower contributions to our
charitable corporation and increased interest income.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $45.8 million in 2005 compared to $41.7 million in 2004, primarily due to
higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial
Statements).

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 29.7 percent in 2005 and 19.2 percent in 2004. The effective tax
rate for 2005 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent due to a benefit of $19.7
million ($0.10 per diluted share) related to the settlement of audit matters with the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service for the years 1998 through 2002, utilization of foreign tax credits, FSC and ETI
tax benefits and other provision adjustments.

The effective tax rate for 2004 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent
due to benefits totaling $46.3 million ($0.24 per diluted share) from the resolution of various tax
matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions, state tax benefits involving refund claims, lower non-U.S. tax
rates, FSC and ETI tax benefits and other provision adjustments.

Control Systems sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004. Three percentage points of the
sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting
from the relative strength of the major European currencies and the Canadian dollar in relation to
the U.S. dollar. Sales of our Logix offering grew by more than 26 percent compared to 2004, which
was somewhat offset by a decline in our legacy control platform products that are being replaced by
Logix. Growth in sales of our Logix offering was driven by our introduction of new functionality
and an expanded addressable market. Our intelligent motor control products also delivered
significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to extraction-based and heavy industrial
customers. Higher commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency programs led to
the strong demand from these customers.

Operating Earnings

Segment operating earnings increased by 43 percent compared to 2004. The increase in segment
operating earnings is due to higher volume, cost productivity and favorable pricing that was
somewhat offset by inflation. Control Systems 2005 results include $12.3 million of benefits
related to insurance settlements offset by $16.5 million of special charges associated with
realignment of administrative functions and a reduction in workforce in Europe. Prior year segment
operating earnings include a $26.3 million charge related to a facilities rationalization program.

Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into
consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute
our strategy. In the first quarter of 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R) (see Note 1 in the Financial
Statements), which requires that we report excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation
as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to
our operating cash flow to present free cash flow on a basis that is consistent with our historical
presentation. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our
ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other
investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow as
one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from
definitions used by other companies.

Free cash flow was $323.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 compared to $514.8
million for the year ended September 30, 2005. Free cash flow in 2006 includes voluntary
contributions to our U.S. pension plan of $450.0 million compared to $150.0 million of such
contributions in 2005. In addition, increased capital spending and working capital in 2006
resulted from the operating growth and growth investments that occurred during the year.

Commercial paper is our principal source of short-term financing. Commercial paper borrowings
outstanding at September 30, 2006 were $219.0 million. The weighted average interest rate on these
borrowings was 5.4 percent. At September 30, 2005, and throughout 2005, we had no commercial paper
borrowings outstanding due to our cash position.

In October 2005, we contributed $450 million to our U.S. qualified pension trust. We funded
the contribution with a combination of cash on hand and $300 million of commercial paper
borrowings. In November 2005, we sold 24 owned properties in a sale-leaseback transaction for net
cash proceeds of approximately $147.5 million. We used the cash proceeds to repay commercial paper
borrowings. In September of 2006 we received $83.4 million of cash from the sale of our investment
in RSC.

In 2006, we repurchased approximately 12.2 million shares of our common stock of which 0.4
million shares did not settle until October 2006. The total cost of these shares was $743.1
million, of which $20.6 million was recorded in accounts payable at September 30, 2006. We
repurchased 9.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $499.2 million in 2005. We
anticipate repurchasing stock in 2007, the amount of which will depend ultimately on business
conditions, stock price and other cash requirements. At September 30, 2006 we had authorization
from our Board of Directors to purchase up to approximately 5.6 million additional shares through
September 30, 2007.

On
November 7, 2006, we announced that we have entered into a
definitive agreement to divest the principal businesses included in our Power
Systems operating segment for $1.8 billion, comprised of
$1.75 billion in cash and $50 million in common stock of
the acquirer. The divestiture is subject to customary closing
conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to close in our
second fiscal quarter. We expect to use a significant portion of the after-tax cash proceeds
to repurchase common stock, to pay down outstanding commercial paper balances, or to pursue growth opportunities.


We expect future significant uses of cash to include repurchases of common stock, repayments
of short-term borrowings, dividends to shareowners, capital expenditures and acquisitions of
businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans. We expect capital
expenditures in 2007 to be about $175 million. We expect to fund each of these future uses of cash
with existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings,
divestures of businesses, a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities.

In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing
sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our
debt-to-total-capital ratio was 33.5 percent at September 30, 2006 and 31.2 percent at September
30, 2005.

In October 2004, we entered into a five-year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit
facility that replaced our then existing $675.0 million unsecured credit facilities. In September
2006 we entered into a 364-day $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Both credit
facilities remain in effect and we had not drawn down under either of them at September 30, 2006 or
2005. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on short-term money market
rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of these credit
facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio
was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities
at September 30, 2006 and 2005. In addition to our $600.0 million and $250.0 million credit
facilities, short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $125.2 million at September 30,
2006 were available to foreign subsidiaries.

The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2006:

Short Term Rating

Long Term Rating

Outlook

Standard & Poor’s

A-1

Stable

Moody’s

Among other uses, we can draw our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay
our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial
paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been
given to our commercial paper. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect
to limit our other borrowings under the credit facilities, if any, to amounts that would leave
enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of
our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.

If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market
conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the
unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of
borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of
commercial paper borrowings.

Cash dividends to shareowners were $159.3 million ($0.90 per share) in 2006 and $142.7 million
($0.78 per share) in 2005. Although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole
discretion of our Board of Directors, we expect to pay quarterly dividends in 2007 of $0.29 per
outstanding share.

Supplemental Sales Information

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates
effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency rates affect our reported
sales. We believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which is
a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional
performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates.
We use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our
regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating
the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the
preceding year. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies
could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex
judgments by management.


Retirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions
used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan
assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, the retirement rate, the mortality rate and
the employee turnover rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences
between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized
in future periods.

Our global pension expense in 2006 was $83.6 million compared to $66.2 million in 2005.
Approximately 70 percent of our 2006 global pension expense relates to our U.S. qualified pension
plan. The actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2006 U.S. pension expense included the
following: discount rate of 5.25 percent (compared to 6.25 percent for 2005); expected rate of
return on plan assets of 8.50 percent (compared to 8.50 percent for 2005); and an assumed
compensation increase rate of 4.06 percent (compared to 4.50 percent for 2005).

In 2006, we made voluntary contributions of $450.0 million to our primary U.S. qualified
pension plan trust compared to $150.0 million in 2005.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law in August 2006. We are currently
evaluating this legislation and the effect it will have on our future pension contributions.

We estimate our pension expense will be approximately $46 million in 2007, a decrease of
approximately $37 million from 2006. Our estimated 2007 pension expense reflects the net cost
related to changes in actuarial assumptions in the U.S. pension plan and the benefit of the $450.0
million contribution in October 2005.

For 2007, changes in actuarial assumptions include an increase in our discount rate to 6.50
percent from the 5.25 percent rate used in 2006. The discount rate is set as of our June

th

measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the
expected cash flow of our benefit plans. Our assumed rate of return on plan assets will be reduced
to 8.00 percent, compared to the 8.50 percent assumed rate of return used in 2006. We considered
actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan
investments in setting this assumption. We intend, over time, to change the U.S. plan’s mix of
investments by increasing the weighting in debt securities. We have assumed a compensation
increase rate of 4.19 percent in 2007 compared to 4.06 percent used in 2006. We established this
rate using an analysis of all elements of employee compensation that are considered pension
eligible earnings.

The following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic
pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in
millions):

Additional information regarding pension benefits, including our pension obligation and
minimum pension liability adjustment, is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements.

Other Postretirement Benefits

We estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using
assumptions, including the discount rate and, for plans other than our primary U.S. postretirement
healthcare benefit program, expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these
assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of
postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. The discount rate used to calculate
our 2006 other postretirement benefits expense was 5.00 percent (compared to 6.25 percent in 2005).
For 2007, the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will increase to
6.50 percent. The discount rate is set as of our June 30

th

measurement date and was
determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans.


Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit
program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare
services. As a result of this amendment to our primary U.S. program, there is no increase in
healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of January 1, 2005.

Net periodic benefit cost in 2006 was $35.4 million compared to $24.9 million in 2005. We
expect net periodic benefit cost in 2007 of approximately $13 million and the estimated
postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate $255 million. The decreases are due
primarily to the increase in the discount rate by 150 basis points to 6.50 percent and our
transition of all eligible retirees to a more efficient Medicare Advantage Plan.

Additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 12 in the
Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We record sales of products and services, representing approximately 90 percent of our
consolidated sales, when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing
is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and
acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been
rendered.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts
using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of accounting. We record
sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract
method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross
profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and
total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion
method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue
in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are
identified.

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of
sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations
and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based
on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing (OEM)
customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other
incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account
credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain
distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue
recognition based primarily on historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required
if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes
to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the
accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is
recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the
effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $6.0 million.

Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash
or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional
products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance
sheet or, where a right of set-off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The accrual for
customer returns, rebates and incentives was $121.8 million at September 30, 2006 and $117.6
million at September 30, 2005, of which $8.5 million at September 30, 2006 and $9.4 million at
September 30, 2005 was included as an offset to accounts receivable.


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable
through future cash flows. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that
an asset might be impaired. We use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when
an impairment test is necessary. Factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review
include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a
significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner
in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends.

Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds
its estimated fair value. To determine fair value, we must make estimates of the future cash flows
related to the asset being reviewed. These estimates require assumptions about demand for our
products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. Other assumptions
include the discount rate and future growth rates.

We perform our annual impairment test on non-amortized intangible assets during the second
quarter of our fiscal year. As of the second quarter of 2006, the estimated fair value of our
Reliance trademark exceeded its $72.8 million net book value. Either an increase in the
discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of our Electrical business
group could result in an impairment charge to write down the book value of the Reliance trademark
to the revised estimated fair value.

Litigation, Claims and Contingencies

We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable
and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record
liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation
exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly
owned or operated and third-party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible
party. At third-party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified,
we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with
the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent
or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record
a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures
for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability
estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure
or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional
contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is
adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change.

Effective September 30, 2006, we adopted FIN 47, which clarifies the guidance included in SFAS
No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(SFAS 143). Under FIN 47, companies must
accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.

Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation
of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional
asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. The
application of FIN 47 resulted in a charge, net of tax, of $18.1 million included in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2006 as the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle.

Our reserve for environmental matters, net of related receivables, was $66.6 million at
September 30, 2006 and $39.3 million at September 30, 2005. The reserve in 2006 includes $29.3
million recorded in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2006
resulting from our adoption of FIN 47; see Note 17 in the Financial Statements for additional
information. During 2006, we recorded adjustments totaling $5.2 million, excluding the adoption of
FIN 47, to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared to 2005
adjustments of $8.5 million.


Our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses
formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to remediate.
The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that
could result in a significant charge to earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at
legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a long period of
time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation procedures at
existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases
to our environmental obligations.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us
relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability. As
described in Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging
personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our
products many years ago. See Item 3 for further discussion.

Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability where we are self-insured up
to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by
policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the reserve for product liability claims,
excluding asbestos, using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the
product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors
such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. The reserve for product liability claims was
$29.7 million at September 30, 2006 and $29.5 million at September 30, 2005.

Additional information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17
in the Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various
U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have
retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of
businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of
the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the
subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and
interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating
the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may
differ from actual payments or assessments.

While we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns, taxing authorities are
increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional
transactions. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer
price for products, services, and/or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax
matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with
regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and
penalties, if any, according to the principles of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. We
have recorded an accrual of $85.1 million at September 30, 2006 and $103.1 million at September 30,
2005 that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits, which is
included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A final determination of these
tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or
benefit.

We have recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets in the
amount of $36.8 million at September 30, 2006 and $55.5 million at September 30, 2005 related to
non-U.S. net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards (Carryforwards) based on the projected
profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance is based
on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the Carryforward amount will be realized. Our income
would increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more Carryforwards than currently
expected.

At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate a base effective tax rate, which is
the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of
pretax income, permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies. We use this
base rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis, excluding the effect of significant
unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects. We
recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they
are realizable.

Additional information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 in the Financial
Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination
of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of
interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use
a combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest
rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.

Our short-term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At
September 30, 2006, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $219.0 million at a weighted
average interest rate of 5.4 percent; we had no commercial paper or significant bank borrowings
outstanding at September 30, 2005 or during 2005. The weighted average interest rate on the 2006
commercial paper borrowings was 4.8 percent. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper
borrowings affect our results of operations. In 2006 and 2005, a 10 percent increase in average
market interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations.

At September 30, 2006 we had $219.0 million of unsecured commercial paper obligations
outstanding with maturities of three days. As these obligations mature, we issued, and anticipate
continuing to issue, additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of
these borrowings.

We had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with carrying values of $748.2
million at September 30, 2006 and $748.2 million at September 30, 2005. The fair value of this
debt was $804.2 million at September 30, 2006 and $826.2 million at September 30, 2005. The
potential reduction in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10
percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the
debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments and,
therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of
operations or shareowners’ equity.

In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted
our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate
debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 8.02 percent at September 30, 2006. A
hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall
fair value of the swap or our results of operations.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These
risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany
loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our objective
is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and
foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in
currencies other than the applicable functional currency. In addition, we enter into contracts to
hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years.
Contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign
subsidiaries from local currency to United States dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the
underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or
results of operations.

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for
holding them. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted
to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the
hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets,
liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until
the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s
change in fair value in earnings immediately.

At September 30, 2006 and 2005, we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts
primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro, British pound sterling, South Korean won
and Swiss franc. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange
rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange
contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency
exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates
associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of
operations.


The following table indicates the total U.S. dollar equivalents of net transactional foreign
exchange exposure related to (short) long contracts outstanding by currency:

All of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual
transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future. We designated certain of these
contracts related to intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through November 2009 as cash
flow hedges under SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. The
remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of
industrial automation power, control and information products and services.

Basis of Presentation

Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements or the notes
thereto relate to our continuing operations.

In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business. FirstPoint Contact is classified
as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

In June 2006, we announced our intention to divest our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric
motors and motor repair services businesses. These businesses are reflected in continuing
operations for all periods presented as the criteria for discontinued operations prescribed by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, had not been met as of September 30, 2006, the date in which this
standard requires the criteria to be assessed. On
November 7, 2006, we announced that we have entered into a
definitive agreement to sell these businesses to Baldor Electric
Company (Baldor) for $1.8 billion, comprised of $1.75 billion in
cash and $50 million in Baldor common stock. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory
approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of our fiscal
2007.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned and controlled majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we have
the ability to exert significant influence, but that we do not control and are not the primary
beneficiary of, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our
proportional share of the respective affiliate’s earnings or losses is included in other income
(expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Investments in affiliates over which we do
not have the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of
accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the aggregate to our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items,
customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete
inventory; impairment of long-lived assets; product warranty obligations; retirement benefits;
litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters and conditional asset
retirement obligations; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions
prospectively when warranted by factually based experience.

Revenue Recognition

We record sales of products and services, representing approximately 90 percent of our
consolidated sales, when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing
is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and
acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been
rendered.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts
using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of accounting. We record
sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract
method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross
profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and
total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion
method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue
in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are
identified.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

1.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies — (Continued)

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of
sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations
and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs
are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based
on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other
incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account
credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain
distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue
recognition based primarily on historical experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are
recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and
incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided.
Amounts are accrued at the time of recognition of our sale to a distributor or direct sale
customer. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of
set-off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable.

Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions

Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales,
value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenue).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of deposit with original
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Receivables

We record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general
matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are
stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $15.2 million at September 30, 2006 and $18.4
million at September 30, 2005. In addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain
customer returns, rebates and incentives of $8.5 million at September 30, 2006 and $9.4 million at
September 30, 2005.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or
average cost methods. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.

Property

Property is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line
method over 15 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 14 years for machinery and
equipment and 3 to 10 years for computer hardware and software. We capitalize significant renewals
and enhancements and write off replaced units. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as
renewals of minor amounts.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account
for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values, the excess of the purchase price over the
allocated amount is recorded as goodwill.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

1.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,

requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to be reviewed
for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment may be
present, rather than amortized as previous standards required. Any excess in carrying value over
the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We perform an annual impairment test
during the second quarter of our fiscal year.

We amortize intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years for distributor networks, 3 to 10
years for computer software products, 6 to 14 years for patents and 3 to 14 years for other
intangible assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived
from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we
measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset
exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or
fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow
analysis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange
contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We
use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash
flows associated with intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years (cash
flow hedges) and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from
intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We
sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.
Our accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such
instruments as hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is
our policy to execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts
are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States
with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the
end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates
effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a
component of other comprehensive income. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
results of operations in the period incurred.

Research and Development Expenses

We expense research and development (R&D) costs as incurred; these costs were $160.4 million
in 2006, $138.6 million in 2005 and $121.7 million in 2004. We include R&D expenses in cost of
sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We record a liability for income tax exposures when they are probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Tax benefits related to claims are also recognized when they become probable
and reasonably estimable. When determining the probability and the estimability of the liability
or tax benefit, we consider the relevant tax law as applied to us by the particular country, state,
or other taxing authority.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Earnings Per Share

We present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of
outstanding share-based compensation awards. Share-based compensation awards for which the total
employee proceeds exceed the average market price over the period have an antidilutive effect on
EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation
awards for the years ended September 30, 2006 (905,455 shares), 2005 (20,013 shares) and 2004
(51,938 shares) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

The following table reconciles basic weighted average outstanding shares to diluted weighted
average outstanding shares (in millions):

Share-Based Compensation

Effective October 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)), using
the modified prospective application transition method. We recognize share-based compensation
expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the service
period of each award recipient. See Note 11 for additional information. SFAS 123(R) requires us
to report the tax benefit from the tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in
excess of recognized compensation costs (excess tax benefits) as a financing cash flow rather than
as an operating cash flow. Prior to 2006 and the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we reported the entire
tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow.

Product and Workers’ Compensation Liabilities

We record accruals for product and workers’ compensation claims in the period in which they
are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product
liability and workers’ compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims
exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial
insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims
experience for the periods being valued.

Environmental Matters

We record accruals for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is
probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods
in which the estimated costs of remediation change. At environmental sites for which more than one
potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated
allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental
sites for which we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated
costs of remediation. We do not discount to their present value future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third
parties is probable, we record a receivable for the estimated recovery.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We account for conditional asset retirement obligations under Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

(FIN
47). We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. See Note 17 for additional
information related to these obligations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R

(SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other
postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in
the funded status in the year the changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan
assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers’ fiscal year. SFAS 158 is effective
for us at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the change in measurement date, which is effective for
us in fiscal 2008. The effect on our financial statements is dependent upon the discount rate at
our fiscal 2007 measurement date (June 30, 2007) and actual returns on our pension plan assets
during the year. We expect the statement to result in a reduction of our shareowners’ equity. It
is unlikely that FAS 158 will affect our loan covenant compliance or our other financial
arrangements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information
used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability. SFAS 157 will be effective for
us beginning in fiscal 2008. We are evaluating the statement to determine the effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures.

In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 108,

Financial Statements — Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to
quantify the impact of all correcting misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing
effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements. This pronouncement
is effective for us in fiscal 2007. We do not believe SAB 108 will have a material effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes

(FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and retirement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN
48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 will be effective for us beginning in fiscal
2008. We are evaluating the interpretation to determine the effect on our financial statements and
related disclosures.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

2006 Acquisitions and Divestitures

In May 2006, our Control Systems segment acquired GEPA mbH, a provider of change management
software for industrial automation, process control and industrial information technology. In
January 2006, our Control Systems segment acquired Caribbean Integration Engineers, Inc. (CIE). CIE
offers engineering services in control systems integration, process automation, computer system
validation and IT solutions. Our Control Systems segment also acquired Datasweep, Inc., a provider
of production management software, in December 2005.

The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations since the dates of acquisition. Pro forma financial information and
allocation of the purchase price is not presented as the effects of these acquisitions are not
material to our results of operations and financial position.

In March 2006, our Control Systems segment sold the assets of our ElectroCraft Engineered
Solutions business. Discontinued operations related to this sale are not presented as the effect of
this divestiture was not material to our results of operations and financial position.

We also sold our investment in Rockwell Scientific Company LLC (RSC) during 2006. See Note 14
for additional information related to this sale.

2005 Acquisitions

On September 1, 2005, our Power Systems segment acquired the assets of Quality Rewind &
Electric, Inc.’s motor repair and management business (Quality Rewind) based in Ft. McMurray,
Alberta, Canada.

During 2006, in connection with the final purchase price allocations of Quality Rewind,
Datasweep, Inc. and CIE (see Note 2), we recorded intangible assets of $21.7 million, of which $9.0
million was assigned to computer software products and $1.9 million to intangible assets not
subject to amortization. The remainder is classified as other intangible assets. Our preliminary
purchase price allocation associated with our acquisition of GEPA mbH includes an allocation of
$1.8 million to computer software products and $1.2 million to other intangible assets.

Computer software products amortization expense was $16.4 million in 2006, $14.8 million in
2005 and $16.0 million in 2004.

We issued an aggregate of $800 million principal amount of our 6.15% notes, 6.70% debentures
and 5.20% debentures in January 1998. The debt offering yielded approximately $750.0 million of
proceeds. We issued the 5.20% debentures at a discount, and the 6.15% notes and 6.70% debentures
at par.

In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract (the Swap) that effectively
converted our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to
floating rate debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 8.02 percent at September 30,
2006 and 6.23 percent at September 30, 2005. As permitted by SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133), as amended, we have designated the Swap
as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair value of the Swap was recorded in other liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the
underlying debt at September 30, 2006 and 2005. The fair value of the Swap, based upon quoted
market prices for contracts with similar maturities, was a liability of $6.8 million at September
30, 2006 and a liability of $6.3 million at September 30, 2005.

On October 26, 2004, we entered into a five-year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit
facility. On September 29, 2006, we entered into a 364-day $250.0 million unsecured revolving
credit facility. Both credit facilities remain in effect and we have not drawn down under either
of them at September 30, 2006 or 2005. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based
on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The
terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our
debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants
under these credit facilities at September 30, 2006 and 2005. In addition to our $600.0 and $250.0
million credit facilities, short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $125.2 million
at September 30, 2006 were available to foreign subsidiaries. There were no significant commitment
fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities. Borrowings under our
credit facilities during 2006 were not significant.

Interest payments were $60.4 million during 2006, $45.6 million during 2005 and $40.9 million
during 2004.

We base the fair value of long-term debt upon quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues. We base the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on quoted market
prices for contracts with similar maturities.

Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign
currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At September 30, 2006 and 2005,
we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts
relating to the euro, British pound sterling, South Korean won and Swiss franc. The foreign
currency forward exchange contracts are recorded in other current assets in the amounts of $1.9
million as of September 30, 2006 and $22.2 million as of September 30, 2005 and other current
liabilities in the amounts of $8.5 million as of September 30, 2006 and $4.0 million as of
September 30, 2005. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial position relating to these foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We have
designated certain foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to forecasted intercompany
transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the
ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was not significant.

We also hold financial instruments consisting of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and short-term debt. The carrying value of these assets and liabilities as reported in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value.

Shareowners’ Equity

Common Stock

At September 30, 2006, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of one billion shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and 25 million shares of preferred stock, without par
value. At September 30, 2006, 17.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for various
incentive plans.

During September 2006, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of common stock for $20.6
million that did not settle until October 2006. These outstanding purchases were recorded in
accounts payable at September 30, 2006.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights

Each outstanding share of common stock provides the holder with one Preferred Share Purchase
Right (Right). The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group, without the approval
of the board of directors, acquires, or offers to acquire, 20 percent or more of the common stock,
although the board of directors is authorized to reduce the 20 percent threshold for triggering the
Rights to not less than 10 percent. Upon exercise, each Right entitles the holder to 1/100th of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company (Junior Preferred Stock) at a
price of $250, subject to adjustment.

Upon an acquisition of the Company, each Right (other than Rights held by the acquirer) will
generally be exercisable for $500 worth of either common stock of the Company or common stock of
the acquirer for $250. In certain circumstances, each Right may be exchanged by the Company for
one share of common stock or 1/100th of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. The Rights will expire
on December 6, 2006.

Approximately $1.3 million ($0.8 million after tax) of the net unrealized losses on cash flow
hedges as of September 30, 2006 will be reclassified into earnings during 2007. We expect that
these unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings.

Share-Based Compensation

Effective October 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application
transition method. Before we adopted SFAS 123(R), we accounted for share-based compensation in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.

Other than for restricted stock, no share-based employee compensation cost was reflected
in net income before October 1, 2005. SFAS 123(R) requires us to report the tax benefit from the
tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in excess of recognized compensation
costs (excess tax benefits) as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. Before
October 1, 2005 we reported the entire tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options as an
operating cash flow.

During 2006, we recognized $29.5 million in share-based compensation expense. The total
income tax benefit recognized related to share-based compensation during 2006 was $10.3 million.
We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line
basis over the service period of each award recipient. As of September 30, 2006, total
unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $30.6 million, net of
estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately
1.3 years.

Our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 24 million
shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, or upon grant or in payment of stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units and restricted stock. Our 2003 Directors
Stock Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 0.5 million shares of our common stock upon
exercise of stock options or upon grant of shares of our common and restricted stock.
Approximately 5.9 million shares under our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan and 0.4 million shares
under our 2003 Directors Stock Plan remain available for future grant or payment at September 30,
2006. We use treasury stock to deliver shares of our common stock under these plans. Our 2000
Long-Term Incentives Plan does not permit share-based compensation awards to be granted after
November 30, 2009.

Stock Options

We have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under
various incentive plans at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates.
The exercise price for some options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, shares of common
stock or a combination of cash and shares. Stock options expire ten years after the grant date and
vest ratably over three years.

The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $17.67, $12.60 and $7.20, respectively. We estimated the
fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the
following assumptions:

The average risk-free interest rate is based on the five-year U.S. treasury security rate in
effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend
as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined
expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility (90 percent) of our
stock price over the past four years (the period since our spinoff of Rockwell Collins, Inc.) and
implied volatility (10 percent) based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We
determined that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future
market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility. We
determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated
exercise dates of unexercised options.

Performance Share Awards

Certain officers and key employees are also eligible to receive shares of our common stock in
payment of performance share awards granted to them. During 2006, 143,100 performance share awards
were granted (for which up to 286,200 shares of our common stock could be delivered in payment).
Grantees of performance shares will be eligible to receive shares of our common stock depending
upon our total shareowner return, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to the
performance of the S&P 500 over a three-year period. No performance share awards were outstanding
as of September 30, 2005. At September 30, 2006, 140,500 performance shares were outstanding.

The per share fair value of performance shares granted during the year ended September 30,

as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined
expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility (90 percent) of our

implied volatility (10 percent) based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We
determined that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future
market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility. We
determined the average S&P 500 expected volatility using
daily historical volatility for the period from January 2002 through
December 2004.

Restricted Stock

We also grant restricted stock awards to certain employees. Restrictions lapse over periods
ranging from three to five years. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of

Share-Based Compensation — (Continued)

Pro forma net income for 2005 includes an additional $4.9 million after tax of compensation
expense, recognized in the second quarter of 2005, for retirement eligible stock option
participants. Previously we reported compensation expense for these participants over the vesting
period. Stock options granted to retirement eligible plan participants who retire under our
retirement plans on or after the first anniversary of the grant date continue to vest
post-retirement in accordance with plan provisions and agreements related thereto. If the plan
participant retires less than twelve months from the grant date, the options under that grant are
forfeited. Stock compensation expense on grants to plan participants who are retirement eligible
on the grant date or who will be retirement eligible in less than twelve months from the grant date
is reported in pro forma net income over the twelve month period from the grant date. We report
stock compensation expense on grants to plan participants who become retirement eligible between
twelve and thirty-six months after the grant date in pro forma net income over the period from
grant date to the retirement eligibility date.

Pro forma net income for 2004 includes $3.6 million after tax of expense related to
performance-vesting options that vested in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the market
price on our common stock reaching a specified level for a pre-determined period of time. Net
income, as reported and pro forma net income in 2004 include $2.9 million (before and after tax) of
compensation expense resulting from modifications made to certain stock options in connection with
the sale of our FirstPoint Contact business.

Retirement Benefits

We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our
employees. The pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly pension payments
to eligible employees after retirement. Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are
based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are
primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to
funding our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required by applicable laws and
governmental regulations. We may, however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the
minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in 2006 and 2005. Other postretirement
benefits are primarily in the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our United States
employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible employees and dependents
after retirement.

periodic benefit cost for us. Also in 2004, we recognized a pension curtailment loss of $0.4
million and an other postretirement benefits curtailment gain of $2.3 million related to the sale
of our FirstPoint Contact business that is reflected in Income from discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

During 2006, we recorded a decrease to our minimum pension liability of $656.1 million
resulting primarily from the discount rate change and the $450.0 million contribution to our U.S.
qualified pension plan in 2006. The decrease of our minimum pension liability and related deferred
tax asset resulted in a net increase to shareowners’ equity (reflected as a decrease in accumulated
other comprehensive loss) of $401.3 million.

In 2005, we amended our U.S. pension plan effective for 2006 to eliminate the early retirement
subsidy for certain employees. The effect of the amendment is a reduction in the pension
obligation of approximately $70 million recognized in 2005 and a corresponding reduction in annual
pension expense recognized over the average remaining service life of plan participants.

In 2006, we made voluntary contributions of $450.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan
trust. In 2005, we contributed $150.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust.

The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans is $2,164.4 million as of the 2006
measurement date and $2,357.1 million as of the 2005 measurement date.

We use an actuarial measurement date of June 30 to measure our benefit obligations, plan
assets and to calculate our net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement
benefits.

Retirement Benefits — (Continued)

Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our United States postretirement healthcare benefit
program in order to mitigate the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services. Effective
January 1, 2004, we began contributing 50 percent of the amount in excess of the 2003 per capita
amount. However, our calendar 2004 contribution was limited to a 7.5 percent increase from the
2003 per capita amount. Effective January 1, 2005, we limit our future per capita maximum
contribution to our calendar 2004 per capita contribution.

As a result of the finalization during 2005 of the rules for the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act), we have included an additional reduction in
our accumulated projected benefit obligation of $13.5 million as of September 30, 2005, which is
being amortized to expense over the average remaining service life.

In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we equally consider
the historical performance and the future expected performance for returns for each asset category,
as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolios. This resulted in the selection
of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global weighted-average
asset allocations at September 30, by asset category, are:

The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the
plan’s benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We
strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and
diversification within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted
periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by
rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager
performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager.

As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, our pension plans do not own our common stock.

In certain non-U.S. countries in which we operate, there are no legal requirements or
financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we
typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a
separate pension fund.

Estimated Future Payments

We expect to contribute approximately $50.0 million related to our worldwide pension plans and
$23.9 million to our postretirement benefit plans in 2007.

The following benefit payments, which include employees’ expected future service, as
applicable, are expected to be paid (in millions):

FirstPoint Contact

In 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business for cash proceeds and a note convertible into
a minority interest in the corporate parent of the buyer. The value assigned to the convertible
note on the date of the transaction was approximately $27.0 million. In September 2005, the note
was converted to non-voting equity shares, accounted for under the cost method. The historical cost
value of $27.0 million was used to value the equity shares at the date of conversion. In July 2006
we received a cash dividend of $25.5 million in respect of the equity shares resulting from a
recapitalization and distribution of cash to shareholders and management. We recorded dividend
income of $1.4 million and the remaining $24.1 million as a return of capital. Our value of the
equity shares recorded at September 30, 2006 is $2.9 million. No fair value is available for this
investment as the equity shares are not publicly traded. Accordingly, it is not practicable to
estimate fair value.

The results of operations of FirstPoint Contact for 2004, as well as the gain on the sale, are

Related Party Transactions

In September 2006, we and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell Collins) sold our investment in
RSC for an aggregate of $167.5 million in cash. Prior to the date of sale, we and Rockwell
Collins each owned 50 percent of RSC. As part of the transaction, among other things, we retained
certain licenses for intellectual property owned by RSC. Additionally, we incurred expenses and
funded certain RSC cash balances in connection with the sale and are obligated to pay to RSC $2.8
million in 2007 and $1.2 million in 2009. We recorded a gain on sale of $19.9 million ($12.0
million after tax, or $0.07 per share).

We have an agreement with RSC pursuant to which RSC performs research and development services
for us, expiring on September 30, 2009. We incurred $2.3 million in 2006, $2.8 million in 2005 and
$3.7 million in 2004 for research and development services performed by RSC. At September 30, 2006
and 2005, the amounts due to or from RSC were not significant.

During 2006, we sold a portion of our ownership interest in CoLinx, LLC (CoLinx), a company
that provides logistics and e-commerce services, resulting in a gain of $0.8 million, and reducing
our ownership interest from 25 percent to 20 percent. We account for this ownership interest using
the equity method. We paid CoLinx $21.6 million in 2006, $18.2 million in 2005 and $17.1 million
in 2004, primarily for logistics services. In addition, CoLinx paid us approximately $3.8 million
in 2006, $2.8 million in 2005 and $2.2 million in 2004 for the use of facilities we own and other
services. The amounts due to and from CoLinx at September 30, 2006 and 2005 were not significant.

We have a valuation allowance at September 30, 2006 as noted above for carryforwards
for which future use is less than more likely than not.

During 2006, the valuation allowance increased by $7.0 million as a result of audit
settlements and decreased by $27.2 million as a result of the planned utilization of capital loss
carryforwards related to the sale of our investment in RSC and our planned sale of our Dodge
mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses.

During 2005, the valuation allowance decreased by $7.5 million as a result of a basis
adjustment in connection with the filing of the 2004 income tax return related to the sale of
FirstPoint Contact and the recording of a valuation allowance for non-U.S. net operating losses.

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various
U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have
retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of
businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of
the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the
subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and
interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating
the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may
differ from actual payments or assessments.

Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for
products, services, and/or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise
our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with regard to tax
exposures and record liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and
penalties, if any, according to the principles of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. We
have recorded an accrual of $85.1 million and $103.1 million at September 30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits. The
accrual is recorded in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net change in the
accrual of $18.0 million reflects a reduction of $18.3 million related to the settlement
of the 2003 — 2004 U.S. federal audit and various state audits,
a net $13.3 million reduction due to changes in estimates related
to current year audit developments, and a $13.6 million increase
primarily related to current year taxes and interest on previously
identified income tax exposures. A final determination
of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense
or benefit.

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates that
have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and at September 30,
2006, were approximately $746.0 million. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits,
it is not practicable to determine the U.S. or state income tax liabilities that would be payable
if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for non-U.S.
affiliates when we plan to remit those earnings.

Income taxes paid were $214.7 million during 2006, $134.8 million during 2005 and $30.0
million during 2004.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Environmental Matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the
environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have
and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without
material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition.

We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at 14 Superfund sites, excluding
sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has
been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible
costs we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at September 30, 2006 to be $10.4
million, of which $3.3 million has been accrued.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us alleging
violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements, or seeking
remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As
of September 30, 2006, we have estimated the total reasonably possible costs we could incur from
these matters to be $78.7 million. We have recorded environmental accruals for these matters of
$32.9 million. In addition to the above matters, we assumed certain other environmental
liabilities in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance. We are indemnified by ExxonMobil
Corporation (Exxon) for substantially all costs associated with these matters. The indemnity
applies to liabilities for which we give Exxon notice by December 29, 2006. At September 30, 2006,
we have recorded a liability of $22.4 million and a receivable of $21.3 million for these matters.
We estimate the total reasonably possible costs for these matters to be $27.0 million for which we
are substantially indemnified by Exxon.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities — (Continued)

Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment
and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and
other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We
cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective September 30, 2006, we adopted FIN 47, which clarifies the guidance included in SFAS
No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(SFAS 143). Under FIN 47, companies must
accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.

Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation
of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional
asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. The
application of FIN 47 resulted in a charge, net of tax, of $18.1 million included in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2006 as the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle. The liability for conditional asset retirement obligations
recognized at September 30, 2006 as the result of the application of FIN 47 was $29.3 million and
is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Pro forma amounts, as if FIN 47 had been applied for all periods, are (dollars in millions,

varying periods, and certain leases include options to purchase the leased property.

Lease Commitments — (Continued)

During 2006, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction of 24 properties, including the land,
buildings and improvements affixed to the properties. The lease terms vary from five to fifteen
years depending on the property and are classified as operating leases. The net proceeds on sale
were approximately $147.5 million. Three of the sold properties resulted in a loss of $1.8 million
that we recognized during 2006, with the remaining properties resulting in a gain on sale of $36.9
million that will be amortized to rent expense over the term of the respective leases. The net
book value of the sold assets have been removed from our balance sheet, except for three properties
where we have retained a right to re-acquire a subdivided portion of adjacent vacant land. For
these properties, we will remove the assets from our balance sheet upon re-conveyance of the vacant
land or termination of our right. The net proceeds related to these three properties of $18.6
million are reported in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During 2004, we sold a facility in a sale-leaseback transaction with a third party resulting
in a $20.6 million pre-tax loss. The net cash proceeds from the sale were $19.0 million.

Other Matters

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us
relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, safety
and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been
asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal
injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many
years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants,
together with hundreds of other companies. The great bulk of the complaints, however, do not
identify any of our products or specify which of these claimants, if any, were exposed to asbestos
attributable to our products; and past experience has shown that the vast majority of the claimants
will never identify any of our products. In addition, when our products appear to be identified,
they are frequently from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. For
those claimants who do show that they worked with our products, we nevertheless believe we have
meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of our products, the encapsulated
nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on
the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been
dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over
and above self-insured retentions, for most of these claims. We initiated litigation in the
Milwaukee County Circuit Court on February 12, 2004 to enforce the insurance policies against
Nationwide Indemnity Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that provided insurance
coverage to our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. As a result, the insurance carriers have paid
some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed to pay the substantial majority of future
defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims, subject to policy limits. If either
carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits of either carrier are exhausted, our share of future
defense and indemnity costs may increase. However, coverage under excess policies may be available
to pay some or all of these costs.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

17.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities — (Continued)

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term solvency of our insurance
companies make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That
uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting
asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on
our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition.

In connection with the divestiture of our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D
Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing), we agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters related
to operations of the A&D Business for periods prior to the divestiture. In connection with the
spinoffs of our former automotive component systems business, semiconductor systems business and
Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the respective businesses,
including environmental and intellectual property matters.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with such
divestitures, lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to
the period that we owned the businesses.

In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms
and conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in
other contracts with third parties, such as contracts concerning: the development and manufacture
of our products; the divestiture of businesses; and the licensing of intellectual property. Due to
the number of agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate the maximum
potential future payments. However, we believe that future payments, if any, would not be material
to our business or financial condition.

In 2007 we plan to execute on certain cost productivity initiatives. These initiatives will
likely include workforce reductions and facility rationalization. These actions are consistent
with the planned divestiture of most of our Power Systems operating segment and our globalization
and cost productivity efforts. Costs associated with these actions will be recorded when the
relevant recognition criteria have been met.

Business Segment Information

Rockwell Automation is a provider of industrial automation power, control and information
products and services. We are organized based upon products and services and have two operating
segments: Control Systems and Power Systems.

Control Systems

The Control Systems operating segment supplies industrial automation products, systems,
software and services focused on helping customers control and improve manufacturing processes.
Control Systems includes two main business groups: the Components and Packaged Applications Group
(CPAG) and the Automation Control and Information Group (ACIG).

CPAG supplies industrial components, power control and motor management products, and packaged
and engineered products and systems. It supplies motor starters, contactors, push buttons,
signaling devices, termination and protection devices, relays and timers, condition sensors,
adjustable speed drives, motor control centers and drive systems. CPAG’s sales account for
approximately 39 percent of Control Systems’ sales.

ACIG’s core products are used primarily to control and monitor industrial plants and processes
and typically consist of a processor, software and input/output (I/O) devices. ACIG’s integrated
architecture and Logix controllers perform multiple types of control applications, including
discrete, batch, continuous process, drive system, motion and machine safety across various factory
floor operations. ACIG’s products include controllers, control platforms, software, I/O devices,
high performance rotary and linear motion control systems, electronic operator interface devices,
sensors, industrial computers and machine safety components. ACIG’s sales account for
approximately 45 percent of Control Systems’ sales.

In addition, Control Systems’ offerings also include services and solutions, such as
multi-vendor customer support, training, automation systems integration, asset management, and
manufacturing information solutions for discrete and targeted batch process industries.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Business Segment Information — (Continued)

Effective October 1, 2006, we have realigned our internal management reporting structure. The
reporting structure changes include realignment of our Control Systems’ services and solutions
offerings to report through the Components and Packaged Applications Group (CPAG) business group.
Additionally, the Power Systems drives and drives related parts and services business has been
realigned to also report through the CPAG business group. As a result of changes in the internal
management reporting structure, we will begin reporting the historical Control Systems operating
segment as two separate operating segments in our first quarter of 2007.

Power Systems

The Power Systems operating segment consists of two business groups: Dodge mechanical
(Mechanical) and Reliance electrical (Electrical).

Mechanical’s products include mounted bearings, gear reducers, mechanical drives, conveyor
pulleys, couplings, bushings, clutches and motor brakes. Electrical’s products include industrial
and engineered motors, adjustable speed drives, product repair, motor and mechanical maintenance
solutions, training and consulting services to OEM’s, end-users and distributors.

Among other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based upon segment
operating earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices,
certain non-recurring corporate initiatives, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses,
earnings and losses from equity affiliates that are not considered part of the operations of a
particular segment and incremental acquisition related expenses resulting from purchase accounting
adjustments such as intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory and purchased research
and development charges. Depending on the product, intersegment sales are either at a market price
or cost plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market price. In preparing the
segment information, we use accounting policies consistent with those described in Note 1.

administrative functions and a reduction of workforce in Europe in our Control Systems
segment and a facility closure in our Power Systems segment. Segment operating earnings of
Control Systems and Power Systems include these special charges of $16.5 million and $5.0
million, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. The special charges are
included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2005
in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the amounts of $9.4
million and $12.1 million, respectively. Total cash expenditures (after-tax) in connection
with these actions were approximately $11.4 million related to employee severance and
separation costs. Non-cash charges of $2.8 million after-tax relate to a write-down of
property to its fair value, determined by management using customary valuation techniques.

Subsequent Events

In June 2006, we announced our intention to divest our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric
motors and motor repair services businesses. These are the principal businesses of our Power
Systems operating segment. From the date of our announcement through
our fiscal year end, we have received expressions of interest from potential buyers, conducted management
presentations and responded to buyer due diligence activities.
Subsequent to our fiscal year end we have received bids from
prospective buyers and completed contract negotiations. On
November 7, 2006, we announced that we have entered into a
definitive agreement to sell these businesses to Baldor Electric
Company for $1.8 billion, comprised of $1.75 billion in
cash and $50 million in Baldor common stock. We expect to
recognize a gain from the transaction. The transaction’s effective tax
rate will be lower than our statutory tax rate. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory
approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of our fiscal
2007.

In
subsequent filings these businesses will be
reported as discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareowners’ equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 2006 and
2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 1, 2005, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R,

Shared Based Payments

. As described
in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on September 30, 2006, the Company adopted
FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated November 9, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness, as of September
30, 2006, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September 30, 2006.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon that evaluation, management
has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30,
2006.

Our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included on the following page.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended September 30, 2006 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

In 2005, we began planning to develop common global process standards and an enterprise-wide
information technology system. During 2006, we began the implementation phase, which included a
pilot roll-out to one of our small manufacturing locations. Additional roll-outs will occur to
most locations of our company over a multi-year period, with the next phase scheduled for fiscal
2007. As the phased roll-out occurs, we will experience changes in internal control over financial
reporting each quarter. No significant changes occurred during the year ended September 30, 2006
related to this program.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of the changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our
opinion, Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of
and for the year ended September 30, 2006 of the Company and our
report dated November 9, 2006,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and
included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company’s adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 123R,

Shared Based Payments

and of FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
