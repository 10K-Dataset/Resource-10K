Item 1.

Business

General

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses. The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985. Our products and services are designed to meet our customers’ needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce manufacturing business risk.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC. RIC was incorporated in 1928.

As used herein, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Rockwell Automation” include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. These risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process uses the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to assess, manage, and monitor risks. We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy. Our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on the Company only to a limited extent.

A team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and reviews significant identified risks. The Audit Committee also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. Our other Board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.

Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. However, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our revenues and profitability.

We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.

Demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve. As economic activity slows, credit markets tighten, or sovereign debt concerns linger, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, which could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our ability to access the credit markets, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions. If our access to credit, including the commercial paper market, is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise, our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced.

We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries.

Approximately

51 percent

of our revenues in


were made outside of the U.S. Future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on growth in our international sales. Numerous risks and uncertainties affect our international operations. These risks and uncertainties include increased financial, legal and operating risks, such as political and economic instability, compliance with existing and future laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, investments, taxation, trade controls, employment regulations, repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. In addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates.

New legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business.

Legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business. For example, we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material, product, certification, labeling and customer requirements. These requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions.



An inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new products requires high levels of innovation, and the development process is often lengthy and costly. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences, demand for our products could decline.

Failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business.

We rely heavily on information technology (IT) both in our products, solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise IT infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. Government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers, cyber-criminals and other attacks targeting every type of IT system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise IT systems.

Our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs. These attacks have sometimes been successful.

Despite the precautions we take, an intrusion or infection of software, hardware or a system that we sold or serviced could result in the disruption of our customers’ business, loss of proprietary or confidential information, or injuries to people or property. Similarly, an attack on our enterprise IT system could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information. Any such events could have an adverse impact on revenue, harm our reputation, cause us to incur legal liability and cause us to incur increased costs to address such events and related security concerns.

We are implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that is resulting in redesigned processes, organization structures and a common information system. Significant roll-outs of the system occurred at our U.S. locations and certain non-U.S. locations in 2007 to


, and are scheduled to continue at additional locations in


and beyond. As we continue to implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. This could have an adverse effect on our business.

There are inherent risks in our solutions businesses.

Risks inherent in the sale of solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success, defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing projects, and managing the quality of our subcontractors and suppliers. If we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our industry is highly competitive.

We face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects. We compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings, technology differentiation, product performance, quality of our products and services, knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges, pricing, delivery and customer service. The relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve. We seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems. If we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services, we may experience price erosion, lower revenues and margins. We expect the level of competition to remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.

We face the potential harms of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.

Natural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create economic instability. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products.



Intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.

Others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. We frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. Indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costly.

In addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business. The inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant.

We must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position.

We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims by taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.

Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel while appropriately managing costs related to employee benefits.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. One important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits.

The amount of expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans depends on factors such as changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets. Significant decreases in market interest rates or the value of plan assets would increase our expenses. Expenses related to employer-funded health care benefits continue to increase as well.

Increasing employee benefit costs or the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims and environmental remediation) could reduce our profitability.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products, services and solutions we sell, employment, contract matters and environmental remediation.

We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago. Our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities, which could result in product liability claims. The uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution.

Our operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health, the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground and waters, the quality of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change. Our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals, as well as properties that we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. We have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.



A disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our revenues.

In the United States and Canada, approximately

90 percent

of our sales are through distributors. In certain other countries, the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors. While we maintain the right to appoint new distributors, any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our revenues. A disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of a distributor, or other events.

We rely on vendors to supply equipment and components, which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business.

Our business requires that we buy equipment and components, including finished products, which may include computer chips and commodities such as copper, aluminum and steel. Our reliance on suppliers of these items involves certain risks, including:

•

poor quality can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our products;

•

the cost of these purchases may change due to inflation, exchange rates, commodity market volatility or other factors;

•

we may not be able to recover any increase in costs for these purchases through price increases to our customers; and

•

a shortage of components, commodities or other materials could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery.

Any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete. We also maintain several single-source supplier relationships, because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products. Even where substitute sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues.

Our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives.

Our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities. Localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities, including supply chain and sourcing activities, product design, manufacturing, engineering, marketing and sales and support. These activities expose us to risks, including those related to political and economic uncertainties, transportation delays, labor market disruptions, and challenges to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we continue to invest in initiatives to reduce our cost structure. The failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us.

We have acquired, and will continue to acquire, businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including:

•

difficulties in integrating the acquired business, retaining the acquired business’ customers, and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as revenue increases, access to technologies, cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired time frames;

•

loss of key employees of the acquired business;

•

difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and

•

diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.

Future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.

There are no major encumbrances (other than financing arrangements, which in the aggregate are not significant) on any of our plants or equipment. In our opinion, our properties have been well maintained, are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

McGregor, Texas NWIRP Facility Environmental Claim.

RIC operated the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) in McGregor, Texas from 1958 through 1978 for the United States Navy. Incident to Boeing’s acquisition of RIC in 1996, we agreed to indemnify RIC and Boeing for any liability arising out of RIC’s activities at the NWIRP to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the U.S. government.

On December 3, 2007, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) notified RIC that the United States Navy was seeking to recover environmental cleanup costs incurred at the NWIRP. The DOJ asserted that it has incurred more than $50 million (excluding interest, attorneys’ fees and other indirect costs) in environmental cleanup costs at the NWIRP, and it believes that it may have a potential cause of action against RIC and other former contractors at the NWIRP for recovery of those costs. In June 2011, RIC and one other former contractor at the NWIRP reached a settlement with the DOJ and the United States Navy to resolve all claims in exchange for payment of $14 million. RIC will be responsible for half of the settlement amount. The parties negotiated the terms of a Consent Decree that was reviewed and approved by the DOJ. The Consent Decree was submitted to the District Court for approval, and was approved on September 30, 2012 thereby completely resolving this claim.

Asbestos.

We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. Currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. In some cases, the claims involve products from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us, which occurred on January 31, 2007. We also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against RIC’s divested measurement and flow control business. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising from our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. Following litigation against Nationwide Indemnity Company (Nationwide) and Kemper Insurance (Kemper), the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to Allen-Bradley, we entered into separate agreements on April 1, 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. In exchange for a lump sum payment, Kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to Allen-Bradley. Nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. We believe this arrangement will continue to provide coverage for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability.

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Other.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Overview

We are a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses. Overall demand for our products and services is driven by:

•

investments in manufacturing, including upgrades, modifications and expansions of existing facilities or production lines, and the creation of new facilities or production lines;

•

our customers’ needs for productivity and cost reduction, sustainable production (cleaner, safer and more energy efficient), quality assurance and overall global competitiveness;

•

industry factors that include our customers’ new product introductions, demand for our customers’ products or services, and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate;

•

levels of global industrial production and capacity utilization;

•

regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic circumstances;

•

the seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedule; and

•

investments in basic materials production capacity, partly in response to higher commodity pricing.

Long-term Strategy

Our vision of being the most valued global provider of innovative industrial automation and information products, services and solutions is supported by our growth and performance strategy, which seeks to:

•

achieve growth rates in excess of the automation market by expanding our served market and strengthening our competitive differentiation;

•

diversify our revenue streams by increasing our capabilities in new applications, broadening our solutions and service capabilities, advancing our global presence and serving a wider range of industries;

•

grow market share by gaining new customers and by capturing a larger share of existing customers’ spending;

•

enhance our market access by building our channel capability and partner network;

•

make acquisitions that serve as catalysts to organic growth by adding complementary technology, expanding our served market, increasing our domain expertise or continuing our geographic diversification;

•

deploy human and financial resources to strengthen our technology leadership and our intellectual capital business model; and

•

continuously improve quality and customer experience and drive annual cost productivity.

By implementing the strategy above, we seek to achieve our long-term financial goals that include revenue growth of 6-8 percent, double-digit EPS growth, return on invested capital in excess of 20 percent, free cash flow of about 100 percent of net income and 60 percent of our revenue outside the U.S, including 30 percent of revenue from emerging markets.

Our customers face the challenge of remaining globally cost competitive and automation can help them achieve their productivity and sustainability objectives. Our value proposition is to help our customers reduce time to market, lower total cost of ownership, improve asset utilization and manage enterprise risks.



Differentiation through Technology and Domain Expertise

We seek a technology leadership position in industrial automation. We believe that our three platforms - integrated architecture, intelligent motor control and solutions and services - provide the foundation for long-term sustainable growth.

Our integrated control and information architecture, with Logix at its core, is an important differentiator. We are the only automation provider that can support discrete, process, batch, safety, motion and motor control on the same hardware platform with the same software programming environment.  Our integrated architecture is scalable with standard open communications protocols making it easier for customers to implement more cost effectively.

Intelligent motor control is one of our core competencies and an important aspect of an automation system. These products and solutions enhance the availability, efficiency and safe operation of our customers' critical and most energy-intensive plant assets.  Our intelligent motor control offering can be integrated seamlessly with the Logix architecture.

Domain expertise refers to solutions and services that we provide to support customers through the entire life cycle of their automation investment.  The combination of industry-specific domain expertise of our people with our innovative technologies enables us to help our customers solve their manufacturing and business challenges.

Global Expansion

As the manufacturing world continues to expand, we must be able to meet our customers’ needs in emerging markets. We continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets. We currently have approximately

60 percent

of our employees outside the U.S., and

51 percent

of our revenues outside of the U.S.

As we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products, solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions. We have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing, product development and customer facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world. Growth in the emerging markets of Asia-Pacific, including China and India, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa is projected to exceed global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates, due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middle-class population. We believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.

Enhanced Market Access

Over the past decade, our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to approximately $80 billion.  Our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity.  Logix is the technology foundation that enabled us to become an industry leader for batch process applications and to compete effectively with traditional Distributed Control Systems (DCS) providers for continuous process applications.  We complement that with a growing global network of engineers and partners to provide solutions to process customers.

OEMs represent another area of addressed market expansion and a strong growth opportunity.  To remain competitive, OEMs need to find the optimal balance of machine cost and performance while reducing their time to market. Our scalable integrated architecture and intelligent motor control offerings, along with design productivity tools and our motion and safety products, can assist OEMs in addressing these business needs.

We have developed a powerful network of channel partners, technology partners and commercial partners that act as amplifiers to our internal capabilities and enable us to serve our customers’ needs around the world.

Broad Range of Industries Served

We apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges. We serve customers in a wide range of industries, including consumer products, resource-based and transportation.

Our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences industries. These customers’ needs include new capacity, incremental capacity from existing facilities, an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance. These customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors.



We serve customers in resource-based industries, including oil and gas, mining, aggregates, cement, metals, energy, pulp and paper and water/wastewater. Companies in these industries typically invest when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is increasing.

In the transportation industry, factors such as geographic expansion, investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers’ automation investment decisions. Our sales in transportation are primarily to automotive and tire manufacturers.

Outsourcing and Sustainability Trends

Demand for our products, solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers. Customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base. Our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally.

We help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency, environmental and safety goals. Higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to invest in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor control and energy efficient solutions and services. In addition, environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices.

Acquisitions

Our acquisition strategy focuses on products, solutions or services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings. In October 2012, we acquired certain assets of the medium voltage drives business of Harbin Jiuzhou Electric Co., Ltd., a leading manufacturer of medium voltage drives, direct current power supplies, switch gear and wind inverters, headquartered in Harbin, China. The acquisition strengthened our presence in the Asia-Pacific motor control market by adding significant capabilities in design, engineering and manufacturing of medium voltage drive products. In March 2012, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of SoftSwitching Technologies Corporation, an industrial power quality detection and protection systems provider in the United States. In May 2011, we purchased a majority stake in the equity of Lektronix Limited and its affiliate, an independent industrial automation repair and service provider primarily in Europe and Asia. In April 2011, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Hiprom (Pty) Ltd and its affiliates, a process control and automation systems integrator for the mining and mineral processing industry in South Africa.

We believe the acquired companies will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers.

Continuous Improvement

Productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture. We have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement, functional streamlining, material cost savings and manufacturing productivity. We are in the process of developing and implementing common global processes and an enterprise-wide business system. These are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation. Our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization. Charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs.



U. S. Industrial Economic Trends

In


, sales to U.S. customers accounted for

49 percent

of our total sales. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our U.S. served markets include:

•

The Industrial Production Index (Total Index), published by the Federal Reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The Industrial Production Index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2007. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the Industrial Production Index and the level of automation investment made by our U.S. customers in their manufacturing base.

•

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is an indication of the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.

•

Industrial Equipment Spending, which is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy. This measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a reasonable correlation with our domestic growth.

•

Capacity Utilization (Total Industry), which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between Capacity Utilization and levels of U.S. industrial production.

The table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal


to


, which point to moderating growth in manufacturing activity during fiscal 2012. These indicators are among the factors that lead us to anticipate a period of slower industrial growth.  We continue to believe this is a pause in the recovery and not an inflection point.  We expect to see improved market conditions in fiscal 2013 but not until the latter part of the year.

Note: Economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations.



Non-U.S. Regional Trends

In


, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for

51 percent

of our total sales. These customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence. International demand, particularly in emerging markets, has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region, investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets.

We use changes in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business. In 2012, worldwide GDP growth has slowed, and in some regions GDP has declined, indicating a global economic slowdown. In Europe, sovereign debt concerns have put downward pressure on industrial growth. Western Europe continues to operate in a recessionary environment, with potential for an improved outlook in some economies later next year.  The emerging markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) experienced strong growth that is expected to continue next year.  In Asia, China experienced its slowest GDP growth since early 2009 but the economy shows some signs of improvement. India was flat in 2012 compared to 2011, and there is no indication of any near term improvement. In Latin America, Mexico was the strongest performing country with projected continued growth.  Brazil experienced an economic slowdown in 2012 but the outlook is for some improvement in 2013. We still expect that emerging markets will be the fastest growing automation markets over the long term.



Summary of Results of Operations

Despite a difficult economic environment in


, we delivered sales growth of

4 percent

, or

6 percent

organically, and ended the year with record sales of

$6,259.4 million

Income from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased 58 percent from $440.4 million in 2010 to $697.1 million in 2011. The increase was predominantly due to increased volume, partially offset by increased spending to support growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $137.9 million from $1,323.3 to $1,461.2, but decreased as a percentage of sales by 2.8 points to 24.4 percent as volume increases outpaced spending increases.

General corporate expenses were net of a $3.8 million gain in 2011 resulting from the sale of an investment.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2011 was 19.7 percent compared to 19.1 percent in 2010. The 2011 and 2010 effective tax rates were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent because our sales outside of the U.S. benefited from lower tax rates.

During 2011, we recognized net discrete tax benefits of $25.0 million related to the favorable resolution of worldwide tax matters and the retroactive extension of the U.S. federal research credit. During 2010, we recognized discrete tax benefits of $27.2 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters, partially offset by discrete tax expenses of $9.6 million primarily related to the impact of a change in Mexican tax law and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 15 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2011 and 2010 affecting the respective tax rates.

Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations was $0.7 million in 2011 compared to $23.9 million in 2010. Income from discontinued operations in the prior year included a $21.3 million tax benefit resulting from the resolution of a domestic tax matter relating to the January 2007 sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses.

Architecture & Software

Sales

Architecture & Software sales increased 23 percent to $2,594.3 million in 2011 compared to $2,115.0 million in 2010. Organic sales increased 20 percent, and the effects of currency translation contributed 3 percentage points to the total increase. Substantially all of the organic sales increase resulted from increased volume due to positive macroeconomic conditions in most regions and industries. Pricing had an immaterial effect on revenue during the period. Year-over-year sales increases in all regions other than the United States were greater than the segment average rate of increase. Logix sales increased 29 percent in 2011 compared to 2010.

Sales

Control Products & Solutions sales increased 24 percent to $3,406.1 million in 2011 compared to $2,742.0 million in 2010. Organic sales increased 20 percent, and the effects of currency translation and acquisitions contributed 3 percentage points and 1 percentage point, respectively, to the total increase. The segment’s organic sales increase resulted from growth in both products and solutions and services businesses, which grew at rates similar to the segment average. Latin America, Asia-Pacific and EMEA reported year-over-year growth above the segment average, while year-over-year sales increases in the United States and Canada were less than the segment average growth rate. Pricing had an immaterial effect on revenue during the period.

Operating Margin

Control Products & Solutions segment operating earnings were $368.5 million in 2011, up 52 percent from $241.8 million in the same period of 2010. Operating margin increased 2.0 points to 10.8 percent in 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase was predominantly due to volume increases, partially offset by sales mix and increased spending to support growth.



Introduction of new non-GAAP measures and changes to definition of segment operating earnings for fiscal 2013

In order to provide transparency into the operational results of our business, beginning in fiscal 2013, we will provide non-GAAP earnings measures (Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS) that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related tax effects from income from continuing operations.  We define non-operating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements.  These components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operational performance of our business.  In addition, we will redefine segment operating earnings to exclude non-operating pension costs.  Service cost and amortization of prior service cost will continue to be included in our segment operating earnings as these components of net periodic benefit cost represent the operating cost of providing pension benefits to our employees.

Adjusted Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Income are non-GAAP measures that exclude the effects of the non-operating pension costs and their related tax effects.  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period.  Our measures of Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS may be different from measures used by other companies.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations and diluted EPS.

Operating and Non-Operating Pension Costs



Segment Operating Earnings (non-GAAP)

The table below reflects our operating results for years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 with non-operating pension costs reclassified to their own line item for all periods presented.  These costs were previously included in the operating earnings of each segment and in general corporate-net.  Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 non-operating pension costs excluded from Architecture & Software segment operating earnings were $11.6 million, $11.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively.   Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 non-operating pension costs excluded from Control Products & Solutions segment operating earnings were $20.9 million, $9.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 non-operating pension costs excluded from general corporate-net were $2.7 million, $2.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.


Total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.



Financial Condition

The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions):

Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. Cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings and thus does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. Our accounting for share-based compensation requires us to report the related excess income tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.

Free cash flow was a source of

$597.6 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2012

compared to a source of

$561.7 million

for the year ended

September 30, 2011

. Free cash flow for 2012 and 2011 include discretionary pre-tax contributions to our U.S. qualified pension trust of $300 million and $150 million, respectively.  The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and a smaller increase in working capital, partially offset by a higher discretionary pre-tax contribution to our U.S. qualified pension trust in 2012.

We purchased

$487.5 million

of short-term investments in the year ended

September 30, 2012

, of which

$137.5 million

matured during the same period.

We repurchased approximately

3.7 million

shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in


. The total cost of these shares was

$265.3 million

, of which

$7.6 million

was recorded in accounts payable at

September 30, 2012

, related to

110,000

shares that did not settle until October


. In


, we repurchased approximately

4.0 million

shares of our common stock. The total cost of these shares was

$299.2 million

, of which

$1.7 million

was recorded in accounts payable at

September 30, 2011

, related to

30,000

shares that did not settle until October


. Our decision to repurchase stock in


will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price. At

September 30, 2012

we had approximately

$936.7 million

remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization. See Part II, Item 5,

Market for the Company’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

, for additional information regarding share repurchases.

We expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our retirement plans, acquisitions of businesses, dividends to shareowners, repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt. We expect capital expenditures in


to be about $150 million. We expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term investments, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities.



Given our extensive international operations, a significant amount of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (funds) are held in non-U.S. subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested.  Generally, these funds would be subject to U.S. tax if repatriated.  The percentage of such non-U.S. funds can vary from quarter to quarter with a range of approximately 70 percent to 90 percent over the past eight quarters.  As of

September 30, 2012

, approximately 90 percent of our funds were held in such non-U.S. subsidiaries.  We have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations.

In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Commercial paper is our principal source of short-term financing. At

September 30, 2012

, commercial paper borrowings outstanding were

$157.0 million

, with a weighted average interest rate of

0.27 percent

. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended

September 30, 2011

. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was

36.4 percent

at

September 30, 2012

and

34.1 percent

at

September 30, 2011

.

At

September 30, 2012

and


, our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015, was $750.0 million. We have not borrowed against this credit facility at

September 30, 2012

or


. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of this credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants under this credit facility at

September 30, 2012

and


. Separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately

$120.6 million

at

September 30, 2012

were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Among other uses, we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the short-term credit ratings set forth in the table below. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.

The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of

September 30, 2012

:

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. We have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.

We regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.

We enter into contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain third-party sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.

A summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at

September 30, 2012

are (in millions):

(a)

The amounts for long-term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. The amounts include interest, but exclude the unamortized discount of

$45.0 million

. See Note 6 in the Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt.

(b)

Our postretirement plans are unfunded and are subject to change. Amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.

(c)

Amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates of known commitments. Contributions to our pension plans beyond


will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time. Amounts subsequent to


are excluded from the summary above, as these amounts cannot be estimated with certainty. The minimum contribution for our U.S. pension plan as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is currently zero. We may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management.

(d)

This item includes long-term obligations under agreements with various service providers, contractual commitments for capital expenditures and contractually required cash payments for acquisitions.  Amounts payable in 2013 include $84.4 million for acquisition of the medium voltage drives business of Harbin Jiuzhou Electric Co., Ltd in October 2012. See Note 19 in the Financial Statements for more information regarding the acquisition.

(e)

Other long-term liabilities include environmental liabilities net of related receivables, asset retirement obligations and indemnifications. Amounts subsequent to


are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities will be paid.

(f)

Amount for unrecognized tax benefits includes accrued interest and penalties. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or paid.

Supplemental Sales Information

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency rates affect our reported sales. Sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. We determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.



The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to organic sales (in millions):

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management.

Retirement Benefits — Pension

Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, the retirement rate, the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods.

Our global pension expense in


was

$104.7 million

compared to

$91.4 million

in


. Approximately 72 percent of our


global pension expense relates to our U.S. pension plan. The actuarial assumptions used to determine our


U.S. pension expense included the following: discount rate of

5.20 percent

(compared to

5.60 percent

for


); expected rate of return on plan assets of

8.00 percent

(compared to

8.00 percent

for


); and an assumed long-term compensation increase rate of

4.00 percent

(compared to

4.00 percent

for


).

In


,


and


, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans.  However, we made voluntary contributions of

$300.0 million

,

$150.0 million

, and

$150.0 million

to our U.S pension plans in


,


, and


, respectively.

We estimate our pension expense will be approximately $

168.8 million

in


, an

increase

of approximately

$64.1 million

from


, of which $20.6 million and $43.5 million relate to operating and non-operating pension costs, respectively. Further information on operating and non-operating pension costs is provided in "Introduction of new non-GAAP measures and changes to definition of segment operating earnings for fiscal 2013" section in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis".

For


, our U.S. discount rate will decrease to

4.15 percent

. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. We have assumed a U.S. long-term compensation increase rate of

4.00 percent

in


. We established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension-eligible earnings. Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets will remain at

8.00 percent

. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plans’ invested assets. We also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. The target allocations and ranges of expected return for our major categories of U.S. plan assets are as follows:

The financial markets produced strong results in


. The plan’s Debt Securities return exceeded the expected return range in


, as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values. The plan’s Equity Securities return exceeded the expected return range in


, largely due to higher U.S. equity returns. While the financial markets continue to experience volatility, we have not changed our expectation for long-term returns for the asset categories in which our plan assets are invested. Actual return for our portfolio of U.S. plan assets was approximately

6.60 percent

annualized for the 15 years ended

September 30, 2012

, and was approximately

9.00 percent

annualized for the 20 years ended

September 30, 2012

.

The changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost. The change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation. The change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation.



The following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and annual net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):

More information regarding pension benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

For approximately

80 percent

of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.  Within this category, we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products and/or the performance of services, such as installation and commissioning.  The timing of delivery, though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component, is generally short-term in nature.  For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that element's relative selling price, provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control.  Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item, or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.  If such evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified.

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately

$10.7 million

.



Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of offset exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The accrual for customer returns, rebates and incentives was

$176.6 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$162.0 million

at

September 30, 2011

, of which

$7.9 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$8.0 million

at

September 30, 2011

was included as an offset to accounts receivable.

Litigation, Claims and Contingencies

We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third-party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third-party environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change.

Our accrual for environmental matters was

$45.2 million

, net of related receivables of

$32.1 million

, at

September 30, 2012

and

$41.1 million

, net of related receivables of

$32.5 million

, at

September 30, 2011

. Our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations.

Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability where we are self-insured up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers. We estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. The reserve for product liability claims was

$22.3 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$20.1 million

at

September 30, 2011

.

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business. As described in Part I, Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. See Part I, Item 3 for further discussion.

We accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. A significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. We recorded these liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which totaled

$3.4 million

in other current liabilities and

$22.4 million

in other liabilities at

September 30, 2012

and

$4.7 million

in other current liabilities and

$23.9 million

in other liabilities at

September 30, 2011

.



In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor Electric Company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal, environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January 31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale. We estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate

$13.5 million

, of which

$1.6 million

has been accrued in other current liabilities at September 30, 2012 and 2011, and

$8.8 million

and

$10.1 million

has been accrued in other liabilities at

September 30, 2012

and


, respectively. A significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates.

More information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by U.S. Federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments.

While we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns, taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products, services, and/or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures. The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, was recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the amount of

$70.3 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$75.1 million

at

September 30, 2011

. The amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was

$23.3 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$30.2 million

at

September 30, 2011

. We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Total accrued interest and penalties were

$20.1 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$16.9 million

at

September 30, 2011

. We believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be

reduced

by up to

$1.2 million

during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations.

We recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss, tax credit, and capital loss carryforwards (Carryforwards) and certain temporary differences in the amount of

$31.8 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$32.8 million

at

September 30, 2011

based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the Carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized. Our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more Carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected.

Our consolidated financial statements provide for tax liability on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries that will be repatriated to the U.S. As of September 30, 2012, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes for $2,081.0 million of such earnings, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested outside the U.S.

At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income, permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies. We use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis, excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects. We record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.

More information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 15 in the Financial Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of

$12.4 million

and a liability of

$23.0 million

at

September 30, 2012

. We enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In


, the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations, while in


the relative weakening of the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact. While future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar further strengthens relative to


levels.

Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. For such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts, a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pre-tax income by approximately $10 million.

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately. The ineffective portion was not significant in


and


. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk

In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.

Our short-term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at

September 30, 2012

were

$157.0 million

with remaining maturities of

6 days

at a weighted average interest rate of

0.27 percent

. We had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings at September 30, 2011. As these obligations mature, we issued, and anticipate continuing to issue, additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. In 2012, a 100 basis point increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by $2.7 million.  Due to the low level of variable-rate borrowings in 2011, interest rate changes would not have had a material impact on interest expense.

We had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with a carrying value of

$905.0 million

at

September 30, 2012

and


. The fair value of this debt was

$1,187.9 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$1,125.4 million

at

September 30, 2011

. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity.

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses.

Basis of Presentation

Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto relate to our continuing operations.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and controlled majority owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have control but exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the aggregate to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete inventory; share-based compensation; acquisitions; product warranty obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters, conditional asset retirement obligations and contractual indemnifications; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions prospectively when warranted by factually based experience.

Revenue Recognition

Product and solution revenues consist of industrial automation power, control and information; hardware and software products; and custom-engineered systems. Service revenues include multi-vendor customer technical support and repair, asset management and optimization consulting and training. All service revenue recorded in our results of operations is associated with our Control Products & Solutions segment.

For approximately

80 percent

of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.  Within this category, we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products and/or the performance of services, such as installation and commissioning.  The timing of delivery, though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component, is generally short-term in nature.  For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that element's relative selling price, provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control.  Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item, or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.  If such evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of accounting.  We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others.  Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion.  Under the percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified.  We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies - (Continued)

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Returns, Rebates and Incentives

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of sale based primarily on historical experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of offset exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable.

Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions

Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales, value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenue).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments include time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturities of more than three months but no more than one year at the time of purchase. These investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Receivables

We record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of

$28.0 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$26.1 million

at

September 30, 2011

. In addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain customer returns, rebates and incentives of

$7.9 million

at

September 30, 2012

and

$8.0 million

at

September 30, 2011

.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.

Property

Property, including internal use software, is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line method over


to

40 years

for buildings and improvements,


to

10 years

for machinery and equipment and


to

8 years

for computer hardware and internal-use software. We capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off replaced units. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts.

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies - (Continued)

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as goodwill.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may be present. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We perform an annual impairment test during the second quarter of our fiscal year.

We amortize certain customer relationships on an accelerated basis over the period of which we expect the intangible asset to generate future cash flows. We amortize all other intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives assigned range from


to

10 years

for trademarks,


to

20 years

for customer relationships,


to

17 years

for technology and


to

30 years

for other intangible assets.

Intangible assets also include costs of software developed by our software business to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. Amortization of developed computer software products is calculated on a product-by-product basis as the greater of (a) the unamortized cost at the beginning of the year times the ratio of the current year gross revenue for a product to the total of the current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product, (b) the straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product or (c) one-fourth of the total deferred software cost for the project.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain third-party sale and intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next two years (cash flow hedges) and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. Our accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as hedges under U.S. GAAP. It is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive loss. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations in the period incurred.

Research and Development Expenses

We expense research and development (R&D) costs as incurred; these costs were

$259.1 million

in


,

$254.4 million

in


and

$198.9 million

in


. We include R&D expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We account for uncertain tax positions by determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements based on our assertion of the most likely outcome resulting from an examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.

Earnings Per Share

We present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareowners, which is income excluding the allocation to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested restricted stock. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding share-based compensation awards, which requires us to compute total employee proceeds as the sum of (a) the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award, (b) the amount of unearned share-based compensation costs attributed to future services and (c) the amount of tax benefits, if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the award. Share-based compensation awards for which the total employee proceeds of the award exceed the average market price of the same award over the period have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation awards for the years ended

September 30, 2012

(

2.3 million

shares),


(

2.1 million

shares) and


(

4.9 million

shares) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation. U.S. GAAP requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, to be treated as participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Our participating securities are composed of unvested restricted stock and non-employee director restricted stock units.

The following table reconciles basic and diluted EPS amounts (in millions, except per share amounts):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize share-based compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date.

Product and Workers’ Compensation Liabilities

We record accruals for product and workers’ compensation claims in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability and workers’ compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued.

Environmental Matters

We record accruals for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods in which the estimated costs of remediation change. At third-party environmental sites for which more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites for which we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount to their present value future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable, we record a receivable for the estimated recovery.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend and simplify the rules related to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment. The revised guidance allows an entity to perform an initial qualitative assessment, based on the entity’s events and circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The results of this qualitative assessment determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. The new guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

2. Acquisitions

In March 2012, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of SoftSwitching Technologies Corporation (SoftSwitching), an industrial power quality detection and protection systems provider in the United States. We recorded no goodwill associated with this acquisition.

In April 2011, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Hiprom (Pty) Ltd and its affiliates (Hiprom), a process control and automation systems integrator for the mining and mineral processing industry in South Africa. In May 2011, we purchased a majority stake in the equity of Lektronix Limited and its affiliate (Lektronix), an independent industrial automation repairs and service provider in Europe and Asia.

We purchased the remaining minority shares for

$10.9 million

in December 2011.

The aggregate purchase price of the Hiprom and Lektronix acquisitions was

$58.8 million

. We recorded goodwill of

$34.8 million

attributable to intangible assets that do not meet the criteria for separate recognition, including an assembled workforce with industry-wide technical expertise and customer service capabilities. We assigned the full amount of goodwill for Hiprom and Lektronix to our Control Products & Solutions segment. None of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The fair values and weighted average useful lives that have been assigned to the acquired identifiable intangible assets of these acquisitions are:

The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations since the dates of acquisition. Pro forma financial information and allocation of the purchase price are not presented as the effects of these acquisitions are not material to our results of operations or financial position.

.  We have not borrowed against this credit facility at

September 30, 2012

or


. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of this credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed

60 percent

. We were in compliance with all covenants under this credit facility at

and


. Separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately

$120.6 million

at

9. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurement

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years (cash flow hedges). Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities.

We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We value our forward exchange contracts using a market approach. We use a valuation model based on inputs including forward and spot prices for currency and interest rate curves. We did not change our valuation techniques during fiscal


,


, or


. We report in other comprehensive income (loss) the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that we designate and that qualify as cash flow hedges. We reclassify these gains or losses into earnings in the same periods when the hedged transactions affect earnings. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which we do not elect hedge accounting are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in each period, based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments.

It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We diversify our forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Most of our forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The notional values of our forward exchange contracts outstanding at

September 30, 2012

were

$994.6 million

, of which

$614.6 million

were designated as cash flow hedges. Currency pairs (buy / sell) comprising the most significant contract notional value were United States dollar (USD) / euro, USD / Canadian dollar, Swiss franc / euro, Swiss franc / USD, Singapore dollar / USD, and Swiss franc / Canadian dollar.

We also use foreign currency denominated debt obligations to hedge portions of our net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The currency effects of the debt obligations are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareowners’ equity where they offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally. We had

$14.6 million

and

$14.1 million

of foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges at

September 30, 2012

and


, respectively.

U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. U.S. GAAP also classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:

Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and their location in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were (in millions):

$0.3 million

(

$0.2 million

net of tax) of net unrealized

gains

on cash flow hedges as of

September 30, 2012

will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. We expect that these net unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings.

The pre-tax amount of (losses) gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to derivative forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, which offset the related losses and gains on the hedged items during the periods presented, was:

The amount recognized in earnings as a result of ineffective hedges was not significant.

Our 2012 Long-Term Incentives Plan (2012 Plan) authorizes us to deliver up to

6.8 million

shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, or upon grant or in payment of stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock units and restricted stock. Our 2003 Directors Stock Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to

0.5 million

shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options or upon grant of shares of our common stock and restricted stock units. Shares relating to awards under our 2012 Plan, 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, or our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, as amended, that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance or delivery of shares will be available for further awards under the 2012 Plan. Approximately

6.9 million

shares under our 2012 Plan and

0.3 million

shares under our 2003 Directors Stock Plan remain available for future grant or payment at

September 30, 2012

. We use treasury stock to deliver shares of our common stock under these plans. Our 2012 Plan does not permit share-based compensation awards to be granted after February 7, 2022.

Stock Options

We have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under various incentive plans at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates. The exercise price for stock options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares. Stock options expire

ten years

after the grant date and vest ratably over

three years

, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was

$43.9 million

,

$157.3 million

and

$49.7 million

during


,


and


, respectively. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions:

The average risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using daily historical volatility of our stock price over the most recent period corresponding to the expected term as of the grant date. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options.

A summary of stock option activity for the year ended

September 30, 2012

is:

Performance Share Awards

Certain officers and key employees are also eligible to receive shares of our common stock in payment of performance share awards granted to them. Grantees of performance shares will be eligible to receive shares of our common stock depending upon our total shareowner return, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to the performance of the S&P 500 over a

three

-year period.

The average risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. treasury security rate in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. The expected volatilities were determined using daily historical volatility for the most recent three-year period as of the grant date.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

12. Retirement Benefits

We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Effective July 1, 2010 we closed participation in our U.S. and Canada pension plans to employees hired after June 30, 2010. Employees hired after June 30, 2010 are instead eligible to participate in employee savings plans. The Company contributions are based on age and years of service and range from

3% to 7%

of eligible compensation. Effective October 1, 2010, we also closed participation in our UK pension plan to employees hired after September 30, 2010 and these employees are now eligible for a defined contribution plan. Benefits to be provided to plan participants hired before July 1, 2010 or October 1, 2010, respectively, are not affected by these changes. Our policy with respect to funding our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We may, however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Other postretirement benefits are primarily in the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our United States employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible employees and dependents after retirement.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost Assumptions

Significant assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit cost for the period ended September 30 are (in weighted averages):

Net Benefit Obligation Assumptions

Significant assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations are (in weighted averages):

____________________

(1)

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the estimated increase in gross medical claims costs. As a result of the plan amendment adopted effective October 1, 2002, our effective per person retiree medical cost increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for the majority of our postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we assume the gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease to

5.50%

in


.

Decreasing to

4.50%

in


.

In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we consider actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets. We also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. This resulted in the selection of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global weighted-average targeted and actual asset allocations at September 30, by asset category, are:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

12. Retirement Benefits - (Continued)

The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the plan’s benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager.

As of

September 30, 2012

and


, our pension plans do not own our common stock.

In certain countries where we operate, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a separate pension fund.

The valuation methodologies used for our pension plans’ investments measured at fair value are described as follows. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at

September 30, 2012

and


.

Common stock

— Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

Mutual funds

— Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual funds are traded.

Corporate debt

— Valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.

Government securities

— Valued at the most recent closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

Common collective trusts

— Valued at the net asset value (NAV) as determined by the custodian of the fund. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding.

Private equity and alternative equity

— Valued at the estimated fair value, as determined by the respective fund manager, based on the net asset value of the investment units held at year end which is subject to judgment.

Real estate -

Consists of the direct investment into Swiss real estate (2011 only) and real estate funds.  Real estate funds provide an indirect investment into a diversified and multi-sector portfolio of property assets.  Real estate funds are valued at the most recent closing price reported on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Insurance contracts

— Valued at the aggregate amount of accumulated contribution and investment income less amounts used to make benefit payments and administrative expenses which approximates fair value.

Other

— Consists of other fixed income investments and common collective trusts with a mix of equity and fixed income underlying assets. Other fixed income investments are valued at the most recent closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

September 30, 2012

and

$114.2 million

at

September 30, 2011

.

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes for

$2,081.0 million

of undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that may be payable upon distribution.

We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize current and long-term deferred tax assets through the reduction of future taxable income, other than for the deferred tax assets reflected below. Significant factors we considered in determining the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include our historical operating results and expected future earnings.

primarily due to the utilization of a non-U.S. capital loss carryforward.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments.

A reconciliation of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):

The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized was

$70.3 million

(

$23.3 million

net of offsetting tax benefits) as of

September 30, 2012

,

$75.1 million

(

$30.2 million

net of offsetting tax benefits) as of

September 30, 2011

and

$57.5 million

(

$9.5 million

net of offsetting tax benefits) as of

September 30, 2010

. Offsetting tax benefits primarily consist of tax receivables that were recorded in other assets and foreign tax credit items that were recorded in deferred income taxes.

During


, there was no material change in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

15. Income Taxes - (Continued)

During the next 12 months, we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be

reduced

by up to

$1.2 million

and the amount of offsetting tax benefits could be

reduced

by up to

$0.8 million

as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations.

We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Benefits (expense) recognized were

$(3.1) million

16. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Environmental Matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.

We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at


Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at

September 30, 2012

to be

$14.3 million

, of which

$8.0 million

has been accrued.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements, or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As of

September 30, 2012

, we have estimated the total reasonably possible costs we could incur from these matters to be

$88.1 million

. We have recorded environmental accruals for these matters of

$38.9 million

. In addition to the above matters, certain environmental liabilities are substantially indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation. At

September 30, 2012

, we recorded a liability of

$30.4 million

and a receivable of

$29.1 million

for these matters. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs that we could incur from these matters to be

$37.1 million

.

Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. We recorded

$3.4 million

in other current liabilities and

$22.4 million

in other liabilities for these obligations at

September 30, 2012

. At

September 30, 2011

, we recorded liabilities for these asset retirement obligations of

$4.7 million

in other current liabilities and

$23.9 million

in other liabilities.

. Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated

$377.6 million

as of

September 30, 2012

and are payable as follows (in millions):

Commitments from third parties under sublease agreements having noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated

$1.4 million

as of

September 30, 2012

and are receivable through 2017 at approximately

$0.3 million

per year. Most leases contain renewal options for varying periods, and certain leases include options to purchase the leased property.

Other Matters

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. Currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. In some cases, the claims involve products from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our former Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us, which occurred on January 31, 2007. We are also responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against our former Rockwell International Corporation's divested measurement and flow control business. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising from our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. Following litigation against Nationwide Indemnity Company (Nationwide) and Kemper Insurance (Kemper), the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to Allen-Bradley, we entered into separate agreements on April 1, 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. In exchange for a lump sum payment, Kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to Allen-Bradley. Nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. We believe that this arrangement with Nationwide will continue to provide coverage for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability.

The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

16. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities - (Continued)

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.

In connection with the spin-offs of our former automotive component systems business, semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the respective businesses, including environmental and intellectual property matters.

In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor Electric Company for costs and damages related to certain legal, legacy environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January 31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale. We estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate

$13.5 million

, of which

$1.6 million

has been accrued in other current liabilities and

$8.8 million

has been accrued in other liabilities at

September 30, 2012

. We recorded

$1.6 million

and

$10.1 million

in other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, at

September 30, 2011

for these indemnifications.

In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in other contracts with third parties, such as contracts concerning the development and manufacture of our products, the divestiture of businesses and the licensing of intellectual property. Due to the number of agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential future payments.

17. Business Segment Information

Rockwell Automation is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses. We determine our operating segments based on the information used by our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, to allocate resources and assess performance. Based upon these criteria, we organized our products and services into two operating segments: Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions.

Architecture & Software

The Architecture & Software segment contains all of the hardware, software and communication components of our integrated control and information architecture capable of controlling the customer’s industrial processes and connecting with their manufacturing enterprise. Architecture & Software has a broad portfolio of products including:

•

Control platforms that perform multiple control disciplines and monitoring of applications, including discrete, batch, continuous process, drives control, motion control and machine safety control. Our platform products include controllers, electronic operator interface devices, electronic input/output devices, communication and networking products and industrial computers. The information-enabled Logix controllers provide integrated multi-discipline control that is modular and scalable.

•

Software products that include configuration and visualization software used to operate and supervise control platforms, advanced process control software and manufacturing execution software (MES) that addresses information needs between the factory floor and a customer’s enterprise business system.

•

Other Architecture & Software products, including rotary and linear motion control products, sensors and machine safety components.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

17. Business Segment Information - (Continued)

Control Products & Solutions

The Control Products & Solutions segment combines a comprehensive portfolio of intelligent motor control and industrial control products, application expertise and project management capabilities. This comprehensive portfolio includes:

•

Low and medium voltage electro-mechanical and electronic motor starters, motor and circuit protection devices, AC/DC variable frequency drives, push buttons, signaling devices, termination and protection devices, relays and timers and condition sensors.

•

Value-added solutions ranging from packaged solutions such as configured drives and motor control centers to automation and information solutions where we provide design, integration and start-up services for custom-engineered hardware and software systems primarily for manufacturing applications.

•

Services designed to help maximize a customer’s automation investment and provide total life-cycle support, including technical support and repair, customized safety solutions, asset management, training and predictive and preventative maintenance.

The following tables reflect the sales and operating results of our reportable segments for the years ended

September 30

(in millions):

Among other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based upon segment operating earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices, certain nonrecurring corporate initiatives, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses and incremental acquisition related expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments such as intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory and purchased research and development charges. Depending on the product, intersegment sales within a single legal entity are either at cost or cost plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market price. Sales between legal entities are at an appropriate transfer price. We allocate costs related to shared segment operating activities to the segments using a methodology consistent with the expected benefit.

Redefining segment operating earnings for fiscal 2013

Beginning in fiscal 2013, we are changing our definition of segment operating earnings to also exclude non-operating pension costs.  Non-operating pension costs consist of defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements.  We will continue to include service cost and amortization of prior service cost in the business segment that incurred the expense.

In October 2012, we acquired certain assets of the medium voltage drives business of Harbin Jiuzhou Electric Co., Ltd. (Harbin), a leading manufacturer of medium voltage drives, direct current power supplies, switch gear and wind inverters, headquartered in Harbin, China.  The acquisition strengthened our presence in the Asia-Pacific motor control market by adding significant capabilities in design, engineering and manufacturing of medium voltage drive products. The preliminary purchase price of the acquisition was

September 30, 2012

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rockwell Automation, Inc. as of

September 30, 2012

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

September 30, 2012

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2012

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

September 30, 2012

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2012

has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

As previously disclosed, we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprise-wide information technology system.  Additional implementations will occur at the remaining locations of our company throughout fiscal 2013-2014.
