PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or
Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of industrial
automation power, control and information products and services.
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1996 and is the
successor to the former Rockwell International Corporation as
the result of a tax-free reorganization completed on
December 6, 1996, pursuant to which the Company divested
its former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D
Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). The predecessor
corporation was incorporated in 1928.

On September 30, 1997, we completed the
spinoff of our automotive component systems business into an
independent, separately traded, publicly held company named
Meritor Automotive, Inc. (Meritor). On July 7, 2000,
Meritor and Arvin Industries, Inc. merged to form ArvinMeritor,
Inc. (ArvinMeritor). On December 31, 1998, we completed the
spinoff of our semiconductor systems business (Semiconductor
Systems) into an independent, separately traded, publicly held
company named Conexant Systems, Inc. (Conexant). On
June 29, 2001, we completed the spinoff of our Rockwell
Collins avionics and communications business into an
independent, separately traded, publicly held company named
Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell Collins).

As used herein, the terms “we”,
“us”, “our”, the “Company” or
“Rockwell Automation” include subsidiaries and
predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our
continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.

Where reference is made in any Item of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K to information under specific
captions in Item 7.

, or in Item 8.

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

(the Financial
Statements), or to information in our Proxy Statement for the
Annual Meeting of Shareowners of the Company to be held on
February 2, 2005 (the 2005 Proxy Statement), such
information is incorporated therein by such reference. All date
references to years refer to our fiscal year unless otherwise
stated.

Operating Segments

We have two operating segments: Control Systems
and Power Systems. In 2004, our total sales were
$4.4 billion. Financial information with respect to our
business segments, including their contributions to sales and
operating earnings for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 2004, is contained under the caption

Results of Operations

in

MD&A

on page 14
hereof, and in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.

Control
Systems

Control Systems is our largest operating segment
with 2004 sales of $3.7 billion (83 percent of our
total sales) and approximately 16,800 employees at
September 30, 2004. Control Systems supplies industrial
automation products, systems, software and services focused on
helping customers control and improve manufacturing processes
and is divided into three business groups: the Components and
Packaged Applications Group (CPAG), the Automation Control and
Information Group (ACIG) and Global Manufacturing Solutions
(GMS).

CPAG supplies industrial components, power
control and motor management products, and packaged and
engineered products and systems. CPAG’s sales account for
approximately 40 percent of Control Systems’ sales.

ACIG’s core products are used primarily to
control and monitor industrial plants and processes and
typically consist of a processor and input/output (I/O) devices.
Our integrated architecture and Logix controllers perform
multiple types of control applications, including discrete,
batch, continuous process, drive system, motion and machine
safety across various factory floor operations. ACIG’s
sales account for approximately 40 percent of Control
Systems’ sales.


GMS provides multi-vendor automation and
information systems and solutions that help customers improve
and support their manufacturing operations. GMS’s sales
account for approximately 20 percent of Control
Systems’ sales.

The following is a summary of the major products
and services and major competitors of the Control Systems
business groups:

Depending on the product or service involved,
Control Systems’ competitors range from large diversified
businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation,
to smaller companies specializing in niche products and
services. Factors that influence Control Systems’
competitive position are its broad product portfolio and scope
of solutions, technology leadership, knowledge of customer
applications, large installed base, established distribution
network, quality of products and services and global presence.

Control Systems’ products are marketed
primarily under the Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software brand
names. Major markets served include consumer products,
transportation, oil and gas, mining, metals and forest products.

In North America, Control Systems’ products
are sold primarily through independent distributors that
generally do not carry products that compete with Allen-Bradley
products. Large systems and service offerings are sold
principally through a direct sales force, though opportunities
are sometimes sourced through distributors or system
integrators. Product sales outside the United States occur
through a combination of direct sales, sales through
distributors and sales through system integrators.

In 2004, sales in the United States accounted for
56 percent of Control Systems’ sales. Outside the
U.S., Control Systems’ primary markets were Canada,
Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, China, Korea and Australia.

Control Systems is headquartered in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin and has operations in North America, Europe,
Asia-Pacific and South America.


Power Systems

Power Systems recorded 2004 sales of
$752.5 million (17 percent of our total sales) and had
approximately 4,000 employees at September 30, 2004. Power
Systems is divided into two businesses: Dodge mechanical
(Mechanical) and Reliance electrical (Electrical).

The following is a summary of the major products
and services and major competitors of the Power Systems
businesses:

Depending on the product involved, Power
Systems’ competitors range from large diversified
businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation,
to smaller companies specializing in niche products and
services. Factors that influence Power Systems’ competitive
position are product quality, installed base and its established
distributor network. While Power Systems’ competitive
position is strong in North America, it is limited somewhat by
its small presence outside the United States.

Mechanical’s products are marketed primarily
under the Dodge brand name while Electrical’s products are
marketed primarily under the Reliance Electric brand name. Major
markets served include mining, cement, aggregates,
environmental, forest products, food/beverage, oil and gas,
metals and material handling.

Mechanical’s products are sold primarily
through distributors while Electrical’s products are sold
primarily through a direct sales force.

In 2004, sales in the United States accounted for
89 percent of Power Systems’ sales. Outside the U.S.,
Power Systems’ primary markets were Canada, China and
Mexico.

Power Systems is headquartered in Greenville,
South Carolina and has operations in North America, Europe and
Asia-Pacific.

Divestitures

In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact
business. Additional information relating to this divestiture is
contained in Note 13 in the Financial Statements.

Geographic Information

In 2004, sales in the United States accounted for
62 percent of our total sales. Our principal markets
outside the United States are in Canada, Germany, the United
Kingdom, Italy, China, Korea and Mexico. In addition to normal
business risks, our non-U.S. operations are subject to
other risks including, among other factors, political, economic
and social environments, governmental laws and regulations and
currency revaluations and fluctuations.


Sales and property information by major
geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2004 is contained in Note 18 in the
Financial Statements.

Research and Development

Our research and development spending is
summarized as follows:

Customer-sponsored research and development was
not material in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Employees

At September 30, 2004, we had approximately
21,000 employees. Nearly 14,000 were employed in the United
States, and, of these employees, about 7 percent were
represented by various local or national unions.

Raw Materials and Supplies

We purchase many items of equipment, components
and materials used in the production of our products from
others. The raw materials essential to the conduct of each of
our business segments generally are available at competitive
prices. Although we have a broad base of suppliers and
subcontractors, we are dependent upon the ability of our
suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality
specifications and delivery schedules. We have in the past
experienced shortages of certain components and materials, which
had an adverse effect on our ability to make timely deliveries
of certain products. Market forces, particularly for certain raw
materials, have also caused significant increases in costs of
those materials. Both shortages and cost increases, if they
occur again, could have an adverse effect on our operating
results.

Backlog

Our total order backlog was $500.4 million
at September 30, 2004 and $395.5 million at
September 30, 2003. Backlog is not necessarily indicative
of results of operations for future periods due to the
short-cycle nature of most of our sales activities.

Environmental Protection
Requirements

Information about the effect on the Company and
its manufacturing operations of compliance with environmental
protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims
is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. See
also Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

, on
page 6 hereof.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

We own or license numerous patents and patent
applications related to our products and operations. Various
claims of patent infringement and requests for patent
indemnification have been made to us. We believe that none of
these claims will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition. See Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

, on page 6 hereof. While in the
aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the
operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or
termination of any one of them would materially affect our
business or financial condition.

The Company’s name and its registered
trademark “Rockwell Automation” is important to each
of our business segments. In addition, we own other important
trademarks we use for certain of our products and services, such
as “Allen-Bradley” and “A-B” for electronic
controls and systems for industrial automation,


“Reliance” and “Reliance
Electric” for electric motors and drives and
“Dodge” for mechanical power transmission products.

Seasonality

Our business segments are generally not subject
to seasonality.

Item 2.

Properties.

At September 30, 2004, we operated 69
plants, principally in North America. We also had 279 sales and
administrative offices and a total of 32 warehouses, service
centers, and other facilities. The aggregate floor space of our
facilities was approximately 14.3 million square feet. Of
this floor space, we owned approximately 60 percent and
leased approximately 40 percent. Manufacturing space
occupied approximately 7.0 million square feet. Our Control
Systems segment occupied approximately 4.4 million square
feet, and our Power Systems segment occupied the remaining
approximately 2.6 million square feet of manufacturing
space. At September 30, 2004, approximately
1.1 million square feet of floor space was not in use,
principally in owned facilities.

There are no major encumbrances (other than
financing arrangements, which in the aggregate are not material)
on any of our plants or equipment. In our opinion, our
properties have been well maintained, are in sound operating
condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to
operate at present levels.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Rocky Flats Plant.

On January 30, 1990, a civil action was brought in the
United States District Court for the District of Colorado
against us and another former operator of the Rocky Flats Plant
(the Plant), Golden, Colorado, that we operated from 1975
through December 31, l989 for the Department of Energy
(DOE). The action alleges the improper production, handling and
disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances,
constituting, among other things, violations of various
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and
misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto.
The plaintiffs, who purportedly represent two classes, sought
compensatory damages of $250 million for diminution in
value of real estate and other economic loss; the creation of a
fund of $150 million to finance medical monitoring and
surveillance services; exemplary damages of $300 million;
CERCLA response costs in an undetermined amount; attorneys’
fees; an injunction; and other proper relief. On
February 13, 1991, the court granted certain of the motions
of the defendants to dismiss the case. The plaintiffs
subsequently filed a new complaint, and on November 26,
1991, the court granted in part a renewed motion to dismiss. The
remaining portion of the case is pending before the court. On
October 8, 1993, the court certified separate medical
monitoring and property value classes. Effective August 1,
1996, the DOE assumed control of the defense of the contractor
defendants, including us, in the action. Beginning on that date,
the costs of our defense, which had previously been reimbursed
to us by the DOE, have been and are being paid directly by the
DOE. We believe that we are entitled under applicable law and
our contract with the DOE to be indemnified for all costs and
any liability associated with this action.


On November 13, 1990, we were served with
another civil action brought against us in the same court by
James Stone, claiming to act in the name of the United States,
alleging violations of the U.S. False Claims Act in
connection with our operation of the Plant (and seeking treble
damages and forfeitures) as well as a personal cause of action
for alleged wrongful termination of employment. On
August 8, 1991, the court dismissed the personal cause of
action. On December 6, 1995, the DOE notified us that it
would no longer reimburse costs incurred by us in defense of the
action. On November 19, 1996, the court granted the
Department of Justice leave to intervene in the case on the
government’s behalf. On April 1, 1999 a jury awarded
the plaintiffs approximately $1.4 million in damages. On
May 18, 1999, the court entered judgment against us for
approximately $4.2 million, trebling the jury’s award
as required by the False Claims Act, and imposing a civil
penalty of $15,000. If the judgment is affirmed on appeal,
Mr. Stone will also be entitled to an award of
attorney’s fees but the court refused to award fees until
appeals from the judgment have been exhausted. On
September 24, 2001, a panel of the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the judgment. On November 2, 2001, we
filed a petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeals seeking
reconsideration of that portion of the decision holding that the
relator, Mr. Stone, is entitled to an award of
attorneys’ fees. On March 4, 2002, the Court of
Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for the limited
purpose of making findings of fact and conclusions of law
pertaining to Mr. Stone’s relator status and, the
trial court having made findings of fact on the issue, on
March 15, 2004, a panel of the Court of Appeals again ruled
that Mr. Stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’
fees. We believe that ruling is in error and have petitioned the
10th Circuit Court of Appeals for en banc review. We believe
that an outcome adverse to us will not have a material effect on
our business or financial condition. We believe that we are
entitled under applicable law and our contract with the DOE to
be indemnified for all costs and any liability associated with
this action, and intend to file a claim with the DOE seeking
reimbursement at the conclusion of the litigation.

On January 8, 1991, we filed suit in the
United States Claims Court against the DOE, seeking recovery of
$6.5 million of award fees that we allege are owed to us
under the terms of our contract with the DOE for management and
operation of the Plant during the period October 1, 1988
through September 30, 1989. On July 17, 1996, the
government filed an amended answer and counterclaim against us
alleging violations of the U.S. False Claims Act previously
asserted in the civil action described in the preceding
paragraph. On March 20, 1997, the court stayed the case
pending disposition of the civil action described in the
preceding paragraph. On August 30, 1999, the court
continued the stay pending appeal in that civil action. We
believe the government’s counterclaim is without merit, and
believe we are entitled under applicable law and our contract
with the DOE to be indemnified for any liability associated with
the counterclaim.

Russellville.

On
August 13, 2004, we received a favorable ruling from the
Kentucky Supreme Court in the principal case against us by
private plaintiffs arising from alleged environmental
contamination in Russellville, Kentucky from a plant owned and
operated by our Measurement & Flow Control Division prior to
its divestiture in March 1989. This effectively ends a case in
which a $218 million judgment had been entered against us in a
civil action in the Circuit Court of Logan County, Kentucky on a
1996 jury verdict. The action had been brought by owners of
flood plain real property in the area around Russellville
allegedly damaged by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) discharged
from our plant. On January 14, 2000, the Kentucky Court of
Appeals reversed the lower court’s judgment and directed
entry of judgment in our favor on all claims as a matter of law.
On August 8, 2003, the Court of Appeals issued a second
decision holding that the amounts of PCBs alleged by plaintiffs
to have contaminated their properties were insufficient to
constitute an actionable injury under Kentucky law, thus
requiring dismissal of plaintiffs’ suit with prejudice.
Plaintiffs filed a petition for discretionary review with the
Kentucky Supreme Court, which was denied on August 13, 2004.

On March 24, 1997, the Circuit Court of
Franklin County, Kentucky in

Commonwealth of Kentucky,
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet vs.
Rockwell

, an action filed in 1986 seeking remediation of PCB
contamination resulting from unpermitted discharges of PCBs from
our former Russellville, Kentucky plant, entered judgment
establishing PCB cleanup levels for the former plant site and
certain offsite property and ordering additional
characterization of possible contamination in the Mud River and
its flood plain. The Court deferred any decision on the
imposition of civil penalties pending implementation of an
appropriate remediation program. On August 13, 1999, the
Court of Appeals affirmed


the trial court’s judgment, a ruling that
the Supreme Court of the State of Kentucky has let stand. We
have been proceeding with remediation and characterization
efforts consistent with the trial court’s ruling.

Solaia Technology
LLC.

We and our wholly owned
subsidiary Rockwell Software Inc. are parties in several suits
in which Solaia Technology LLC is adverse. Solaia is a
single-purpose entity formed to license US Patent No. 5,038,318
(the ’318 patent). Solaia acquired the ’318 patent
from Schneider Automation, Inc., a competitor of ours in the
field of factory automation. Schneider has retained certain
interests in the ’318 patent, including a share in
Solaia’s licensing income. Solaia has asserted that the
’318 patent covers computer controlled factory automation
systems used throughout most modern factories in the United
States.

Solaia has issued hundreds of demand letters to a
wide range of factory owners and operators, and has filed a
series of lawsuits against over 40 companies alleging patent
infringement. A significant number of the companies sued by
Solaia have chosen to settle the claims for amounts that we
believe are notably smaller than the likely legal costs of
successfully defending Solaia’s claims in court.

In a suit filed by Solaia on July 2, 2002 in
Chicago,

Solaia Technology LLC v. ArvinMeritor, Inc., et
al

. (02-C-4704, N.D. Ill.) (Chicago patent suit), Solaia
accused sixteen companies of infringing the ’318 patent. We
made arrangements with ArvinMeritor, which now owns and operates
our former automotive business, to undertake ArvinMeritor’s
defense of Solaia’s patent claims to seek to assure that
Solaia’s infringement claim against ArvinMeritor could be
finally and actually adjudicated in the Chicago patent suit. In
that case, Solaia responded on May 12, 2003 by suing us
directly for patent infringement, demanding material monetary
damages. We believe that Solaia’s claim against us in the
Chicago patent suit is wholly without merit and baseless.
Discovery is completed in the case and dispositive summary
judgment motions are pending. No trial date has been set in this
matter.

Prior to Solaia’s claims of infringement
against us in the Chicago patent suit (May 12, 2003), we
sought to protect our customers from Solaia’s claims. We
brought an action in federal court in Milwaukee on
December 10, 2002 against Solaia, its law firm Niro,
Scavone, Haller & Niro, and Schneider Automation,

Rockwell Automation, Inc., et al. v. Schneider Automation,
Inc., et al

(Case No. 02-C-1195, E.D. Wis.), asserting
claims of tortious interference and civil conspiracy, and
alleging violations of federal antitrust and unfair competition
laws (the Milwaukee action). We are seeking monetary damages and
other relief arising from the infringement claims Solaia has
made against our customers.

In January 2003, Solaia filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Chicago against us and several others,

Solaia Technology LLC v. Rockwell Automation, Inc., et
al.

, (Case No. 03-C-566, N.D. Ill.), alleging federal
antitrust and unfair competition violations, tortious
interference, defamation and other claims. We deny any liability
under those claims. Solaia’s antitrust and tort case has
now been transferred to the federal court in Milwaukee (Case
No. 03-C-939, E.D. Wis.) and effectively consolidated with
the Milwaukee action, and all proceedings in Milwaukee have been
administratively stayed.

In December 2003, Solaia filed a state court
action in Cook County, Illinois alleging tortious interference
claims against us and one of our former officers. This action
was removed from state court and, as with Solaia’s January
2003 suit, has been transferred to the federal court in
Milwaukee (Case No. 04-C-368, E.D. Wis.).

All of the Milwaukee cases are in their earliest
stages. The federal court in Milwaukee has stayed all three
cases in Milwaukee pending developments in the Chicago patent
suit.

Asbestos.

Like
thousands of other companies, we (including our subsidiaries)
have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal
injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in
certain components of our products many years ago. Currently
there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us,
together with hundreds of other companies, as defendants. The
great bulk of the complaints, however, do not identify any of
our products or specify which of these claimants, if any, were
exposed to asbestos attributable to our products; and past
experience has shown that the vast majority of the claimants
will never identify any of our products. In addition, when our
products appear to be identified, they are frequently from
divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the
costs. For those claimants who do show that they worked with our
products, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses,
in substantial part due to the


integrity of our products, the encapsulated
nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of
any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants.
We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been
dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment
to claimants. We have maintained insurance coverage that we
believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over and above
self-insured retentions, for most of these claims. We have
initiated litigation against our carriers, Nationwide Indemnity
Company and Kemper Insurance, to enforce the insurance policies.
Although Kemper’s status as a financially viable entity is
in question, we expect to recover the majority of defense and
indemnity costs we have incurred to date over and above our
self-insured retentions and a substantial portion of the costs
for defending asbestos claims going forward. The uncertainties
of asbestos claim litigation and resolution of the litigation
with our insurance companies make it difficult to predict
accurately the ultimate resolution of asbestos claims. That
uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings
or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the
settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on
our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe
these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.

Other.

Various other
lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted
or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business,
including those pertaining to product liability, environmental,
safety and health, intellectual property, employment and
contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be
predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or
proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the
disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not
have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition.

Overview

Overall demand for our products is driven by:

•

Levels of global industrial production;

•

Investments in capacity, including upgrades,
    modifications, and expansions of existing manufacturing
    facilities, and the creation of new manufacturing facilities;

•

Regional factors that include local political,
    social, regulatory and economic circumstances; and


•

Industry factors that include customers’ new
    product introductions, trends in the actual and forecasted
    demand for our customers’ products or services, and the
    regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers
    operate.

U.S. Industrial Economic Trends

In 2004, sales in the U.S. accounted for
more than 60 percent of our total sales. Due to weaker
business conditions in 2002 and 2003, especially in the
U.S. manufacturing economy, manufacturers operated at
historically low levels of plant capacity utilization. During
2004, the manufacturing economy experienced improving
fundamentals and higher levels of output. In the U.S., this is
reflected in various indicators that we use to gauge the
direction and momentum of our markets. These indicators include:

•

Industrial equipment spending, which is an
    economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
    (“BEA”). This statistic provides insight into spending
    trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy, which includes
    our primary customer base. This measure, over the longer term,
    has proven to have reasonable predictive value, and to be a good
    directional indicator of our growth trend.

•

Capacity utilization, which is an indication of
    plant operating activity, is published by the Federal Reserve.
    Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between
    capacity utilization and the level of capital investment made by
    our customers in their manufacturing base.

•

The purchasing managers’ index (PMI), as
    published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is
    an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the
    U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates
    that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a
    measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.

The table below depicts the trend for the
indicated months since December 2001 in U.S. industrial
equipment spending, capacity utilization and the PMI.

Non-US Regional Trends

Outside the U.S., growth in demand has in part
been driven by investments made in infrastructure in emerging
economies, such as those found in the Asia-Pacific and Latin
America regions. Demand for our products in China is moderating
somewhat from the rapid expansion experienced in the first half
of 2004 as a result of rising local interest rates and other
economic and political factors but commercial activity in Korea


and India has been strong. In Latin America,
demand for our products has been driven by investment in the
mining and oil and gas industries, resulting in increased sales
in 2004.

Industry Views

We serve a wide range of industries including
consumer products, transportation, basic materials, and oil and
gas. During 2004 we benefited from growing demand in nearly all
of the industries we serve.

Our consumer products segment serves a broad
array of customers in the food and beverage, brewing, consumer
packaged goods and life sciences industries. This group is
generally less cyclical than other heavy manufacturing segments.

Sales to the automotive segment are affected by
such factors as customer investment in new model introductions
and more flexible manufacturing technologies.

Basic materials segments, including mining,
aggregates and cement all benefit from higher commodities prices
and higher global demand for basic materials that encourage
significant investment in capacity and productivity in these
industries.

As energy prices rise, customers in the oil and
gas industry increase their investment in production and
transmission capacity as they did during the latter half of
2004. In addition, higher energy prices have historically caused
customers across all industries to consider new investment in
more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies.

Outlook for 2005

The following is a summary of our objectives for
2005:

Our outlook for 2005 assumes that the current
economic recovery will continue and that we will experience a
favorable industrial environment with gradual growth during
2005. While we expect demand for our products to benefit from
this trend, we also assume that our growth will vary, and may
exceed or lag trend levels in any given quarter.

As of the date hereof, we expect to grow revenue
in 2005 by 6 to 8 percent, excluding the effect of changes
in currency exchange rates, and to raise operating margins to
approximately 15 percent. As of the date hereof, we expect
full year 2005 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.15
to $2.25, and plan to generate free cash flow in excess of net
income in part through disciplined capital deployment.


Summary of Results of
    Operations

In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact
business for cash and a note convertible into a minority
interest in the corporate parent of the buyer of the business
resulting in a gain of $33.5 million ($32.1 million
after tax, or $0.17 per diluted share). The results of
operations of FirstPoint Contact and the gain on sale are
included in Income from Discontinued Operations in this annual
report.

2004 Compared to 2003

Sales increased 10 percent compared to 2003
driven by growth at both Control Systems and Power Systems.
Three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of
changes in currency exchange rates.

Income from continuing operations in 2004
includes $46.3 million ($0.24 per diluted share) of
tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters as
well as the benefit of state tax refunds. The 2003


result included a tax benefit of
$69.4 million ($0.37 per diluted share) related to the
settlement of a U.S. federal research and experimentation
credit refund claim.

Control Systems

Control Systems sales increased 11 percent
compared to 2003. Four percentage points of the sales increase
was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates,
primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to
the U.S. dollar. Sales outside of the U.S. increased
15 percent (6 percent excluding the effect of changes
in currency exchange rates) and U.S. sales increased
8 percent.

Control Systems experienced sales growth in all
regions with exceptional strength in the emerging economies of
Asia and Latin America where we continued to increase market
penetration. Sales growth was primarily driven by maintenance
related and smaller productivity related projects. These
projects were the result of pent-up demand after the period of
under-investment in productive assets during 2002 and 2003. In
addition to these ongoing required investments, we experienced
an increase in activity related to larger scale projects in the
second half of fiscal year 2004. These larger projects were
driven by our customers’ requirements for incremental
productivity improvements and capacity optimization.

Our Logix platform business continued its strong
growth with an increase of 30 percent over 2003. Industrial
components and adjustable speed drives experienced double-digit
growth as well. These gains were partially offset by moderate
declines in drive systems and legacy control platforms.

Segment operating margins increased due to higher
volume, favorable product mix and productivity improvements.
Volume leverage improved during the year due to our continuing
productivity efforts and ongoing facility rationalization
programs.

Power Systems

Power Systems sales increased 7 percent
compared to 2003. The Mechanical and Electrical businesses
contributed about equally to the growth. The sales increase was
mainly the result of volume strength in the second half of 2004.
Higher global demand for basic materials and subsequent higher
prices for these materials encouraged significant investment in
capacity optimization and productivity and drove our sales.

Significant cost and productivity initiatives
launched in the second quarter, financial leverage on
incremental volume, and price increases more than offset rising
raw material prices, resulting in the improved segment operating
margin.

General Corporate — Net

General corporate expenses were
$88.3 million in 2004 compared to $66.8 million in
2003. Expense in 2004 includes charges of $16.4 million due
to higher estimated costs for environmental remediation at
several legacy sites, $7.0 million of contributions to our
charitable corporation, and $5.0 million of costs
associated with corporate staff changes. Expense in 2003
included a charge of $4.7 million due to higher estimated
future costs for environmental remediation at a legacy site.


Loss on Disposition of a Business

In the second quarter of 2003, we sold a majority
of our ownership interest in Reliance Electric Limited Japan
(REJ) resulting in a loss of $8.4 million
($2.5 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share).
The cash proceeds from the transaction totaled
$10.4 million.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $41.7 million in 2004
compared to $52.5 million in 2003. The decrease was the
result of the retirement at maturity of the $150.0 million
principal amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, the benefit
of an interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial
Statements) and lower average short-term borrowings.

2003 Compared to 2002

Sales increased 6 percent compared to 2002.
Three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of
changes in currency exchange rates. The growth was driven by a
7 percent increase at Control Systems which more than
offset a 2 percent decrease at Power Systems.

Income from continuing operations before
accounting change in 2003 included a tax benefit of
$69.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, related to
the settlement of a U.S. federal research and
experimentation credit refund claim. The 2002 results included a
tax benefit of $48.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted
share, from the resolution of certain tax matters for the period
1995 through 1999.

Control Systems

Control Systems sales increased 7 percent
compared to 2002. More than 3 percentage points of the
increase was due to the favorable impact of currency
translation, primarily resulting from the relative strength of
the euro to the U.S. dollar. Sales outside of the
U.S. increased 18 percent (9 percent excluding
the effect of changes in currency exchange rates) and
U.S. sales increased 1 percent. Our Logix platform
business grew approximately 30 percent over 2002.

The improvement in segment operating margin was
due to higher volume and the continuing benefits of cost
reduction actions.

Power Systems


Power Systems sales decreased 2 percent
compared to 2002. Mechanical sales increased 3 percent
while Electrical sales decreased 5 percent. Segment
operating earnings remained relatively stable despite the
decrease in sales due to savings from cost reduction efforts.

General Corporate — Net

General corporate expenses were
$66.8 million in 2003 compared to $57.4 million in
2002. Expense in 2003 included a charge of $4.7 million due
to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation
at a legacy site. The 2002 amount included $9.4 million of
income related to the settlement of intellectual property
matters. Excluding these amounts, corporate expenses decreased
in 2003 as a result of lower corporate staff costs and an
increase of approximately $1.4 million in earnings from our
investment in RSC.

Loss on Disposition of a Business

In the second quarter of 2003, we sold a majority
of our ownership interest in REJ resulting in a loss of
$8.4 million ($2.5 million after tax, or
$0.01 per diluted share). The cash proceeds from the
transaction totaled $10.4 million.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $52.5 million in 2003
compared to $66.1 million in 2002. The decrease was the
result of the retirement at maturity of the $150.0 million
principal amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, the benefit
of an interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial
Statements) and lower average short-term borrowings.

Discontinued Operations

See Note 13 in the Financial Statements for
information regarding the composition of discontinued operations.

Income Taxes

During 2004, we recognized tax benefits of
$46.3 million in Income from Continuing Operations and
$18.4 million in Income from Discontinued Operations
related to the following items:

•

$34.5 million resulting from the resolution
    of certain tax matters, in part related to former businesses. A
    majority of the benefits recognized related to non-U.S. tax
    matters in addition to an agreement with a taxing authority
    related to the treatment of an investment;

•

$4.3 million related to additional state tax
    benefits associated with the U.S. research and
    experimentation credit refund claim in 2003 (see discussion
    below); and

•

$25.9 million related to a refund from the
    State of California for the period 1989 to 1991. Of this amount,
    $7.5 million is included as a reduction in the income tax
    provision and $18.4 million is included in Income from
    Discontinued Operations.

Including these items, the full year effective
tax rate for 2004 was approximately 19 percent. In the
aggregate, these items decreased the effective tax rate by
approximately 11 percent.

During 2003, we recognized in earnings a net tax
benefit of $69.4 million related to a U.S. federal
research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax
benefit of approximately $2.6 million as a result of our
ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which
a valuation allowance had been previously provided. The ability
to utilize the capital loss carryforwards was the result of the
sale of a majority of our ownership in REJ which took place in
2003. The full year effective tax rate for 2003 was
approximately 5 percent, including the effect of the
research and experimentation settlement (23 percent
benefit) and the REJ transaction (1 percent benefit).


See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for
a reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the
effective tax rate.

We expect that the effective income tax rate in
2005 will be approximately 31 percent, excluding the income
tax expense or benefit related to discrete items, if any, that
will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax
effects.

Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the
President signed into law both the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 and the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004. This
legislation contains numerous corporate tax changes, including
eliminating a tax benefit relating to U.S. product exports,
a new deduction relating to U.S. manufacturing, a lower
U.S. tax rate on non-U.S. dividends and an extension
of the research and experimentation credit. This new legislation
is not anticipated to materially affect our results of
operations or our financial condition.

Financial Condition

The following is a summary of our cash flows from
operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions):

Our definition of free cash flow takes into
consideration capital investment required to maintain the
operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In our
opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors
regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations
that is available for acquisitions and other investments,
service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We
use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate
performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different
from definitions used by other companies.

Free cash flow was $498.9 million for the
year ended September 30, 2004 compared to
$312.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2003.
The following factors contributed to the significant increase in
free cash flow:

•

Income before income taxes in 2004 was
    $140.5 million higher than in 2003;

•

U.S. federal tax payments were lower in 2004
    as a result of the tax benefits related to voluntary pension
    contributions and increased benefits from the exercise of stock
    options. U.S. federal tax payments were $10.0 million
    in 2004 compared to $43.0 million in 2003; and

•

We received net tax refunds of $30.6 million
    from various tax authorities related to prior years.

These factors more than offset the higher
voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified pension trust
which totaled $125.0 million in 2004 compared to
$50.0 million in 2003.


We anticipate that cash payments for income taxes
will approach our income tax expense in the near future.

When necessary, we utilize commercial paper as
our principal source of short-term financing. At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had no commercial paper
borrowings outstanding. During 2004 and 2003, we did not have
significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash position.

In January 2004, we repaid our $8.4 million
of industrial development revenue bonds prior to maturity using
cash on hand. In April 2003, we repaid our $150.0 million
principal amount of 6.80% notes at maturity using a
combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings.

We repurchased approximately 7.5 million
shares of our common stock at a cost of $258.4 million in
2004. At September 30, 2004, we had approximately
$168.5 million remaining for stock repurchases under
existing board authorizations. We repurchased approximately
5.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
$128.4 million in 2003. We anticipate repurchasing stock in
2005, the amount of which will depend ultimately on business
conditions, stock price and other cash requirements.

Future significant uses of cash are expected to
include capital expenditures, dividends to shareowners,
acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common stock and
may include contributions to our pension plans. We expect
capital expenditures in 2005 to be about $120 million.
Additional information regarding pension contributions is
contained in

MD&A

on page 14 hereof. We expect
that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by
existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities,
commercial paper borrowings, a new issue of debt or issuance of
other securities.

In addition to cash generated by operating
activities, we have access to existing financing sources,
including the public debt markets and unsecured credit
facilities with various banks. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio
was 28.9 percent at September 30, 2004 and
32.7 percent at September 30, 2003.

As of September 30, 2004, we had
$675.0 million of unsecured committed credit facilities,
with $337.5 million expiring in October 2004 and
$337.5 million expiring in October 2005. These facilities
were available for general corporate purposes, including support
for our commercial paper borrowings. On October 26, 2004,
we entered into a new five-year $600.0 million unsecured
revolving credit facility. It replaced both the facility
expiring on that date and the facility expiring in October 2005
(which we cancelled on that date). Borrowings under our new
credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market
rates in effect during the period such borrowings are
outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain a covenant
under which we would be in default if our debt to capital ratio
were to exceed 60 percent. In addition to our
$600.0 million credit facility, short-term unsecured credit
facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to
$130.4 million at September 30, 2004.

The following is a summary of our credit ratings
as of September 30, 2004:

Among other things, our credit facility is a
standby liquidity facility that can be drawn, if needed, to
repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This
access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an
important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the
table above that have been given to our commercial paper. While
we are not required to do so, under our current policy with
respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other
borrowings under the credit facility, if any, to amounts that
would leave enough credit available under the facility so that
we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding
commercial paper as it matures.

Should our access to the commercial paper market
be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or
otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available
cash and the unsecured


committed credit facilities to provide short-term
funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the
unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the
cost of commercial paper borrowings.

Cash dividends to shareowners were
$122.5 million ($0.66 per share) in 2004 and
$122.4 million ($0.66 per share) in 2003. Although
declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion
of our Board of Directors, we expect to pay quarterly dividends
in 2005 at least equal to the quarterly per share amount paid in
2004.

Certain of our contractual cash obligations at
September 30, 2004 are summarized as follows:

We sponsor pension and other postretirement
benefit plans for certain employees. See Note 12 in the
Financial Statements for information regarding these plans and
expected future cash outflows related to the plans.

At September 30, 2004, we guaranteed the
performance of Conexant related to a lease obligation of
approximately $60.0 million. The lease obligation is
secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within
a range of estimated fair values of the real property. In
consideration for this guarantee, we received $250,000 per
quarter from Conexant through December 31, 2003 and receive
$500,000 per quarter from Conexant through
December 31, 2004 unless we are released from the guarantee
prior thereto. We expect to be released from the guarantee in
2005.

At September 30, 2004, we and Rockwell
Collins each guarantee one-half of a lease agreement for one of
Rockwell Scientific Company LLC’s (RSC) facilities. The
total future minimum payments under the lease are
$5.5 million. The lease agreement has a term that ends in
December 2011. In addition, we share equally with Rockwell
Collins in providing a $4.0 million line of credit to RSC,
which bears interest at the greater of our or Rockwell
Collins’ commercial paper borrowing rate. At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, there were no outstanding
borrowings under this line of credit. During October 2004, the
line of credit was increased to $6.0 million, with us and
Rockwell Collins still sharing equally.

Supplemental Sales Information

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating
outside of the United States using exchange rates effective
during the respective period. Therefore, reported sales are
affected by changes in currency rates, which are outside of our
control. We believe that sales excluding the effect of changes
in currency exchange rates, which


is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful
information to investors because it reflects regional
performance from the activities of our businesses without the
effect of changes in currency rates. We use sales excluding the
effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and
evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of
changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective
period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates as
were in effect in the preceding year.

The following is a reconciliation of our reported
sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency
exchange rates (in millions):

The following is a reconciliation of reported
sales of our Control Systems segment to sales excluding the
effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in millions):

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

We have prepared the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, which require us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and revenues and expenses during the periods
reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We
believe the following are the critical accounting policies that
could have the most significant effect on our reported results
or require subjective or complex judgments by management.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are generally recorded when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; product
has been delivered according to contract terms and acceptance as
may be required by contract terms has occurred or services have
been rendered; pricing is fixed or determinable; and collection
is reasonably assured.


We generally use contracts and customer purchase
orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. We use
shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to
verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or
adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the
creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit
evaluations and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment
history.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates
and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based upon
historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be
required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from
historical experience or if there are changes to other
assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption
used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor
rebate program is the time period from when revenue is
recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period
were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an
adjustment to the accrual of approximately $4.0 million.

The accrual for rebates and incentives to
customers was $79.1 million at September 30, 2004 and
$70.8 million at September 30, 2003, of which
$7.8 million at September 30, 2004 and
$5.4 million at September 30, 2003 was included as an
offset to accounts receivable.

Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying
amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable through future cash flows. We evaluate
the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We use
judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an
impairment test is necessary. Factors we consider that could
trigger an impairment review include significant
underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating
results, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset,
a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset
is used and significant negative industry or economic trends.

Impairment losses are measured as the amount by
which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair
value. To determine fair value, we are required to make
estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being
reviewed. These estimates require assumptions about demand for
our products and services, future market conditions and
technological developments. Other assumptions include the
discount rate and future growth rates. During 2002, we recorded
pre-tax impairment charges of $128.7 million
($107.8 million after tax) in connection with the adoption
of SFAS 142.

We perform our annual impairment test on
non-amortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our
fiscal year. As of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the
$72.8 million net book value of our Reliance trademark
approximated its estimated fair value, as computed with the
assistance of independent valuation specialists. Either an
increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future
growth or profitability rates could result in a material
impairment charge to writedown the book value of the Reliance
trademark to the revised estimated fair value.

Additional information regarding the impairment
charges is contained in Note 3 in the Financial Statements.

Retirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Pension costs and obligations are actuarially
determined and are affected by annually reviewing assumptions
including discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan
assets and assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan
employees, among other factors. Changes in the discount rate and
differences between the assumptions and actual experience will
affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future
periods.

Our worldwide pension expense in 2004 was
$68.8 million compared to $41.6 million in 2003.
Approximately 80 percent of this cost relates to our
U.S. qualified pension plan. We used the following


actuarial assumptions to determine our 2004
U.S. pension expense: discount rate of 6.0 percent
(compared to 7.0 percent for 2003); expected rate of return
on plan assets of 8.5 percent (compared to 8.5 percent
for 2003); and an assumed rate of compensation increase of
4.5 percent (compared to 4.5 percent for 2003). The
decrease in discount rate, as well as the amortization of
actuarial losses, were the primary causes of the
$27.2 million increase in pension expense in 2004 over 2003.

For 2005, we are assuming that the expected rate
of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase will
remain consistent with the 2004 assumptions, but that the
discount rate will increase from 6.0% to 6.25%. Assuming this
discount rate increase and that actual experience is consistent
with the actuarial assumptions, we expect 2005 pension expense
to remain approximately the same as 2004.

The following chart illustrates the estimated
change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost
assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for
our U.S. pension plans (in millions):

In 2004, we made voluntary contributions of
$125.0 million to our primary U.S. qualified pension
plan trust compared to a $50.0 million voluntary
contribution in 2003. We currently anticipate making
contributions during 2005 to our qualified pension plans in an
amount that approximates the 2005 net periodic pension cost.

Additional information regarding pension
benefits, including our pension obligation and minimum pension
liability adjustment, is contained in Note 12 in the
Financial Statements.

Other Postretirement Benefits

We estimate, with the assistance of independent
actuarial consultants, the costs and obligations for
postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions,
including the discount rate and, for plans other than our
primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program,
expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in
these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and
actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement
benefit expense recognized in future periods.

Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our
primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program in
order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of
postretirement healthcare services. As a result of this
amendment, there will be no increase in healthcare costs
resulting from healthcare inflationary trends beginning
January 1, 2005. This amendment reduced our other
postretirement benefit obligation by $86.5 million.

Net periodic benefit cost in 2004 was
approximately $23.4 million compared to $29.1 million
in 2003. This decrease is primarily due to the effect of
amending our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit
program.

We expect net periodic benefit cost in 2005 of
approximately $25 million. The expected increase is due to
the amortization of actuarial losses offset by an increase in
the discount rate (as of our June 30, 2004 measurement
date) by 25 basis points to 6.25%.

Additional information regarding postretirement
benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial
Statements.

Self-Insurance Liabilities

Our principal self-insurance programs include
product liability and workers’ compensation where we
self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding
this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies
purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability
for the majority of the self-insured


claims with the assistance of an independent
actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods
being valued. Adjustments to the self-insured liabilities may be
required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors
such as inflationary trends or outcome of liability claims. The
liability for these self-insurance programs was
$53.4 million at September 30, 2004 and
$51.1 million at September 30, 2003.

As described in Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

, we have been named as a defendant in
lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos that was used in certain components of our products
many years ago. See Item 3 on page 6 hereof, for
further discussion.

Litigation, Claims and
    Contingencies

We record liabilities for litigation, claims and
contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a
basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also
record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates
for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing
information received from independent environmental consultants.
The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and
third-party sites where we were determined to be a potentially
responsible party. At third-party sites where more than one
potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a
liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to
our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or
unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the
only responsible party, we record a liability for the total
estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future
expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their
present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected
by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental
exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that
remediation procedures change, additional contamination is
identified, or the financial condition of other potentially
responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our
environmental liabilities may change.

The liability for environmental matters, net of
related receivables, was $38.8 million at
September 30, 2004 and $28.9 million at
September 30, 2003. During 2004, we recorded adjustments
totaling $16.9 million to increase the environmental
reserves related to several legacy sites. These adjustments were
in addition to an adjustment made during the fourth quarter of
2003 to increase the environmental reserve by $4.7 million
due to higher estimated future costs for environmental
remediation at our legacy sites.

Our recorded liability for environmental matters
almost entirely relates to businesses formerly owned by us
(legacy businesses) but for which we retained the responsibility
to remediate. The nature of our current business is such that
the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result
in a material charge to earnings is low. As a result of
remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new
environmental matters, we expect that gradually over a long
period of time, our environmental obligations will decline.
However, changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy
sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could
result in increases to our environmental obligations.

In 2004, we recorded income of $7.6 million
($4.6 million after tax) as a result of a final judgment in
a defense claim legal proceeding related to our former operation
of the Rocky Flats facility of the Department of Energy. This
amount is in addition to income of $7.3 million
($4.4 million after tax) recognized in 2003 related to the
Rocky Flats defense claim legal proceeding. In March 2004, we
received $15.1 million related to this matter. This amount
is displayed, net of the related tax, in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows as Cash Provided by Discontinued
Operations.

Additional information regarding litigation,
claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17 in the
Financial Statements. See also Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

, on page 6 hereof.

Income Taxes

We record a liability for probable income tax
assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure. To
the extent our estimates differ from actual payments or
assessments, income tax expense is adjusted.


Our income tax positions are based on diligent
research of the applicable income tax laws, claimed with
knowledge, and vigorously defended. We conduct business in many
countries, which requires an interpretation of the income tax
laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to
the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each
jurisdiction in which we do business, differences and the
interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the
subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income
tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments.
During 2004, we resolved certain tax matters, resulting in our
recognizing $34.5 million of tax benefits. The majority of
these matters related to non-U.S. jurisdictions. During
2002, we resolved certain matters from previous years resulting
in a $48.2 million reduction of our income tax provision.

While our tax positions are claimed with
knowledge, taxing authorities are increasingly asserting
interpretations of laws and facts in an effort to increase their
tax revenue especially in instances where transactions involve
two or more countries. Such cross border transactions between
our affiliates involving the transfer price for products,
services, and/or intellectual property is one of the primary
issues we face. Due to our presence in Canadian markets,
Canadian transfer pricing matters are the most significant of
all countries in which we do business. Transfer pricing matters
as well as legal structures relating to current and
previously-divested businesses represent nearly $57 million
of our tax liabilities for income tax assessments.

We have recorded a valuation allowance of
$63.0 million at September 30, 2004 for the majority
of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss
carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit
carryforwards (Carryforwards). The valuation allowance is based
on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the
Carryforwards that are expected to be realized. An increase to
income would result if we determine we will be able to utilize
more Carryforwards than currently expected.

At the end of each interim reporting period, we
estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for
the full fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate
contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned
(e.g., United States compared to non-United States) as well as
tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different
from our estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be
required in the period such determination is made.

Additional information regarding income taxes is
contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements.

Standards

regarding recently adopted accounting standards.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk during the normal
course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. We manage exposure to these risks
through a combination of normal operating and financing
activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of
interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward
exchange contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

In addition to existing cash balances and cash
provided by normal operating activities, we utilize a
combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance
operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of
these debt obligations.

Our short-term debt obligations relate to
commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had no commercial paper
borrowings outstanding. During 2004, the weighted average
commercial paper borrowings were $1.8 million compared to
$26.5 million in 2003. There were no bank borrowings
outstanding at September 30, 2004 and 2003. Our results of
operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on
commercial paper borrowings. If market interest rates would have
averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either
2004 or 2003, the effect on our results of operations would not
have been material.


We had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt
obligations with carrying values of $757.7 million at
September 30, 2004 and $772.4 million at
September 30, 2003. The fair value of this debt was
$837.1 million at September 30, 2004 and
$843.4 million at September 30, 2003. The potential
reduction in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from
a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates
would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We
currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate
instruments and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest
rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or
shareowners’ equity.

In September 2002, we entered into an interest
rate swap contract that effectively converted our
$350.0 million aggregate principal amount of
6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based
on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 4.27 percent at
September 30, 2004. A hypothetical 10 percent change
in market interest rates would not be material to the overall
fair value of the swap or our results of operations.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that
arise from normal business operations. These risks include the
translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries,
intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. Our objective is to minimize
our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal
operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency
forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on
transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable
functional currency. In addition, we enter into contracts to
hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions. Contracts
are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in
currencies of major industrial countries. It is our policy not
to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to the translation of
reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to
United States dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the
underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be
significant to our financial condition or results of operations.

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at
fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them.
Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting
purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For
derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the
hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the
fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize
the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair
value in earnings immediately.

At September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had
outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts
primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro, pound
sterling, Swiss franc, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.
The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses
incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will
offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying
foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent
adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates
associated with these contracts would not be material to our
financial condition, results of operations or shareowners’
equity.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting
    Policies

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or
Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of industrial
automation power, control and information products and services.
The following is a description of the basis of presentation for
our consolidated financial statements and a description of our
significant accounting policies:

Basis of Presentation

Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the
consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto relate to
our continuing operations. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

In June 2001, we completed the spinoff of our
Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business and
certain other assets and liabilities into an independent,
separately traded, publicly held company.

In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact
business. FirstPoint Contact is classified as a discontinued
operation in the consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries
over which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States which require us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in
accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and
incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete
inventory; impairment of long-lived assets; product warranty
obligations; retirement benefits; self-insurance liabilities;
litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental
matters; and income taxes.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are generally recorded when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; product
has been delivered according to contract terms and acceptance as
may be required by contract terms has occurred or services have
been rendered; pricing is fixed or determinable; and collection
is reasonably assured.

We generally use contracts and customer purchase
orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. We use
shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to
verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or
adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the
creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit
evaluations and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment
history.

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates
and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based upon
historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be
required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from
historical experience or if there are changes to other
assumptions used to estimate the accrual. Rebates and incentives
are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or
customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized
as cost of sales for products or services to be provided.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers
are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost
of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes time deposits
and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three
months or less.

Receivables

We record allowances for doubtful accounts based
on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as
current assessments of past due balances and economic
conditions. Receivables are stated net of allowances for
doubtful accounts of $25.2 million at September 30,
2004 and $26.7 million at September 30, 2003. In
addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain
customer rebates and incentives of $7.8 million at
September 30, 2004 and $5.4 million at
September 30, 2003.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average methods.
Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.

Property

Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of
property is calculated using the straight-line method over 15 to
40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to
14 years for machinery and equipment. Significant renewals
and enhancements are capitalized and replaced units are written
off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor
amounts, are charged to expense.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets generally
result from business acquisitions. We account for business
acquisitions by assigning the purchase price to tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities. Assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values, and the
excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is
recorded as goodwill.

Since October 1, 2001 upon adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

(SFAS 142), goodwill and other intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are no longer systematically
amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment annually or
more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an
impairment may be present. Any excess in carrying value over the
estimated fair value is charged to results of operations.

Distributor networks, computer software products,
patents and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally ranging from 3 to 40 years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded
amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the
undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset
are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to
be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the
amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We
determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis
or other accepted valuation techniques.

During 2004, we sold a facility in a
sale-leaseback transaction with a third party resulting in a
$20.6 million pre-tax loss. The net cash proceeds from the
sale were $19.0 million.

Investments

Investments in affiliates over which we have the
ability to exert significant influence but we do not control,
including Rockwell Scientific Company LLC (RSC), are accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our
proportional share of the respective affiliate’s earnings
or losses is included in other income (expense) in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Investments in affiliates
over which we do not have the ability to exert significant
influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting.
These affiliated companies are not material individually or in
the aggregate to our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments in the
form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest
rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate
risks. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are used to
offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated
with intercompany transactions generally forecasted to occur
within one year (cash flow hedges) and changes in the fair value
of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany
loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in
foreign currencies. Interest rate swap contracts are
periodically used to manage the balance of fixed and floating
rate debt. Our accounting method for derivative financial
instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as
hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. It is our policy to execute such instruments with
creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. All foreign currency
forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of
major industrial countries.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating
outside of the United States with a functional currency other
than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars
using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. Sales,
costs and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
effective during the respective period. Foreign currency
translation adjustments are included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the results of operations in the
period incurred.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development (R&D) costs are
expensed as incurred and were $121.7 million in 2004,
$121.6 million in 2003 and $123.2 million in 2002.
R&D expenses are included in cost of sales in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We record a liability for income tax exposures
when they are probable and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. The determination of probability and the estimate of
the liability reflect the relevant tax law as applied to us
taking into account the particular country, state, or other
taxing authority.

Earnings Per Share

We present basic and diluted per share
(EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon
the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the year. The difference between basic
and diluted EPS is solely attributable to stock options. We use
the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding
stock options. Stock options for which the exercise price


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Basis of Presentation and Accounting
    Policies — (Continued)

exceeds the average market price
(out-of-the-money options) over the period have an antidilutive
effect on EPS, and accordingly, are excluded from the
calculation. For the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003
and 2002, options for 0.1 million, 1.1 million and
3.6 million shares were excluded from the diluted EPS
calculation because they were antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. Stock options
are granted at prices equal to the fair market value of our
common stock on the grant dates; therefore no compensation
expense is generally recognized in connection with stock options
granted to employees. Compensation expense resulting from grants
of restricted stock is recognized during the period in which the
service is performed. The following table illustrates the effect
on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method provided by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, had been applied for all
outstanding and unvested awards in each year (in millions,
except per share amounts):

Net income, as reported and pro forma net income
in 2004 include $2.9 million (before and after tax) of
compensation expense resulting from modifications made to
certain stock options in connection with the sale of our
FirstPoint Contact business.

The per share weighted average fair value of
options granted was $7.20 in 2004, $2.98 in 2003 and $2.99 in
2002.

The fair value of each option was estimated on
the date of grant or subsequent date of option adjustment using
the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions:

    Policies — (Continued)

Self-Insurance Liabilities

We record accruals for self-insured claims in the
period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our
principal self-insurance programs include product liability and
workers’ compensation where we self-insure up to a
specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to
specified limits are covered by policies purchased from
commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority
of the self-insured claims with the assistance of an independent
actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods
being valued.

Environmental Matters

We record accruals for environmental matters in
the period in which our responsibility is probable and the cost
can be reasonably estimated. Changes to the accruals are made in
the periods in which the estimated costs of remediation change.
At environmental sites for which more than one potentially
responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for
our estimated allocable share of costs related to our
involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or
unidentified parties. At environmental sites for which we are
the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total
estimated costs of remediation. Future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to
their present value. If recovery from insurers or other third
parties is determined to be probable, we record a receivable for
the estimated recovery.

Recently Adopted Accounting
    Standards

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed
into law. The Act provides a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a prescription
drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) staff issued FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

(FSP
FAS 106-2), which supercedes FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 106-1,

Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

, and is effective
for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15,
2004. We adopted FSP FAS 106-2 during our fourth quarter of
2004. The impact was to decrease our other postretirement
obligations by $16.9 million. As a result, the fiscal 2005
expense is expected to decrease by $2.0 million.

Acquisitions of Businesses

2003 Acquisitions

In March 2003, our Control Systems segment
acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Weidmüller Holding AG’s (Weidmüller) North
American business. In connection therewith, we entered into a
master brand label agreement, a technology/design exchange and
joint product development efforts with Weidmüller. In
February 2003, our Control Systems segment acquired
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of Interwave Technology, Inc., a consulting integrator focusing
on manufacturing solutions. The aggregate cash purchase price of
these businesses was $25.7 million. Amounts recorded for
liabilities assumed were approximately $1.0 million.

2002 Acquisitions

In September 2002, our Control Systems segment
acquired the engineering services and system integration assets
of SPEL, spol. s.r.o. In May 2002, our Control Systems segment
acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the
controller division of Samsung Electronics Company
Limited’s Mechatronics

business. In March 2002, our Control Systems
segment acquired all of the stock of Propack Data GmbH
(Propack), a provider of manufacturing information systems for
the pharmaceutical and other regulated industries. In January
2002, our Control Systems segment acquired all of the stock of
Tesch GmbH, an electronic products and safety relay
manufacturer. The aggregate cash purchase price of the
businesses we acquired in 2002, of which the majority related to
the acquisition of Propack, was $71.0 million. Amounts
recorded for liabilities assumed were approximately
$6.0 million.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the
businesses acquired in 2003 and 2002 have been recorded at
estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible
assets was recorded as goodwill. See Note 3 for goodwill
and intangible assets acquired in connection with these
acquisitions.

These acquisitions were accounted for as
purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations of these
businesses have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations since their respective dates of acquisition. Pro
forma financial information and allocation of the purchase price
is not presented as the combined effect of these acquisitions
was not material to our results of operations or financial
position.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142
in 2002, we determined that the Allen-Bradley, Reliance and
Dodge trademarks have indefinite useful lives. Accordingly, we
performed a transitional intangible asset impairment test that
resulted in an impairment charge of $56.1 million
($35.2 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share)
related to the Reliance trademark used primarily by Power
Systems. The impairment charge represents the excess of the
carrying amount of the trademark over its estimated fair value
that we determined, with the assistance of independent valuation
experts, utilizing the relief from royalty valuation method.
This method estimates the benefit to us resulting from owning
rather than licensing the trademark.

Also in connection with the adoption of
SFAS 142, we completed a transitional goodwill impairment
test during 2002. As a result, an impairment charge of
$72.6 million (before and after tax, or $0.39 per
diluted share) was recorded related to goodwill at a Power
Systems reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was
estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including
the present value of expected future cash flows and historical
valuations of comparable businesses.

The previous method for determining impairment
prescribed by SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of

, utilized an undiscounted cash flow approach for
the initial impairment assessment, while SFAS 142 utilizes
a fair value approach. The trademark impairment charge and the
goodwill impairment charge discussed above are the result of the
change in the accounting method for determining the impairment
of goodwill and certain intangible assets. These charges have
been recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in
the amount of $128.7 million ($107.8 million after
tax, or $0.58 per diluted share) as of October 1, 2001
in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Debt — (Continued)

Long-term debt consists of the following (in
millions):

In September 2002, we entered into an interest
rate swap contract (the Swap) that effectively converted our
$350.0 million aggregate principal amount of
6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based
on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 4.27 percent at
September 30, 2004 and 3.52 percent at
September 30, 2003. The fair value of the Swap, based upon
quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities, was
$3.7 million at September 30, 2004 and
$10.4 million at September 30, 2003. As permitted by
SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133), as amended, we have
designated the Swap as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair
value of the Swap was recorded in other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2004 and 2003.
The carrying value of the underlying debt was increased to
$353.7 million at September 30, 2004 and
$360.4 million at September 30, 2003 in accordance
with SFAS 133.

At September 30, 2004, we had
$675.0 million of unsecured committed credit facilities,
with $337.5 million expiring in October 2004 and
$337.5 million expiring in October 2005. These facilities
were available for general corporate purposes, including support
for our commercial paper borrowings. On October 26, 2004,
we entered into a new five-year $600.0 million unsecured
revolving credit facility. It replaced both the facility
expiring on that date and the facility expiring in October 2005
(which we cancelled on that date). Borrowings under our new
credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market
rates in effect during the period such borrowings are
outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain a covenant
under which we would be in default if our debt to capital ratio
were to exceed 60 percent. In addition to our
$600.0 million credit facility, short-term unsecured credit
facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to
$130.4 million at September 30, 2004. There were no
significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements
under any of our credit facilities.

Interest payments were $40.9 million during
2004, $54.7 million during 2003 and $63.1 million
during 2002.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments include short-term
debt, long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange
contracts and an interest rate swap. The following is a summary
of the carrying value and fair value of our financial
instruments (in millions):

Short-term debt in the table above excludes the
current portion of long-term debt. The fair value of short-term
debt approximates the carrying value due to its short-term
nature. The fair value of long-term debt was based upon quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues. The fair value of
foreign currency forward exchange contracts was based on quoted
market prices for contracts with similar maturities.

Foreign currency forward exchange contracts
provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at
specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of
contracts for the euro, pound sterling,

Swiss franc, Australian dollar and Canadian
dollar. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are
recorded in other current assets in the amounts of
$4.2 million as of September 30, 2004 and
$4.7 million as of September 30, 2003 and other
current liabilities in the amounts of $12.0 million as of
September 30, 2004 and $46.6 million as of
September 30, 2003. We do not anticipate any material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
position relating to these foreign currency forward exchange
contracts. We have designated certain foreign currency forward
exchange contracts related to forecasted intercompany
transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount recognized in
earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges
was not material.

Shareowners’ Equity

Common Stock

At September 30, 2004, the authorized stock
of the Company consisted of one billion shares of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, and 25 million shares of
preferred stock, without par value. At September 30, 2004,
24.5 million shares of common stock were reserved for
various incentive plans.

Changes in outstanding common shares are
summarized as follows (in millions):

Preferred Share Purchase Rights

Each outstanding share of common stock provides
the holder with one Preferred Share Purchase Right (Right). The
Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group,
without the approval of the board of directors, acquires, or
offers to acquire, 20% or more of the common stock, although the
board of directors is authorized to reduce the 20% threshold for
triggering the Rights to not less than 10%. Upon exercise, each
Right entitles the holder to 1/100th of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company (Junior
Preferred Stock) at a price of $250, subject to adjustment.

Upon an acquisition of the Company, each Right
(other than Rights held by the acquirer) will generally be
exercisable for $500 worth of either common stock of the Company
or common stock of the acquirer for $250. In certain
circumstances, each Right may be exchanged by the Company for
one share of common stock or 1/100th of a share of Junior
Preferred Stock. The Rights will expire on December 6,
2006, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed at $0.01 per
Right.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of
the following (in millions):

In 2003, we adjusted our accumulated currency
translation adjustments and deferred income taxes by
approximately $25.0 million resulting from our decision to
permanently reinvest the earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries.

Unrealized losses on cash flow hedges of
$36.6 million ($22.1 million after tax) in 2004 and
$24.2 million ($15.0 million after tax) in 2003 were
reclassified into earnings and offset gains on the hedged items.
Unrealized gains of $6.7 million ($4.2 million after
tax) were reclassified into earnings in 2002 and offset losses
on the hedged items.

Approximately $6.7 million
($4.0 million after tax) of the net unrealized losses on
cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2004 will be
reclassified into earnings during 2005. We expect that these
unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are
recognized in earnings.

11.     Stock
Options

Options to purchase our common stock have been
granted under various incentive plans and by board action to
directors, officers and other key employees at prices equal to
the fair market value of the stock on the dates the options were
granted. The plans provide that the option price for certain
options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, shares of
common stock or a combination thereof.

Under the 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, we are
authorized to grant up to 24.0 million shares of our common
stock as non-qualified options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were
approximately 10.4 million at September 30, 2004. None
of the employee incentive plans presently permits options to be
granted after November 30, 2009. Stock options generally
expire ten years from the date they are granted and vest over
three years (time-vesting options) with the exception of
performance-vesting options. Performance-vesting options expire
ten years from the date they are granted and vest at the earlier
of (a) the date the market price of our common stock
reaches a specified level for a pre-determined period of time or
(b) a period of seven years from the date they are granted.

12.     Retirement
Benefits

We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and
other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The
pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for
monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement.
Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on
years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits
for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit
amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to funding
our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required
by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We may,
however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the
minimum amount required by laws and regulations. Other
postretirement benefits are primarily in the form of retirement
medical plans and cover most of our United States employees and
provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible
employees and dependents upon retirement.

the eligible FirstPoint Contact participants and the other
postretirement benefit liability for eligible retirees through
the date of sale, which will result in ongoing net periodic
benefit cost for us. Also in 2004, we recognized a pension
curtailment loss of $0.4 million and an other

In 2004, we made voluntary contributions of
$125.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan
trust. In 2003, we made a voluntary contribution of
$50.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust.

The accumulated benefit obligation for our
pension plans is $1,768.1 million as of the 2004
measurement date and $1,655.8 million as of the 2003
measurement date.

We use an actuarial measurement date of
June 30 to measure our benefit obligations for pension and
other postretirement benefits.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost
    Assumptions

Significant assumptions used in determining net
periodic benefit cost as of September 30 are as follows (in
weighted averages):

Net Benefit Obligation Assumptions

Significant assumptions used in determining the
benefit obligations as of September 30 are summarized as
follows (in weighted averages):

(1)

As a result of the plan amendment adopted
    effective October 1, 2002, as more fully described below,
    and in accordance with SFAS No. 106,

Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
    Than Pensions

, our postretirement healthcare liabilities
    were recalculated as of the date of the amendment using a
    6.5 percent discount rate, the discount rate applicable at
    the date of the plan amendment. The related net periodic benefit
    cost in 2003 of $29.1 million consists of expense using a
    7.0 percent discount rate


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

12.     Retirement
Benefits — (Continued)

for the period July 1, 2002 through
    September 30, 2002 and expense using a 6.5 percent
    discount rate for the period October 1, 2002 through
    June 30, 2003.

(2)

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the
    estimated increase in gross medical claims costs as required to
    be disclosed by SFAS No. 132,

Employers’
    Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
    Benefits

. As a result of the plan amendment adopted
    effective October 1, 2002, as more fully described below,
    our effective per person retiree medical cost increase will be
    zero percent beginning in 2005 for the majority of our
    postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we are
    assuming gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease to 5.5%
    in 2010.

(3)

Decreasing to 5.5% in 2010.

Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our
United States postretirement healthcare benefit program in order
to mitigate the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare
services. This change will be phased in as follows: effective
January 1, 2004, per an amendment to this program
implemented in 1992, we began contributing 50 percent of
the amount in excess of the 2003 per capita amount.
However, our calendar 2004 contribution is limited to a
7.5 percent increase from the 2003 per capita amount.
Effective January 1, 2005, we will limit our future per
capita maximum contribution to our calendar 2004 per capita
contribution.

As a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act), we have
included a reduction in our accumulated projected benefit
obligation of $16.9 million as of September 30, 2004
related to certain Other Postretirement Benefit plans. There was
no adjustment to net periodic postretirement benefit cost in
fiscal 2004. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost in fiscal
2005 is expected to decrease by $2.0 million as a result of
the Act.

In determining the expected long-term rate of
return on assets assumption, we equally consider the historical
performance and the future expected performance for returns for
each asset category, as well as the target asset allocation of
the pension portfolios. We consulted with and considered the
opinions of financial and other professionals in developing
appropriate return assumptions. This resulted in the selection
of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets
assumption. Our weighted-average asset allocations at
September 30, by asset category, are as follows:

The investment objective for pension funds
related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the plan’s
benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of
assets without undue risk. This is accomplished by investing
plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification
within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines
that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by
plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing
to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring
of investment manager performance relative to the investment
guidelines established for each manager.

As of September 30, 2004 and 2003, our
pension plans do not have investments in our common stock.

In certain non-U.S. countries in which we
operate, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives
provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these
instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from
cash as they become due, rather than through the creation of a
separate pension fund.

Estimated Future Payments

We expect to contribute approximately
$64.0 million related to our worldwide pension plans and
$31.3 million to our postretirement benefit plans in 2005.

Operations

The following is a summary of the composition of
income from discontinued operations included in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations (in millions):

FirstPoint Contact

In 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business
for cash proceeds and a note convertible into a minority
interest in the corporate parent of the buyer. The note has a
term of ten years and is convertible at our option during the
term but conversion is mandatory in the event of an initial
public offering of the buyer’s corporate parent or in the
event the buyer’s corporate parent is acquired. The value
assigned to the convertible note on the date of the transaction
was approximately $27.0 million. The results of operations
of FirstPoint Contact for 2002 through 2004, as well as the gain
on the sale, are reflected in Income from Discontinued
Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Summarized results of FirstPoint Contact are as
follows (in millions):

Rocky Flats

In 2004, we recorded a benefit of
$7.6 million ($4.6 million after tax) as a result of a
final judgment in a defense claim legal proceeding related to
our former operation of the Rocky Flats facility of the
Department of Energy. This amount is in addition to income of
$7.3 million ($4.4 million after tax) recognized in
2003 related to the Rocky Flats defense claim legal proceeding.
In March 2004, we received $15.1 million related to this
matter. This amount is included, net of the related tax, in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as Cash Provided by
Discontinued Operations.

Other

The net benefit of $3.2 million (before and
after tax) in discontinued operations in 2002 reflects the
resolution of certain obligations related to two discontinued
businesses. Related payments of approximately $35.7 million
were made in 2002, which have been included in Cash Used for
Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

We own 50 percent of RSC. This ownership
interest is accounted for using the equity method. Our
investment in RSC of $57.5 million at September 30,

Related Party
    Transactions — (Continued)

We have an agreement with RSC pursuant to which
RSC performs research and development services for us through
2004. We were obligated to pay RSC a minimum of
$2.5 million for such services in 2005. We incurred
$3.7 million in 2004, $3.0 million in 2003 and
$3.1 million in 2002 for research and development services
performed by RSC. At September 30, 2004, the amount due to
RSC for research and development services was $0.7 million.
At September 30, 2004, the amount due from RSC for cost
sharing arrangements was not significant. At September 30,
2003, the amounts due to and from RSC were not significant.

We share equally with Rockwell Collins, which
owns 50 percent of RSC, in providing a $4.0 million
line of credit to RSC which bears interest at the greater of our
or Rockwell Collins’ commercial paper borrowing rate. At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, there were no outstanding
borrowings on the line of credit. During October 2004, the line
of credit was increased to $6.0 million, with us and
Rockwell Collins still sharing equally. In addition, we and
Rockwell Collins each guarantee one-half of a lease agreement
for one of RSC’s facilities. The total future minimum lease
payments under the lease are $5.5 million. The lease
agreement has a term that ends in December 2011.

We own 25 percent of CoLinx, LLC (CoLinx), a
company that provides logistics and e-commerce services. This
ownership interest is accounted for using the equity method. We
paid CoLinx $17.1 million in 2004, $15.2 million in
2003 and $15.1 million in 2002, primarily for logistics
services. In addition, CoLinx paid us approximately
$2.2 million in 2004, $2.4 million in 2003 and
$2.7 million in 2002 for the use of facilities we own and
other services. The amounts due to and from CoLinx at
September 30, 2004 and 2003 were not significant.

interest in Reliance Electric Limited Japan (REJ) resulting
in a loss of $8.4 million ($2.5 million after tax, or
$0.01 per diluted share). The loss includes a
$9.3 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of
the Reliance trademark. The cash proceeds from the transaction
totaled $10.4 million.

Income Taxes

The components of the income tax provision are as
follows (in millions):

During 2004, we recognized tax benefits of
$46.3 million in income from continuing operations and
$18.4 million in income from discontinued operations
related to the following items:

•

$34.5 million resulting from the resolution
    of certain tax matters, in part related to former businesses. A
    majority of the benefits recognized related to non-U.S. tax
    matters in addition to an agreement with a taxing authority
    related to the treatment of an investment. Of this amount,
    $11.5 million is reflected as a reduction of the United
    States income tax provision; $21.3 million is reflected as
    a reduction of the non-United States income tax provision; and
    $1.7 million is reflected as reduction of the state and
    local income tax provision;

•

$4.3 million related to additional state tax
    benefits associated with the U.S. research and
    experimentation credit refund claim in 2003 (see discussion
    below); and

•

$25.9 million related to a refund from the
    State of California for the period 1989 to 1991. Of this amount,
    $7.5 million is included as a reduction in the income tax
    provision and $18.4 million is included in Income from
    Discontinued Operations.

During 2003, we recognized in earnings a tax
benefit of $69.4 million related to a federal research and
experimentation credit refund claim (Claim) for the years 1997
through 2001. Of this amount, $66.4 million is reflected as
a reduction of the United States income tax provision and
$3.0 million is reflected as a reduction of the state and
local income tax provision. A portion of the proceeds from the
Claim were received in 2004. Upon the conclusion of the current
federal audit cycle, which is expected in 2005, the remaining
proceeds from the Claim are expected to be netted against the
liability arising from the audit. The future annual income tax
benefit related to research and experimentation expenditures is
not expected to be significant.

During 2002, we resolved certain tax matters for
the period of 1995-1999. The resolution resulted in a
$48.2 million reduction of our United States income tax
provision.

Net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
carryforwards, and related carryforward periods at
September 30, 2004 are summarized as follows (in millions):

A valuation allowance of $63.0 million was
established at September 30, 2004 for certain of the above
carryforwards for which future utilization is uncertain. The
United States capital loss carryforward was increased in 2004 by
$19.1 million as a result of the sale of our FirstPoint
Contact business. The valuation allowance was increased by a
like amount due to the uncertainty of realizing a future tax
benefit from that capital loss.

In 2004, we reduced the prior year’s state
valuation allowance by $11.3 million as a result of it
being more likely than not that the same amount of state
carryforward attributes will be utilized in light of our
expectation that a trend of taxable income is likely to be
sustained in subsequent years allowing for the utilization of
these state carryforwards. In addition, we reduced the prior
year’s valuation allowance by $2.3 million as a result
of our ability to utilize certain non-United States
carryforwards.

In 2003, we recognized a tax benefit of
$2.6 million as a result of our ability to utilize certain
capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had
been previously provided. The ability to utilize that capital
loss carryforward resulted from the sale of a majority of our
ownership interest in REJ in 2003.

No provision has been made for United States,
state, or additional non-United States income taxes related to
$340.0 million of undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently
reinvested. It is not practical to determine the United States
federal income tax liability, if any, that would be payable if
such earnings were not permanently reinvested.

Income taxes paid were $30.0 million during
2004, $84.5 million during 2003 and $36.9 million
during 2002.

Commitments and Contingent

Environmental Matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to
the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal
of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the
environment have and will continue to have an effect on our
manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental
claims has been accomplished without material effect on our
liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or
financial condition.

We have been designated as a potentially
responsible party at 15 Superfund sites, excluding sites as to
which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our
potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by
third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs
we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at
September 30, 2004 to be $12.8 million, of which
$5.0 million has been accrued.

Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings
have been asserted against us alleging violations of federal,
state and local environmental protection requirements, or
seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments,
principally at previously owned properties. As of
September 30, 2004, we have estimated the total reasonably
possible costs we could incur from these matters to be
$67.1 million. We have recorded net environmental accruals
for these matters of $32.6 million. In addition to the
above matters, we assumed certain other environmental
liabilities in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance.
We are indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation (Exxon) for
substantially all costs associated with these Reliance matters.
At September 30, 2004, we have recorded a liability of
$23.0 million and a receivable of $21.8 million for
these Reliance matters. We estimate the total reasonably
possible costs for these matters to be $36.6 million for
which we are substantially indemnified by Exxon.

Based on our assessment, we believe that our
expenditures for environmental capital investment and
remediation necessary to comply with present regulations
governing environmental protection and other expenditures for
the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources,
competitive position or financial condition. We cannot assess
the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

    Liabilities — (Continued)

Purchase Commitments

In connection with the sale of a Power Systems
business in 2000, we entered into a supply agreement with the
buyer of the business. The agreement requires us to purchase at
least $21.0 million per year through December 31, 2005
at prices that we believe are higher than those available from
other vendors. In the event that purchases are less than
$21.0 million in a given year, we may incur penalties which
are 25 percent of the amount by which the actual purchases
were less than the contractual minimum for the period. Penalties
we paid under the terms of the supply agreement were
$1.3 million in 2004 and $1.8 million in 2003. The
liability recorded in connection with the supply agreement was
$1.3 million at September 30, 2004 and
$3.5 million at September 30, 2003.

See Note 14 for a discussion of our
commitments to related parties.

Lease Commitments

Rental expense was $85.2 million in 2004;
$80.7 million in 2003; and $82.2 million in 2002.
Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated
$210.9 million as of September 30, 2004 and are
payable as follows (in millions):

Commitments from third parties under sublease
agreements having noncancelable lease terms in excess of one
year aggregated $17.3 million as of September 30, 2004
and are receivable through 2009 at approximately
$3.5 million per year. Most leases contain renewal options
for varying periods, and certain leases include options to
purchase the leased property during or at the end of the lease
term.

Other Matters

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have
been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the
conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product
liability, intellectual property, safety and health, employment
and contract matters.

Like thousands of other companies, we have been
named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a
result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain
components of our products many years ago. We have maintained
insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense
costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for most of these
claims. The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigations and the
uncertainties related to collection of insurance coverage make
it difficult to accurately predict the ultimate resolution of
asbestos claims. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our
experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these
lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

In connection with the divestiture of our former
aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The
Boeing Company (Boeing), we agreed to indemnify Boeing for
certain matters related to operations of the A&D Business
for periods prior to the divestiture. In connection with the
spinoffs of our former automotive component systems business,
semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and
communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify us for substantially all contingent

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Commitments and Contingent
    Liabilities — (Continued)

liabilities related to the respective businesses,
including environmental and intellectual property matters.
Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be
disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of
matters which are pending or asserted will not have a material
adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of
our businesses. In connection with such divestitures, there may
be lawsuits, claims and proceedings instituted or asserted
against us related to the period that we owned the businesses.
In addition, we have guaranteed performance and payment under
certain contracts of divested businesses, including a
$60.0 million lease obligation of our former semiconductor
systems business, now Conexant Systems, Inc. (Conexant). The
lease obligation of Conexant is secured by real property subject
to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of
the real property. In consideration for this guarantee, we
received $250,000 per quarter from Conexant through
December 31, 2003 and will receive $500,000 per
quarter from Conexant through December 31, 2004 unless we
are released from the guarantee prior thereto. We expect to be
released from the guarantee in 2005.

In many countries we provide a limited
intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and
conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited
intellectual property indemnities in other contracts with third
parties, such as contracts concerning: the development and
manufacture of our products; the divestiture of businesses; and
the licensing of intellectual property. Due to the number of
agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate
the maximum potential future payments. However, we believe that
future payments, if any, would not be material to our business
or financial condition.

performance and allocate resources based upon segment operating
earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to
corporate offices, nonrecurring special charges, gains and
losses from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses
from equity affiliates that are not considered part of the
operations of a particular segment and incremental acquisition
related expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments
such as intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory
and purchased research and development charges. Depending on the
product, intersegment sales are either at a market price or cost
plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market
price. The accounting policies used in preparing the segment
information are consistent with those described in Note 1.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of

Rockwell Automation, Inc.:

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of September 30, 2004 and 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareowners
equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 2004. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15(a) (2). These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at September 30, 2004 and
2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion,
such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

As described in Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, on October 1, 2001, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Standards No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

We carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2004, of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon
that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective as of the end of the year ended September 30,
2004 to timely alert them to material information relating to
the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required
to be included in our Exchange Act filings.

In fiscal 2003, as a complement to our existing
overall program of internal control, we initiated a company-wide
review of our internal control over financial reporting as part
of the process of preparing for compliance with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result of the review, we
made numerous improvements to the design and effectiveness of
our internal controls through the year ended September 30,
2004, especially our internal controls related to our
information technology systems. Some of these changes could be
deemed to have materially improved our internal control over
financial reporting. We anticipate that improvements will
continue to be made.
